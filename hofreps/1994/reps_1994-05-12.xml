<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present an interim report from the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings relating to the committee's inquiry into the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that I have just tabled is the first report of the joint committee in relation to its inquiry into the arrangements for radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. It also reports on a specific reference from both houses on certain of the general principles and standing determinations which cover radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report covers two major areas. First, it proposes changes to the existing rules for the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. These rules are incorporated in the committee's general principles and standing determinations. They were established in the early days of radio broadcasting of parliament and a number are no longer relevant. Some require revision as a result of changed arrangements for the coverage of parliament through a dedicated parliamentary broadcast network. Others no longer reflect community expectations about the coverage of proceedings. The committee has proposed new general principles which it recommends the House adopt. If the House adopts the proposed general principles, the committee proposes to alter its standing determination in the way suggested in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the report expresses the committee's view on a proposal by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to run a 24-hour news service in the down time on the parliamentary broadcast network. The committee does not oppose the ABC's proposal. However, it recognises that the proposal needs to be considered and approved by the minister for communications. In addition the committee insists that, prior to implementation of the proposal, the ABC resolve with the committee some practical issues concerning the operation of the news service. </PARA>

It seems to me that it is unusual that so much of the proceedings that occur here, particularly by way of points of order which are legitimate in that they are taken in the proper way, are edited out, which really amounts to censorship of what takes place in this parliament. Also, the fact that question time does not have a live delivery any more because of its timeslot has meant that people see only the later recording of what transpires here, which is the censored version. I would hope that this report may open the way to remedy what I regard and what others regard as censorship applying to reporting and freedom of speech. </PARA>

With regard to the decision of the ABC not to televise live the proceedings of question time in the House of Representatives, I have commented before, and I think most honourable members of this place agree, that it is a regrettable decision that the ABC took. It decided that children's television programming was more important than the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 proposes a considerable number of further amendments to existing tax acts. The amendments are largely to do with the laws for capital gains. Most of the amendments are to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, except that two also amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is yet another omnibus tax bill to be brought before this House. There are at least two more tax bills that will be introduced in this winter sitting period that will be considered later in the year. That leads me to the point that the pace and frequency with which the government introduces tax bills would lead an average person to assume that the government has no long-term strategy for the reform of Australia's tax law. Labor really only has an ad hoc approach to taxation that is totally devoid of any long-term planning. Indeed, the problems confronting Australia's tax system have been compounded by this government's failure to recognise these problems and confront them in an ordered manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the problems? Unfortunately, I have had occasion to cite them in this place on many previous occasions. Notwithstanding the reports again in the paper this morning, which seem to verify everything I have had to say previously, the government seems to be making little headway in correcting what are seen widely in the community, business and otherwise, as serious defects in our tax laws. These defects have also been raised in other forums by tax professionals, the legal profession and business and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems revolve around three points: the uncertainty that exists in tax law due to the frequent legislative changes, the extraordinary compliance costs, and the sheer volume of contemporary tax laws. As if the volume of the existing tax regime were not enough to confuse tax practitioners and taxpayers, this government has turned the process of churning out tax law amendments into something of an art form. The problem is that it is not a form of art that produces a pretty sight&mdash;`farmyard abstract' would be too kind a description. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of tax legislation we have had in the last 10 years corresponds in quantity to the amount introduced over the previous 50 years. In the last 10 years we have had the same volume of taxation or an added volume of taxation equivalent to that in the first or previous 50 years. In the past 18 months alone, more than 300 separate amendments have been made to tax laws. I pose the question: how is it possible for tax practitioners to keep up to date with legislative changes and the multitude of tax rulings coming out of the Taxation Office these days? In the first eight months of 1993, the Taxation Office released no fewer than 420 draft rulings. They are rulings on the law&mdash;added material that has to be absorbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any practising accountant or tax agent would need to spend an inordinate amount of time studying legislative changes and draft rulings to merely keep abreast of developments. I pity the accountant who wants to service his clients in a professional manner, because I seriously doubt he would have much time left to actually attend to clients' needs after taking the necessary time to familiarise himself with tax law changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Sydney tax practitioner in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter</EMPHASIS>, which is the journal of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, has written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably the Treasurer has no idea whatsoever, or chooses to ignore, the time frame necessary to implement complex taxation measures efficiently and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He legislates by proclamation, and expects the bureaucracy to write the law, establish departments and draft and print forms and information sheets, in wholly unrealistic time constraints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover he expects all accountants and taxpayers to be instantly aware of all the ramifications of the law, most of which are mind boggling in their complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless all concerned are given breathing space, inside three years, the system will be wholly unintelligible to anyone, other than those who devote all their time to reading and digesting new legislation and tax rulings and attending seminars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Errors must occur in the compilation of returns which creates a serious situation, particularly in light of the unforgiving imposition of penalties.</PARA>
<PARA>That passage was published in 1990 and, unfortunately, the government after all this time has still not seen the error of its ways. The result is that we now have a continuously changing tax system that few tax practitioners, let alone taxpayers, understand. The uncertainty that currently surrounds the tax system must be of at least some concern to the government. Taxpayers and practitioners need certainty in the tax system, this being essential in the current self-assessment environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of legislative change in the tax field is of great concern, but the tax system remains overly complex, unintelligible and voluminous. The Income Tax Assessment Act is now over 5,000 pages long, whereas, for example, in 1936 there were just 126 pages needed. David Castle writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> has pointed out that, if all tax related legislation were to be moved from one room to another, a trolley would be needed. I suggest a small shipping container might be needed. Amongst tax related legislation he includes the income tax regulations, the fringe benefits tax, the Taxation Administration Act, rating acts and the administrative appeals legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Tax Review</EMPHASIS> of December 1992 commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian taxation system has become complex and unclear to the point of absurdity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed the view has been expressed that this position has been brought about with an intention, inter alia, of producing legislation that is so difficult to understand, that nearly all taxpayers will feel obliged to accept whatever construction the Australian Taxation Office may insist upon.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words. Of course, that is what is increasingly happening in practice. It does appear to be a deliberate ploy by the Australian Taxation Office, condoned by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the complex nature of the tax system Sir Harry Gibbs on 3 November 1993 had this to say, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is understandable that the tax law in a modern developed community cannot be entirely free from complexity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the present legislation, with regard to income tax, seems to carry complexity to unacceptable lengths.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act itself has grown, and continues to grow, almost exponentially in size, and has become, in the words of a member of the High Court, `A legislative jungle, in which even the non-specialist lawyer and accountant are likely to lose their way in the search to identify provisions relevant to a particular case.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When found, the relevant provisions may prove to be impenetrably obscure. Further, the act itself may not provide a complete answer to the relevant question.</PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted Sir Harry at length because he has had first-hand experience in dealing with tax law and takes a keen interest in such matters. His moderate and judicial language should in no way detract from the power of his argument. What the critics of the tax system usually cry out for is a concerted effort by the government to simplify the existing tax structures. The government has spoken much about tax simplification but has done very little to further it. I might come back to that issue a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complex nature of tax law and the seemingly endless introduction of new amendments are adding to the heavy compliance costs already incurred by business and individual taxpayers. A Victorian practitioner, again in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Charter</EMPHASIS>, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms we are concerned that during a period of mammoth legislative changes in taxation and other areas, the government has passed over much of the administrative workload of the taxation office to our profession and to our clients, whilst at the same time not making any concessions to tax agents' lodgement programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are concerned that the legislative environment in which businesses have to conduct their affairs is too complicated and has created enormous additional costs . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Because of the complexity of the tax system, PAYE Australians often inadvertently break the rules, exposing themselves to penalties for non-compliance. Firms and individuals are having to spend increasingly more of their time and resources on finalising their tax affairs. The cost of compliance has become an issue that the business community now believes places a significant restraint on growing businesses. Michael Dwyer wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 14 December 1993 that businesses face a cost of more than $1 billion each year in compliance costs. Of these costs, it is clear that the fringe benefits tax is one of the greatest offenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989-90 the compliance cost for the fringe benefits tax was $128 million, which was 10.2 per cent of the total fringe benefits tax revenue collected of $1.2 billion. So we can realistically add 10 per cent to the rate of fringe benefits tax in the relevant law, with more to come. The time employers spent complying with the FBT was annually an average of 1,100 hours. This equates to a half-time worker for the typical firm subject to FBT. The compliance costs for employers' PAYE was $629 million, which is 1.4 per cent of the gross PAYE tax revenue. For payroll tax, a state tax, the compliance cost was around $206 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian businesses spend up to 11 times more than companies in the United Kingdom complying with direct tax obligations, which obviously leaves aside indirect taxes and collection costs. Analysis undertaken by Challenge Bank shows that, in 1990-91, 96 per cent of companies on average incurred higher compliance costs, which averaged $10,129, than they remitted in income tax, which averaged $7,029. In other words, every $7,000 collected costs companies $17,000 or thereabouts. Worst of all, compliance costs tend to be higher for small businesses. Small firms with a turnover under $500,000, for example, spend on average three per cent of their turnover complying with taxation rules, compared with 0.02 per cent spent by companies with a turnover in excess of $50 million. Therefore, compliance costs generated by the current tax system discriminate against small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplification of tax rules and regulation would not only make the lives of many ordinary Australians easier; it would increase national competitiveness and exports and generate new sustainable jobs. To date, the government has spoken quite a deal about simplifying the tax system but has done absolutely nothing to further that end. Labor's record is abysmal. As early as the 1985 tax summit, in a draft white paper, the then Treasurer Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good tax system should be as simple as possible . . . to reduce the burden of record keeping . . . to increase the certainty of what is or is not taxable, and to increase the clarity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>Whatever happened to that objective? It got lost somewhere in the ATO or Treasury only to re-emerge in February 1990 in the form of a statement announcing the establishment of a review team comprising ATO and Treasury officers to examine options for the simplification of the tax system. In the statement the then Treasurer made clear that the tax system needed to be simplified:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A modernised and simplified tax system is part of the Government's ongoing commitment to reforms, which increase our national competitiveness and efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>He further went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the government has decided to build on its achievements of the 1980s by undertaking a major new study of options, to reduce uncertainty and complexity within the income tax system, and thereby make it simpler for taxpayers and the tax administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Streamlining processes for individual taxpayers will be a major objective of the review.</PARA>
<PARA>Where have all the stated good intentions gone? That was the last we heard of the tax simplification project until December 1993. The review team, though, did produce an options paper but it has never been made public. What has the government got to hide? The review was not only supposed to develop an options paper&mdash;from its options the government was to establish an agenda for the implementation of legislative change. Instead of simplifying the tax system in a well planned manner, the government since 1990 has continued to increase the complexity of tax laws and add to the already high costs of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 December 1993 the then Treasurer announced the commencement of a project to improve Australia's income tax law which was entitled `the tax law improvement project'. Hence the report undertaken in 1990 by the review team was not only ignored; it was dead, buried and forgotten and still has not seen the light of day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The December announcement was followed on 20 February of this year by another announcement trumpeting the establishment of a consultative committee to advise on the tax law improvement project. Cynicism is the best description of the opposition's reaction to the government's talk of simplifying the tax system. The government's recent announcements of a renewed interest in simplification are an indictment of the government's lacklustre effort. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 28 July 1993 made a speech to the corporate tax association in which his and the government's attitude to tax simplification was made remarkably clear. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should say that I do not see a need for any significant change in the directions that have been set for tax administration . . . but change now should be more in the nature of finetuning.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Assistant Treasurer. In speaking on compliance costs, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have set as one of my priorities reaching a greater understanding of the major elements that feed into compliance costs, and exploring ways of minimising those costs. I must stress, however, that work in this area will need to proceed within the broad framework that the government has set.</PARA>
<PARA>It is obvious even to blind Freddy that Labor has no desire to make the necessary wide ranging changes to the tax system to make it fair, economically efficient and as simple as possible. All these problems that I have raised in the tax system are referred to in the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of November last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An assessment of tax</EMPHASIS>. Clearly, with so many people advocating reform, the government must see reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have never seen the review team's 1990 options paper on tax simplification must be obvious. It no doubt recommended far-reaching changes that the government will not endorse, because these changes would repudiate Labor's tax policy direction. A complete rewriting of the relevant acts is needed, as is a complete review of our current method of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that is interwoven with tax simplification and reform is the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. I spoke about this at some length when debating the Financial Agreement Bill 1994, so I will not make any comments on this topic in the course of this debate, except to say that it is a policy area which needs urgent attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated earlier, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) amends two acts&mdash;the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This is a far-reaching omnibus bill, which contains 24 separate amendments. These amendments cover fringe benefits tax, accruals assessability of certain securities, capital gains tax in 11 applications, foreign investment funds and foreign life insurance policies, development allowance and general investment allowance, HECS, superannuation funds, depreciation of employee amenity property, off-shore banking units, gifts, secrecy, non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes and entertainment expense payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the number of issues raised by the bill and the breadth of the subject, I can make comments on only some of those amendments. Time will not allow otherwise. The amendment to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act redefines the benchmark interest rate in subject 136(1), so the rate is no longer determined by the rate of interest for a Commonwealth Bank housing loan. Instead, the benchmark interest rate will be determined by the standard variable rate for owner occupied housing loans set by the major banks. This rate will be determined by the Reserve Bank and is expected to gain the Commonwealth $60 million in 1994-95 and $45 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has reservations about this amendment. The amendment raises another $60 million in fringe benefits tax but will create a lot of extra paperwork for employers and will further increase compliance costs of the FBT. It is an unnecessary amendment that is typical of Labor's penny-pinching approach to taxation. Capital gains tax amendments make up the bulk of this bill. They can be divided into two categories&mdash;those dealing with emerging tax avoidance practices and those seeking to redress unintended and inequitable consequences of existing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a press release on 12 December 1993 the Assistant Treasurer announced 10 amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act that relate to capital gains tax, although there is an additional CGT amendment in this bill. Of these, the amendment affecting the share value shifting arrangement is of concern to the accounting profession and share owning taxpayers. This amendment removes certain capital gains tax advantages currently attracted by value shifting transactions involving shares in a company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will apply to material shifts in value from shares held by the controller of a company and associates into other shares in the company held by them. The value shift will be considered to be material if the value shifted exceeds the lesser of five per cent of the value of shares or $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment forms the new division 19B in the Income Tax Assessment Act. Several problems exist with division 19B. Other existing provisions in the act already address some specific share value shifting situations. These are not referred to in division 19B. The greatest potential overlap is with divisions 8 and 8A of part 3A, which deals with bonus shares, and section 26AAC, dealing with employee share scheme provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a possibility of unintended consequences where a shareholder could be covered by two provisions, so there will be a question of which would take precedence. The low materiality threshold of the lesser of five per cent or $100,000 will obviously cause difficulties in practice, as taxpayers will inadvertently find they are within division 19B, for example, by simply failing to precisely value a company which they control when subscribing to additional shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a taxable capital gain can be triggered under section 160ZZRP by the value shift to pre-1985 shares or to shares held by an associate, the section precludes a capital loss from being claimed in such circumstances. It is equitable that a CGT loss be recognised if value is shifted from these shares under a value shifting arrangement. As the horrendous record keeping complications resulting from division 19B are self-evident, I need make no specific comment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael Dwyer, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 14 April 1994, raises the possibility of controlling shareholders using these provisions to oppress minority interests. Mike Dwyer makes the point that a vindictive husband, for example, could use this provision to give a substantial tax liability to his estranged wife by changing the rights under his wife's shares in a family company controlled by the husband. He goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that this kind of problem could arise under provisions designed to clamp down on CGT avoidance suggested it would be far better for the tax office to rely on the general anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA>There are already anti-avoidance measures in place. Are they not working? This bill also amends the repayment regime for HECS to include a higher education contribution assessment debt in provisional tax calculations. This follows the government's decision in the 1993-94 budget to recover HECS debts through the PAYE arrangements. The coalition opposes this amendment. We will vote against it when the bill is being considered in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The higher education charge is a debt to the government to partially offset the cost of tertiary education. It should not be treated as income. The inclusion of HECS debt repayments in provisional tax calculations, combined with the 1 July changes to the Higher Education Funding Act, potentially places onerous requirements on students and former students just starting their working lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill changes the fringe benefits tax to include a provision to reduce the taxable value of a benefit which now arises when an employer makes a payment or reimbursement to an employee to cover expenses incurred by an employee in entertaining clients on behalf of the employer. The result is that the part of the reimbursement that relates to the expenditure on the employee will still be subject to the fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a pettifogging disgrace. Entertaining clients is a legitimate business and a legitimate business expense, and it should not be subject to FBT. All too often we see tax legislation that meanders over numbers of pages just to correct an obscure, if not irrelevant, technical deficiency. The government has no long-term strategy for the tax system except to wring every last cent of revenue out of all Australians, regardless of the cost to business and to individual taxpayers. This bill only adds to the complexity of the tax system. What is urgently needed is tax law simplicity, reduced compliance costs and, above all, certainty, certainty, certainty in the taxation system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which amends the laws relating to taxation. It gives us the opportunity to speak on a range of taxation matters, because a lot of matters are covered in the bill. This bill is an omnibus bill that will amend numerous areas of the tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will highlight the significant amendments which relate to this bill. They cover a whole range of areas, which have been mentioned already, including the calculation of fringe benefits tax for employer-provided loans; the assessability to income tax of certain securities which currently enjoy tax deferral advantages; the application of capital gains tax to certain rebatable dividends; the application of capital gains tax to certain company transactions, including loss transfers and rollover relief for intragroup asset transfers; the application of CGT to share value shifting arrangements; other aspects of the application of the CGT, including amendment of assessments, government incentive schemes and liquidators' distributions; the extension of development and general investment allowances to certain intragroup company asset use; the inclusion of HECS liability in provisional tax calculations; changes to the foreign investment fund measures to grant certain exemptions; minor amendments to provisions concerned with superannuation funds, depreciation of employee amenity property, gifts, secrecy, non-compulsory uniforms and certain outdated references in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; the application of fringe benefits tax to entertainment expense payments; and extending a concessional regime covering offshore banking units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 this government has transformed the taxation system and created a more effective, efficient and, I believe, fairer system. The process of reform is set to continue. It is something that this government is certainly committed to. However, one aspect that will not change is the emphasis on fairness. The guiding principle that will remain is that which states that, if you have the capacity to pay more relative to the majority of the population, you are obliged to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In some ways, when speaking on taxation, those opposite should get up in this place and apologise to Australians for what they let go for many years. Everyone knows that when this government came to office in 1983 the fastest growing industry in Australia was the tax avoidance industry. This government has implemented many measures over many years to correct anomalies. It is important to highlight some of them today in light of previous comments. Since 1983 the government has transformed the taxation system into a more effective, efficient and fairer program. This process will continue in the 1990s in order to meet new challenges and enhance existing programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is always a need to change. As I mentioned earlier, the simplification process is important. The honourable member for Curtin highlighted the fact that the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has established the tax laws improvement project, which is under the chairmanship of the former second commissioner of taxation, Brian Nolan. It is a consultative committee that includes two members of the private sector&mdash;Simon Gaylard and Robert Allerdice&mdash;which I am particularly pleased about. That shows that the government has a commitment. It is important that the members of both sides of this place continue to ensure that the government maintains that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly pleased to also note in the tabling speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) the other night his remarks about compliance. I will take a bit of kudos for the public accounts committee in that he mentioned it in that process. He also said that the ATO, the Australian Taxation Office, has identified a range of areas under the existing laws where compliance can be improved either directly, through better procedures for the collection of outstanding taxes, or indirectly, through measures which can be expected to boost voluntary compliance. Some of these areas have been the subject of recommendations by the Parliamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Auditor-General. This measure is expected to increase tax revenues by $300 million in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and other members of this House welcome that initiative. Once again, it shows the ongoing commitment by this government and the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that people comply. There is no doubt that if every Australian were prepared to pay his or her way we would not face the difficulties of the cost of compliance. Unfortunately, in Australia, we have a mentality that beating the tax man is fair game. People should instead do the right thing and be prepared to pay when they are required to. A feature of this government's initiatives for a long time has been the principles that those who can afford to pay the most should pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I welcome those comments by the Treasurer. They are an acknowledgment that the committee which I am fortunate enough to chair has made a contribution and that the Australian Taxation Office is continuing its commitment to compliance. The commitment by the government to the simplification of the taxation system is important. As I said earlier to the honourable member for Curtin, it is important that we have a bipartisan attitude, because it is not a simple matter. Over the decades the tax act has built up to what it is today. It needs to be examined closely. The problems will not be corrected overnight. As time goes on and systems change, there will always be a need to amend the tax act from time to time. But, in my view, we should make it is as simple as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I welcome very much the fact that no new taxes were announced in the budget. The government has obviously responded to the call for no new taxes. There is a need for some certainty in the community at this time, particularly when there is a big emphasis on the business community to move and react. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken previously on the suggestion that we should have a jobs levy. I am pleased that the government did not bring in a jobs levy, because I would see it as a disincentive to business rather than something that would achieve the government's ultimate goal. Business opportunities now exist under our tax system. The present state of the economy allows the business sector to really respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at some of the things this government has done in tax reform over the years, we see that taxes like capital gains tax and fringe benefits tax were not bad taxes. They were necessary because paying tax had almost become optional under the Liberal-National government that governed prior to 1983. Those taxes were important reforms by the government to ensure that everyone paid their fair share of tax. Those taxes closed two of the major loopholes in the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worked in the banking industry when the fringe benefits tax was introduced. We in that industry were particularly concerned because as employees we had a lot of fringe benefits. When we really start assessing how fringe benefits affected a lot of people, we see that it was of huge cost overall to the economy and to the Australian taxpayer. When it is really assessed it becomes clear that fringe benefits tax was one of those things that had to be addressed because the way it was being applied was unfair. People who had employers who could give them fringe benefits, rather than being treated just as pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, really had the opportunity to reduce their tax substantially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think at the time the government had any idea just how much revenue was out there and not being collected before the introduction of fringe benefits tax. This tax has really locked up a major area of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe a lot of employees were deliberately avoiding tax in that way. It was just a part of the system and it had to be corrected because it was becoming the norm. The fringe benefits tax has actually now legitimised those areas where people can have a fringe benefit. That benefit is declared and the appropriate taxation is paid on it. It certainly is not a regressive tax. It means that people now have to pay their fair share of tax. It ensures that people on lower incomes, who did not have the opportunity of fringe benefits, are now much better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a lot of these measures&mdash;I refer to the capital gains tax as well&mdash;the taxation rates in Australia have actually been reduced quite substantially, certainly in the time of this government. Since 1983 the bottom personal marginal tax rate has been reduced from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. That is quite substantial. That is a 33 per cent reduction in the bottom tax rate. That helps people on the lowest incomes. The top tax rate has been reduced from 60 per cent to 47 per cent. So even people on higher tax rates have benefited because we have a much fairer tax system in which everybody has to pay. The company tax rate has been reduced from 46 per cent to 33 per cent. That came into effect in 1993-94. Those measures are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amazing thing is&mdash;it never ceases to amaze me&mdash;that at the last election, when we were all talking about the need for business confidence and the need for business to be able to get on with the job, those opposite were running around actually suggesting that we increase high tax rates, particularly company tax rates. We have reduced those tax rates over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, I believe, has a good record in taxation reform, which has been essential for fairness in our taxation system. We have done away with that growth industry of tax avoidance. It was not necessary, should never have been there and had to be corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other incentives have been given to save and invest as well, which we often overlook. We turn to superannuation taxation concessions through the reduced rate of tax of 15 per cent and further concessions on superannuation benefits. They are important reforms as well. I was pleased to see that in the budget pooled development funds have been addressed as well. There will be a greater incentive for investment also in that area now because their taxation rates will be reduced to 15 per cent, which is what superannuation funds pay. That is an added incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dividend imputation, which this government has brought in, has eased the tax burden over a period of time. Investors are now not paying double taxation. That is an incentive for people also to invest in Australian industry. These are very important measures indeed that have ensured the ongoing reform of our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing need to have before us bills such as the bill we are debating is in some ways unfortunate, but it is unavoidable. As things change, we find different ways of doing things and we make refinements. This government is responsive to the needs of the community. For instance, if there is a genuine concern about loopholes&mdash;there is an industry out there that tries to find all the loopholes&mdash;the government will look at it. When the community has brought genuine concerns to the government and when the government has needed to amend things to make the tax system more appropriate to the needs of the community, the government has had the commitment and the willingness to come forward and make those amendments. Thus we finish up with bills such as the one which is before us to alter things from time to time. I think there are 24 chapters in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, which obviously cover a whole range of areas. It is important that we are prepared to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the criticisms made by the honourable member for Curtin. What we need is more cooperation than ever before on taxation matters. The public accounts committee report No. 326 is an important report&mdash;probably one of the most important reports that the PAC has delivered. There is a lot of community interest in the report. The deputy chair of the committee, Senator Parer, and I have been requested, from time to time, to speak to different forums on that report. We are getting a very positive response. The government has already responded to some measures contained in the report, instanced by the Treasurer's budget speech, which addressed the issue of compliance. The Assistant Treasurer is working towards reforms. Time is the important thing. The government has shown a willingness to respond to the report, and to work towards a much more simplified tax system than that which we have today. I look forward to the government's positive response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been criticised in recent days because it said that the budget contained no new taxes. That is one of the most positive things to have come out of the budget and is the reason for it being so well received throughout our community. The last thing that industry and workers wanted was an extra tax. We need to give them all the encouragement they want. This week's budget was very important. </PARA>

If he had once been in a bank, he should be able to read the figures. He would see not only a substantial increase in tax payments but also a reference in the budget descriptions to where some of that money is coming from. The Treasury has the honesty to admit that in August this year there will be an increase in fuel tax. That was announced in the previous budget speech. That is a nice old fiddle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government puts all its tax increases in its first budget speech and then goes around the world for the next two years saying it will not increase taxes. That is all right. The great unwashed might even believe the government. But the honourable member for Oxley will not get away with it here, and he should not belittle his own intelligence by trying. He looks like a mug, and he should not do that. We would admire him if he were simply honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So give up on it, and give up on this stuff that somehow or other business&mdash;I come from 30 or 40 years of that activity&mdash;would have been worse off under Fightback because there would have been an increase in company tax. Company tax is a tax paid on profits. Since you guys opposite have been around there have not been many profits in the small business sector. The government's attitude is to keep lifting the taxes that business must pay&mdash;while it is going broke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about fuel tax. Does the government let the truckie off paying it if he does not make a profit? Does the government let the supermarket off, when the truckie puts the cost in his bill to the supermarket, if the supermarket is not making a profit? What does the honourable member for Oxley say when he knocks on the door of those two people at election time asking them to vote for him, to put their faith and trust in him? You are the honourable member for Oxley in Queensland. How much of the cost of living every week of your constituents&mdash;the miners, the hardworking people&mdash;is paid through fuel tax? If you have done your sums, you should know that the fact that your electorate is further away from the major sources of production means that your constituents pay a higher proportion of that tax. The businesses in your electorate pay a higher proportion of that tax. The fundamental element of Fightback was to take away the taxes that people pay when they are going broke, and part of the compensation for that was some higher taxes on their income. </PARA>

It is an interesting factor that, whilst company tax has been brought down to 33c, something I applaud, we find that the government in this paper&mdash;just put away, not too much reference to it; certainly not in the media, although I have reminded it of the fact&mdash;is going to bring forward the payment of company tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wanted to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Oxley regarding simplification of the tax law. It is very notable that we have had the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in this place, and in the media I think more likely than this place, saying that he thinks it is time to simplify the tax law. I think the government has added some 4,000 or 5,000 pages. I will stand corrected on the actual figure, but it is a huge number of pages. The complexity of the tax law is now becoming a matter of grave importance, and in a number of areas it is being added to by this legislation. It is becoming a matter of grave concern, so much so that the Assistant Treasurer feels he should say something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that prior to 1989 there was, and there continues to be, grave concern in the business community about regulations. The government at that time announced it would do something about it, and I note that in the white paper it has actually allocated some additional money to a bureaucracy which it created in 1989. It is called the Office of Regulation Review. I am sure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be well aware of that particular bureaucracy and its activities. I remember its formation. It has done so little since then I had forgotten it existed until I saw that comment in the white paper. The point I make&mdash;and I am putting this as an example of this crocodile tear bit about reducing the complexity of the tax law&mdash;is that since that particular office was formed, for the express purpose of reducing legislation in the community, this government, through this parliament, has doubled the number of regulations in existence. So goodness knows what we might have got without the Office of Regulation Review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now we are promised simplification of the tax system. That has to be taken into account with the issue of self-assessment. At least under the old rules, once the Commissioner of Taxation had put his signature on our tax returns, irrespective of some mistake we might have made, that was it; there was certainty. When the assessment came out, that is all we owed. That is no longer the case. All these measures today are basically subject to this self-assessment mechanism. So it is up to us. We have to get it right and, for years following, we are at risk of being reassessed through audit. Of course, the budget makes a special reference to increasing the audit capacity of the Australian Taxation Office with a sum of money of about $170 million. Being given $170 million to raise an extra $300 million maybe does not even sound like good business to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read&mdash;and this will take a little bit of time because it is rather lengthy&mdash;from a letter written by a Mr Ray Regan, who is the National President of the National Tax Agents Association Ltd, Melbourne, Victoria, written to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 6 October 1993, not that long ago. It is headed `Complex tax laws a problem'. In part, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most businesses these days are so confused with the practical application and understanding of capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation and the rigours of substantiation that the cost to the business or individual taxpayer of meticulously complying with the 5,000-page Income Tax Assessment Act, which even the High Court cannot fully understand, could almost send them broke.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the smaller the business is, the more likely that is to occur. That cost comes directly off the ability of the small business sector to employ people&mdash;the very sector that is identified as the potential provider of this employment growth which is so badly needed. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complex unworkable laws produce unfavourable tax audit statistics.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when this tax auditor goes in to reassess the self-assessment, this is the outcome. I go on with his quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a statement of fact that at least 74 per cent of all businesses which are audited have their returns amended as a result of a tax investigation.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that even the honourable member for Oxley, who suggested that taxpayers think the tax office is fair game, would argue that 74 per cent of small businesses deliberately want to cheat. Of course they do not, and no-one I think would stand up in this House and say so. They just cannot manage. They cannot understand and the people they employ, the qualified tax agents, cannot understand either; and when they go to the High Court for a ruling they cannot get it there either. That is the level of the complexity. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fringe benefits tax almost constantly identifies an error rate of between 80 and 100 per cent of returns audited&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is how difficult that has become&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resulting in substantial additional tax payable and returns being amended for up to four years.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there is a very heavy penalty associated with those periods of time. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the amendment rate is so high simply due to the fact that in the area of fringe benefits there is a different reporting period from that of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is, for income tax purposes, normally the year of tax runs from July 1 to June 30, while for FBT the year of tax is from April 1 to March 31. Thus, to prepare just one FBT tax return you have to review two accounting periods which is a nightmare and often taxpayers become consumed by number crunching, rather than technically interpreting the `minefield' of complex legislation that exists.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the government is telling small businesses in particular to get in there and spend so much time working out their tax returns and keeping records that they do not have time to properly manage their business and expand their business and, hopefully, create that one extra job which, if it were created in every small business in Australia, would wipe out our unemployment problem. That is what business should be doing in the national interest, not trying to wade through a tax system that has become simply unmanageable in its interpretation. The most outrageous aspects of these audits and a major contributor to these high percentages of people paying is the process used by the Australian Taxation Office in its audits. It is outrageous and it is to be condemned. That is the process which I refer to as `plea bargaining'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the laws passed in this parliament practically give auditors the right to take your building over and use all your facilities and you cannot deny them anything. If an auditor is coming I tell people to ship out all their equipment: photocopiers, telephones&mdash;or put an STD bar on them&mdash;the lot. But if anything is there an auditor is entitled to use it. So he goes through your books, at the end of which he produces a list of items which he believes have been incorrectly claimed as deductions. They are of this grey area. The auditor adds the list up, usually to $20,000 or $30,000, he adds penalties and interest, and lo and behold you have a happy round figure of about $50,000&mdash;90 per cent of which the small businessman has not got and he already perceives his business as being in bankruptcy. Bankruptcy petitions emanate more from the tax office than from any other creditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The auditor then says, `Listen, you have been very cooperative, you are a nice fellow and I really don't want to send your business broke. I'll tell you what, you give me $10,000 now, sign this piece of paper that says you will not appeal this agreement, and I will go away and you will hear no more of me.' What does the small businessman do? With a shaking hand he pays, because he does not know what the outcome might be if he went to court, he could not afford the legal costs anyway, and he thinks he has got a good deal. The grave possibility is he does not owe a penny, but if he genuinely owes $50,000&mdash;using the words of the honourable member for Oxley&mdash;why let him off for $10,000? If the businessman is a cheat, he either owes $50,000 or he owes nothing. Whatever the figure is that is what he should pay. I have corresponded with the Commissioner of Taxation and he reckons the tax office is on a good trick because it is a process that gets revenue. He says that revenue raising is its responsibility. Of course, that is not its responsibility; its responsibility is to administer the tax act. I am not sure the commissioner understands that, and that is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that the government demonstrated some integrity and fixed that problem. If the auditor cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that the items he has identified are not deductible, then the person should not have to pay. It should be that clear. I think this plea bargaining approach is outrageous. It brings no credit to this House and it brings no credit to the inquiry conducted by the committee chaired by the honourable member for Oxley. I do not think members of the government have commented on that inquiry. They stand up here and pontificate on a wonderful inquiry they made into the operations of the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine that happening with the police force. I know they plea bargain in America: if someone is arrested for breaking and entering, a policeman may say to the bloke, `I've got you, but if you give me $500 now I will let you off.' It just would not happen here in Australia, I hope. It is a serious matter, and it is just one aspect of dealing with tax today. There are so many other aspects of what Mr Regan said, and I will read some of them:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, in the area of substantiation a most ridiculous situation exists wherein taxpayers&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This interesting overview of the substantiation requirements misses an essential but pertinent point. That is, a taxpayer cannot compel a supplier of goods and services to supply an original invoice, receipt or document with this information.

<PARA>It is a very serious allegation and one which this parliament should address. The honourable member for Oxley talked about people beating the tax man and treating the tax office as fair game. The simple fact is that, on the expenditure side of the ledger, taxpayers in Australia are totally disillusioned with the way their money is spent. I believe that is a major contributing factor in their efforts to avoid paying tax. If they trusted the government better with the way it administered their money, I think they would be much more willing to pay their taxes. They do not trust the government, they think their money is wasted and they, therefore, seek every opportunity to make sure they pay as little tax as possible. That fact should be taken into account also because that is the problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining my colleagues the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in speaking to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), I too would like to raise some very real concerns about the problems of current tax laws in Australia. I will talk a bit about the problem of the complexity of tax laws, detail how great the problem really is, and then show the parliament what I see as a rather extraordinary response that has come from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments add to the complexity of the whole question of law. We have changes to the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the higher education contribution scheme, the offshore banking units, and a whole host of other legislation, which add to the complexity of tax laws. My first major concern is that we are seeing new legislation being introduced into the parliament, but where are the laws that are being repealed? We are building more legislation on top of more legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the record of the current government to see what it has done to taxation laws since it was first elected in 1983. I am indebted to my colleague Senator Parer for the very hard work he has done in uncovering a few facts about how the size and the complexity of the tax laws, and the cost of administering them, have grown. In 1983 there were in fact 2,731 pages of tax legislation. In 1994, prior to this current amendment, there were 6,715 pages&mdash;an increase of 146 per cent in 11 years. That is incredible. It really is amazing. The complex new pieces that have been added to the tax laws&mdash;such as the fringe benefits tax&mdash;have added another 314 pages to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already heard just how difficult it is for most people to even understand the fringe benefits tax, let alone comply with it. The government has just announced that it has finally sunk in that the legislation is virtually incomprehensible and virtually unworkable, to the point that employers are basically ridiculing the government for the stupidity of the current fringe benefits tax law that has been applied recently and about how difficult it is for people to even understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child support acts have 197 pages and the new sales tax acts have 600 pages. It is worth remembering that the Income Tax Assessment Act, when originally enacted in 1936, amounted to just 126 pages. That is some change. In 1983 it was 10 times bigger&mdash;1,328 pages. This year it has increased by a further 186 per cent, to 3,792 pages&mdash;another 2,364 pages. It is little wonder people have no confidence in tax law, that 99.9 per cent of Australians do not even understand it, that the tax office itself has great difficulties in administering it, and that the tax office has equal difficulties in trying to advise taxpayers who are trying to comply with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the difficulties that the tax laws have created just in the tax office. The number of full-time equivalent staff in the Taxation Office has increased from 13,624 in 1983 to 17,717 in 1994&mdash;a 30 per cent increase. It is worth recalling that there have been remarkable advances in the size of computers that have been installed in the tax office to supposedly make it easier to administer the tax laws. This incredible growth in tax laws has resulted in a 30 per cent increase in staff and, at the same time, all these new facilities being installed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth considering the cost of administering these tax laws. In 1982-83, $386 million was spent on salaries and, in 1993-94, $681 million was spent&mdash;an increase of almost $300 million. Administrative expenses have risen from $78 million in 1982-83 to $236 million in 1993-94&mdash;an increase of $158 million. The real increase in the cost of salaries and administrative expenses combined is $452 million. If we add legal expenses and property costs to salaries and administrative expenses, we find that it costs $1,144,273,000 to operate the Australian Taxation Office today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My word. That is where a lot of our taxes are going. It costs over $1 billion to administer taxation in this country. That is incredible, is it not? On the other side of the coin, the cost of compliance to business and individual taxpayers has gone up dramatically. Most small businesses will agree that their accountancy costs have probably doubled, if not more, in real terms. But, more than that, the amount of time that small businesses have to spend trying to comply with the tax laws has probably increased many times over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is one of the real losers in all this. I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to a very significant report that was tabled in this parliament in January 1990 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small business in Australia: challenges, problems and opportunities</EMPHASIS>. This report dedicates a whole chapter to the question of taxation. The introduction of that chapter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area of Commonwealth government regulation which emerged as of greatest concern to small business during the inquiry was clearly taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns were raised and recommendations made about almost every aspect of Commonwealth taxation including income, company and provisional tax, sales taxes, capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, superannuation and trading stock valuation. However the most pervasive, and the Committee believes the most important, complaint has been about the rapid growth in the size and complexity of taxation law, the complex and often apparently unco-ordinated administrative systems which support it, and the associated compliance and reporting costs which are particularly onerous for small business.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that this report was released in January 1990. I wish to read a couple of other excerpts from that chapter. Paragraph 5.9 on page 115 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed the rapid growth in taxation legislation, which recently passed 1 million words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is another milestone that the government probably does not brag about too often, and that was in 1990&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and concomitant growth in tax administration in recent years, is likely to have resulted in an increase in taxation compliance costs relative to other regulatory compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA>These sorts of comments are made throughout this chapter. Page 118 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased awareness costs have resulted from the burgeoning body of taxation law, and concomitant growth in the complexity of taxation administrative systems.</PARA>
<PARA>The same words seem to come back in so many different forms. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net result of these types of changes, many if not most of which have been soundly based, has been a major increase in the costs to taxpayers of fully informing themselves of taxation law and reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>That was just talking about all the different forms and regulations. Page 121 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business argue that taxation administration and in particular taxation reporting requirements do not consider the costs that they impose on small business.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 122 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee believes that the burgeoning bulk and complexity of taxation law which has occurred over the last 5 years places an unreasonable burden on small business.</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation on page 137 refers to sales tax. I raise this point because I will come back to it later in my speech. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. compensation in some form be provided to qualifying small businesses (ie small sales tax remitters) for the cost of sales tax collection and remittance to the Australian Taxation Office . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That report was brought out in 1990. It is very interesting to note two things about it. First of all, the chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology was none other than the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), who subsequently became the Minister for Small Business and Customs. In November 1990 we had a government response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government acknowledges the concerns about taxation issues raised by the Parliamentary Committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which cannot be properly assessed in isolation of broader policy objectives.</PARA>

<PARA>Is it not riveting? He is no longer the Minister for Small Business, of course. He has moved along the line.

No wonder we hear examples such as those outlined by my colleagues the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Curtin. It really is incredible what the government has been doing on this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now seen a more recent development. I point out to all honourable members that, because the government does not understand how to try to simplify the tax laws, despite all these reports, recommendations and complaints that every member of this chamber has had&mdash;and I would suggest that most of us, if not all of us, have brought those complaints to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;what is the government going to do?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has found another way of trying to help people to understand this complex tax law. What does it do? It  produces this wonderful thing called a tax kit&mdash;`Paying tax', which is now being sent out to all secondary schools. If you look in this wonderful thing, what do you find? First we have an introductory video called, `The facts on tax', which is all about paying tax. So it is a new and very important thing that people in schools have to learn about. There is a special section full of a whole lot of ideas and teachers' notes. There is a history of tax&mdash;exciting stuff, new things to learn about. The kit talks about tax in Australia today, tax file numbers, the tax equation and paying and collecting tax. It does not actually tell people how to make a living. I do not know whether that is just incidental. All it talks about is how one should pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is a whole sheet of activities for students&mdash;students are to learn how to apply for a tax file number. It is all about the different tax terms and calculating tax, there is a tax survey and material promoting tax. But wait for it&mdash;we also have a thing called, `Tax cartoons', just to make it even more exciting. So we have these overheads and tax cartoons. We can fill in the blanks and say, `What is all this?' It is all about someone falling off a swing and, as he is probably going to claim compensation, whether or not he has to pay tax on the compensation. It sounds a bit familiar, does it not? These are the sorts of things that are being circulated around the schools, no doubt at great expense to the tax office which, of course, means at great expense to all the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look a little further. I mentioned earlier, in regard to the whole question of compensation, that when it was recommended by the industry, science and technology committee that there should be some compensation to taxpayers having to collect sales tax&mdash;and I would suggest to those having to comply with a lot of other forms&mdash;the government could not entertain that. But when it comes to promoting this little freebie which talks about tax file numbers and which is being sent around all the schools, guess what? The government is actually going to reward teachers who sign up students for tax file numbers&mdash;$3 a throw for recruiting new tax file numbers. </PARA>

Not on your life. It is an extraordinary set of priorities. The government is more concerned about getting people onto some major register with their tax file number, their ID card, through the backdoor, than it is about trying to help business to get on with the job of making a living.

I would have thought that if the government were serious about trying to make this country run again properly, the first thing it would do every time it wanted to amend a tax law is look into the tax act and say: which parts of it can we knock out, which parts can we simplify, which parts can we remove all together so that the poor, long-suffering taxpayers of Australia might have some chance of understanding what is going on? At the same time, when the government does that sort of review it ought to get a few people in there with a little practical commonsense about what it is like to try to earn a living out there, to try to run a business, so that it can make tax laws a little more user-friendly and not bring about all the problems that have been brought about today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is appropriate that we should be discussing a tax bill in the aftermath of the 1994-95 federal budget which again reaffirms Labor as the great taxers. I refer to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). Not only has the government added, as the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), who spoke previously, reflected, enormously to the volume and complexity of the tax law; it has also added enormously to the volume of tax collected. The government's tax take has gone up in the last budget from 21.9 per cent to 22.5 per cent of GDP, a total tax bill of an additional $9.154 billion, up around 10 per cent. If I may slightly misquote the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), only Labor could conceive a budget like this. Only Labor could add so much to the tax burden of the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One finds in the budget papers that PAYE tax is up 8.1 per cent and other taxes are up 17 per cent; prescribed payment system, up six per cent; Medicare levy, up 5.6 per cent; company tax, up seven per cent; superannuation funds taxes, up 27 per cent; fringe benefits tax, up an incredible 130.7 per cent; sales taxes, up 7.7 per cent; excise duties, particularly petroleum products, up 12.6 per cent; other excise duties, up 6.3 per cent; other taxes and fees, up six per cent. In total, for the first time in our national history the tax take will be over $100 billion&mdash;a record $103.325 billion. That is the record of Labor under this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel taxes are up some tenfold in the lifetime of the Labor government. It is interesting that only last week we had a regional development statement in which the Prime Minister and the government cried crocodile tears about the decline of regional Australia and promised in eloquent terms new measures to assist regional Australia. There was very little in the statement, but what was there is totally undermined by the continuing increases in fuel taxation. Every time fuel taxes rise, the cost of living and doing business in regional Australia becomes less competitive. The cost of every item on every shelf in every store goes up with the price of fuel. So it is completely inconsistent to talk about any kind of regional development strategy while at the same time the government continues to impose increased fuel prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have one of the most complex tax systems ever. But the Treasurer (Mr Willis), in his answer to questions yesterday and in his budget, claimed that there were no new taxes being introduced in the current environment. There are plenty of new taxes in the 1994-95 budget. There is the tax on avgas and avtur to raise $24.3 million. There is the new tax on international airlines to raise $1 million. The government is flagging a new tax on the fishing industry to cover some of the costs of surveillance in the fishing industry. There are new taxes on companies, allegedly to fund the national company regulation system. This is not a charge; it is a tax because it is being indexed irrespective of the costs of that regulation system. There are the new international passenger taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this latest round of budget measures demonstrates most clearly is the power of bracket creep in the taxation system. There is no new jobs levy in the current budget context because that was not necessary. The government is raising all of its required revenue, or much of it, through bracket creep, as people pay more tax as inflation builds their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those kinds of measures provide a guaranteed source of increased income to the government. The election promise that bracket creep would be returned to the taxpayer has proved to be utterly empty, like most of this government's commitments. Instead, we have an $11.7 billion deficit on top of the biggest taxing budget in our nation's history. Even that figure is so superficial. Asset sales worth $2.4 billion will not be agreed to by the Labor Left. The sale of Qantas is in the budget for the third time. It still has not been sold, but it has been counted each time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most alarming statistic of all coming through the current budget context is the fact that government debt has trebled between 1991 and 1995 to $95 billion and that in the current budget there will be a 36 per cent increase in the amount of money allocated to pay the government's own interest bill. The Prime Minister said in 1988 that that budget would bring home the bacon. Now he has sold the piggery. There is no real prospect for the future of this country in programs such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers themselves are a shambles and demonstrate much of the complexity of the budget process and tax law at the present time. Each portfolio has produced lavish documents to describe the wonderful new measures that will be implemented in the year ahead. As usual, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) excels. He has the most lavish productions, which perhaps suggest something of the extent of his budget allocations. The budget papers themselves are just amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us deals at some length with changes to the higher education contribution scheme. I thought I would check what is in the budget this year with regard to HECS. I looked up the index of the budget papers, which said that the scheme was referred to on pages 3.21 and 3.26. When I turned to page 3.21, I found it contained nothing about HECS. In fact, there was a chart. Half the page is vacant, and the other half deals with outlays by portfolio. When I turned over to page 3.26, which was the other part of the HECS budget, according to the index, I found a table dealing with the total running costs of the budget by portfolio and aggregate staffing levels. Again, it had nothing whatever to do with HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something about HECS in the budget. It is on page 3.51, but there is no reference whatever to it in the index. In fact, if we look through the index of the current Budget Paper No. 1, we find that any resemblance at all to what is actually in the budget paper seems to be purely accidental. I do not know why the government cannot get the fundamental budget document&mdash;Budget Paper No. 1&mdash;right. I do not know whether it is a diabolical plot to hide from and deceive the Australian public as to what is actually there, whether the budget and tax laws have become so complex that the government itself cannot understand what is there, whether the government made so many last-minute changes, whether the Prime Minister stole all the good bits for his job statement and left poor Treasurer Willis with nothing to say, or whether there is such enormous incompetence on the part of this government that it cannot even get the budget papers right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing that happened when we opened the budget paper was that all the loose-leaf correction files fell out because of mistakes that were right through the papers that had to be corrected at the last minute&mdash;or was it that, when the budget turned up and was approved by the ACTU and all the other people in the ALP who have to approve the budget before it is finally agreed to, so many changes were made that they had to totally rewrite the documents? Whatever it was, these documents should be withdrawn and recast so they are meaningful to the Australian people who are expected to pay a large amount of money to buy the budget documents to find what was intended in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim that there are no new taxes is hollow. The government claims it will collect $300 million extra through tougher compliance measures.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the interesting things to come out of this is the fact that most taxpayers already believe that the tax office adopts a pretty harsh attitude in its dealings with ordinary taxpayers. I was given a copy of a letter only a month or two ago written by the tax office. I would like to read some of the letter to the House today. It dealt with a tax instalment deduction for $159.45&mdash;hardly a huge amount of money&mdash;which the tax office claimed was outstanding on a group tax account of one of my constituents. This is what the tax office wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are requested TO PAY THIS AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY. This will reduce the amount of additional tax for late payment you will have to pay and avoid the need for us to start action to collect your debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IF YOU DO NOT PAY US IMMEDIATELY, we may send a garnishee notice to any person who pays you, owes you money or holds money on your behalf, eg Bank or Building Society, requiring them to send part or all of that money to us to be applied against you debt.</PARA>
<PARA>I read it exactly as it is&mdash;`against you debt'. I would have thought that the tax office, with all of its lavish computer equipment, would be able to get the English right in its computer generated letters, but there is a typographical error. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatively, we could start legal action and ask the Court to enter Judgment against you. Once Judgment is entered, it may be recorded in commercial gazettes and will affect your credit rating. You will also be liable for any costs incurred by us in commencing this action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Take notice that by failing to remit tax instalment deductions by the prescribed date you have committed an offence under section 221f(a) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The penalty imposed on a person for such an offence is a fine of $5,000 or 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty threatening letter to get for an outstanding group tax account of $159.45. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE THIS LETTER, as we will not be writing to you again about payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Using that kind of threatening language when dealing with its clients is bad enough, but in this particular case the client did not even owe the $159.45. The tax office had actually told the client that he should under-remit his group tax by that amount as he had previously overpaid the group tax in the previous month. So the amount was not even owing, but he got this letter threatening him with court judgments, fines of $5,000 and more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the Australian Commissioner of Taxation about this particular matter. He has not replied to me formally, but he has spoken to me and has said that the tax office will review the correspondence. It does not do anything for the confidence of Australian taxpayers when the tax office makes mistakes and follows up those errors with threatening letters of the kind that I have just read to the House. This is the group that is being entrusted now with a $300 million task each year to extract further tax revenue through tougher compliance measures in the latest budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. It cannot insist that taxpayers get every fine detail absolutely correct or they will be threatened with fines and punitive action by the tax office and have the tax office making elementary errors and threatening taxpayers unjustly. There certainly needs to be a reform of the way in which our tax office is operating its affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the higher education contribution scheme. Under the legislation before the House, it will become a tax, whereas previously it was a charge for education services. Under HECS, tertiary students are expected to pay $2,390 a year for full-time places by the year 1995. This represents about 23 per cent of the full cost of a higher education place. At the time of enrolment, students are required to either pay their HECS liability up-front or defer the payments and pay later through the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to the principle of the higher education contribution scheme. I think it is reasonable that students seeking higher levels of education should contribute something towards the cost of that education. It is a very sound investment for people in their own future. It is a little bit like buying a business or making some other kind of capital contribution to get started in life. People who choose to commence their working career by buying a business or investing in some way have to meet the full cost of that investment themselves, so it is not unreasonable that those who choose to invest in their own future through higher education should contribute something towards that cost. There is some public benefit in having a better educated work force, so it is right that taxpayers should contribute something towards the cost of education. But there is also private benefit, so it is reasonable that the cost should be met, at least in part, by the students who benefit from higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the system, HECS money must be repaid through the tax system, which does not start collections until the former student earns above $26,852. At that time, three per cent of taxable income is payable. When the income reaches $30,516, the payment is four per cent. When the income reaches $42,722, the payment becomes five per cent. Under this legislation, students who are struggling to repay federal government education debts will be dealt another cruel blow. The amendments will have the effect of requiring most students to repay their deferred HECS debts a year earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government legislation will have a particular impact on young people who are commencing a business or entering the work force. At a time when they are struggling to get established in life, they will be required to pay higher levels of tax. Those paying provisional tax will be required to pay two years of HECS repayments plus the provisional tax uplift factor at the end of their first year of work, when they first come to make a tax payment. There seems to be no level to which the Labor government will not stoop in its efforts to drag in additional tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a particularly stupid proposal. While the government anticipates that it will collect $12 million in the first year, eventually there will be absolutely no revenue gained from this proposal. It only advances the collection of HECS debts. But the effect on students will apply every year. There will be a new group of former students hurt every year as a result of these proposals. It is indeed a cruel blow to young people trying to get established in life to have to meet additional payments early in their working career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures introduced in the budget earlier this week will compound the problem. The government has now decided that the HECS repayments will also be made on a pro rata basis. As I understand that proposal, if people&mdash;even while they are still students&mdash;work over the school holidays to earn a few dollars to keep them alive during the rest of the school years, HECS payments will be deducted from their salaries. There will be harsh penalties on those who owe HECS debts and do not advise their employers of those debts, and there will be harsh penalties on employers who do not make the deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What incentive is there for someone to take on a casual job to earn a few extra dollars if the government is going to take a bite of that money? What is worse is that, under this casual deductions program, if students get to the end of the financial year and their total earnings are below the tax-free threshold, they do not get the HECS payments refunded. That money is taken. It is gone. This could mean that under early repayments for HECS they will lose a significant part of what they earn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deducting the money through PAYE contributions will guarantee that all students will have to pay back their HECS debts earlier. This measure is repugnant to students. It is unfair. It treats people very harshly at a time in their lives when they are trying to get established in their career for the first time and to pay off the early debts of getting established in life. This is not a time when they should have these additional penalties imposed on them by the government. I call on the government to withdraw this proposal. It is unfair. It is regressive. It hurts people who are least able to pay. The latest measures in the budget merely compound that difficulty and should be rejected by this parliament and the Australian people. </PARA>

It is time to completely change the tax system in Australia to make it understandable and to make average Aussies feel that they can understand not only the collection process but the expenditure process that governments undertake on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has gone to extremes to collect every dollar. It does not care about what it costs the taxpayer or about the number of public servants, computer systems or tax file configurations that have to be put in place to collect this dollar. All it is worried about is maximising that dollar return.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that we started to update and change our tax collection process in Australia. It is way overdue. I know that the previous Attorney-General, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), was concerned about this. If he had been left alone by the government, one of the great projects of this term of office for the Australian Labor Party would have been the reform of the tax laws of Australia. But neither the current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the current Treasurer (Mr Willis), nor the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gives one jot; nor do they care about the wellbeing of Australian taxpayers, whether they be individual employee taxpayers or businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the government's inattention to the needs of the Australian people, today the opposition has moved an amendment to these tax laws, saying that we do not want to withhold the government's right to raise taxation. We say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)its desperate pursuit of every last cent of revenue, without regard for the costs that this imposes on industry and on all Australians;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)further extending and complicating the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax regimes, and for including Higher Education Contributions debt in the provisional tax regime".</PARA>
<PARA>That is the coalition's view on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). I will go over some of the points my colleagues have raised about the legislation, but I want to draw the attention of the House to the prime concern of the coalition, which is the complexity and stupidity that seem to invade the government in gathering every tax dollar without recognition of the cost, the difficultly, and the way in which the taxpayer has to conform under dire threat and penalty to any whim of the Commissioner of Taxation. Once given that power by the government, the train is in motion and the tax commissioner then has free reign over how he collects the dollar and what impositions are placed on taxpayers, including further impositions on taxpayers of the cost to government of collecting tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a wrong concept. When is the government going to be the reformist government that the Prime Minister so fondly claims it is? Sure, it has reformed things&mdash;it has doubled and trebled the size of the tax act. Government members are not worried about that. They have also doubled and trebled the size of the tax bill, the amount of taxation Australians pay, and they are not concerned about that. There seems to be no accountability or willingness to accept responsibility for the actions already undertaken; nor is there a vision of where they want to go to on tax law. It is just a meanness, an application of law no matter what the penalty to the individual may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of measures in this bill before the House. There are changes to the benchmark interest rates for loans offered to employees under the fringe benefits tax and there is accruals assessability of certain securities. That is another interesting thing for retirees, let me tell you! They have had a few amendments over the last few years, have they not? There have been at least 145 or 147 amendments to superannuation that I can remember. Then, added to that, there are the other amendments the government has brought in for all sorts of funds that pensioners and retirees may have invested in. Reforming government? It is not a reforming government; it is a government of greed and avarice for its own coffers, so that it can undertake high profile programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also changes to the capital gains tax, anti-avoidance measures, offshore banking units and certain guarantee type activities, and there is HECS&mdash;the higher education contribution scheme&mdash;inclusion in provisional tax calculations. That is basically the breadth of the bill before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us deal with a couple of these matters. Let us deal first of all with the retiree provisions&mdash;the accruals assessability of certain securities. This seeks to modify the processes where tax is charged on variable return securities. I think that the industry and taxpayers themselves would recognise that there is an element of fairness in the government's proposals, but I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the government has a full-blown inquiry into this matter at the moment. Before the inquiry is concluded and there are recommendations from people in charge of investments, banks and other financial institutions, before accountants can make any comment, the government has charged in and proposed amendments to the act. There is already a process in train, and I would be surprised if the recommendations of that working party did not, in fact, come forward with something far more acceptable, far more easily administered and far less obnoxious in a legal sense than what the government is doing here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a look at the schedule and I invite members of the House to gather an understanding of where we are going to in these matters of law. In the explanatory memorandum, the section dealing with accruals assessability of certain securities begins on page 19, and in it are pages of detailed charts and formulas. I will just read some of them to the House because I know that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), were he here, would be fascinated by the concept of having to explain to a retiree what is meant by the `present value of all payments under the security equals issue price', which leads to payment divided by (1 + r)(n) equals issue price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an easy calculation for pensioners with their slide rules or their little pocket calculators. They would be right on top of what is happening to their retirement benefits with this. On other pages, there are formulas like this nice formula: payment times five per cent, times time remaining in accrual period when payment made divided by the accrual period, leads to $500 times five per cent times three months or six months equals $12.50. This results in an adjustment amount of $12.50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is easy stuff to follow. This is wonderful legislation. People have to go to the explanatory memorandum to read these formulas. The retirees and pensioners of Australia will be just tickled pink to know they can get an explanatory memorandum from the Commonwealth Government Printer. They will not be given it; they will have to go down there and pay for it. It is 165 pages long and, if they start at page 19 and run through to about page 50, they will be able to gather just how this small part of this tax law which affects their investment has been changed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a strange way of making decisions. Some of the investment processes are complicated and the markets are sophisticated in the way in which they take people's funds and use them and the returns that people want. People do want a degree of flexibility, they want a capital factor and they want an interest earning capacity. They want income and a growth factor as well. So I can understand the degree of complexity, but why does the government not wait until the industry has finished its inquiry, which is less than 12 months away? The greed of this government has resulted in imperfect legislation to bring about its desired effect before it is needed&mdash;before it is sensible to do so to advantage the Australian community&mdash;to gather $18 million from retirees. That is the point of my comments in regard to this legislation. The government is greedy and prepared to do things badly, imperfectly and without consultation in order to gather the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the HECS program, which my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has already mentioned. This is a strange way of doing things. I would welcome comments from officials, through the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) to explain why in one circumstance the same amount of money should be counted as a repayment and, in another, it should be counted as something that has provisional tax applied to it. I just cannot understand how the government can treat a government payment to a group of people&mdash;students in this instance&mdash;in this way. Some students who have received this form of support from the government have subsequently decided to postpone the payment of their university or higher education fees. The government has said there is a debt owing and that those students will pay when they start to earn money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concept is fine. Students, having made the decision before they go into employment to repay the debt at a later time are treated equally by the government, which says, `You now have a debt that you owe to us.' On finding themselves in the workplace, those students&mdash;and there are 400,000 of them across the nation&mdash;who could be part of the HECS scheme are dealt with differently by the government in respect of the same amount of money paid in the same circumstances. In other words, the debt against the Commonwealth, raised in identical circumstances, is treated differently at the end of the day. There is no logic to that. I think this is an illogical and almost illegal attitude. The government is going to classify students as to whether they go into business, whether they have a small</PARA>
<PARA>investment&mdash;and inadvertently become provisional taxpayers&mdash;or whether they become PAYE taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not putting in a special plea for those who are provisional taxpayers. I am talking about the inconsistency of government decisions in regard to its own taxpayers, the students of Australia, the young people seeking to better themselves. Young people could leave university, find it difficult to get a job and go out selling encyclopaedias. They would be eligible for provisional tax, and the government is going to make them start to repay their bill to the Commonwealth one year earlier because they choose to sell encyclopaedias rather than sweep the streets for the local council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no logic to it; it is immoral. The government cannot treat the students of Australia in a different way because they have taken up different careers or different pursuits after they leave university. It is a debt they owe to the Commonwealth and nobody has denied that. But to bring forward the payment by one year by using the provisional tax mechanism is wrong. The government should grab at the money only once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another example of a greedy government out to gain as much as it can from the Australian people. Twelve million dollars has been brought forward to make the Treasurer's managing of the national accounts look better. This is wrong, and it should be scrapped. We are going to vote against this measure because we think it is so wrong in principle. It has been introduced by an unprincipled government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to those members on the other side of the House who have any principles to call a meeting of the Treasury committee of caucus over lunchtime and look again at this. Why not do that? Nobody here from the Labor Party can answer that question. Those who are here seem to be struck dumb. The two honourable members at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), are bound by an oath of secrecy. I note that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who is sitting in the back row, will consider this matter. But because he exercises a consistently independent attitude, his capacity is limited in this regard. I would really like him to come over to this side and vote with us, because this is a matter of principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young students around Australia should not be treated differently by the Australian government in the repayment of this money, which is a debt.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, tax bills afford the delightful opportunity to talk about some general issues of financial interest to Australia because they are money bills. I draw to the attention of the Australian people that the examples of meanness in wishing to gather every cent possible that are expressed in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) are also obvious in the budget that has just been brought down. The budget seeks to gather an additional $4.2 billion from Australian taxpayers, yet the government has the hide to say that it has not increased taxes. The fact is that tax is already legislated for. The l-a-w applies to taxes that people are going to cop, not to tax cuts. The taxpayers of Australia need to be aware that when the Prime Minister spells out the l-a-w he is really saying, `I intend to put a tax on you, and I will break my promises when I talk about giving you tax cuts.' So this will be made l-a-w. </PARA>

People will be paying more sales tax, fuel excise and personal income tax this year. They will be paying more personal income tax because the government has not kept its promise to relieve Australian taxpayers of the gradual increase in taxation that occurs by what is called bracket creep. As wages go up, the amount of tax we pay also goes up, because we move into higher brackets and a greater proportion of our wages and earnings go to the government. Bracket creep is in place, despite the promise of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel excises are legislated for&mdash;they will be l-a-w&mdash;and there will be an increase in wholesale sales taxes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the members of the government and the opposition speakers who have spoken on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). As is normally the case in these matters, we have had a pretty broad ranging debate. I dare say that we have often strayed a little from the provisions of the bill, but that is fairly typical in tax debates. I want to cover some of the points of opposition speakers and to make a few observations about taxation issues generally, given that that has been the flavour of much of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, the question about complexity and compliance costs is always raised, and that is one of the unfortunate things about the way that the debate went. A number of provisions try to deal with compliance issues and provide some enhancement and improvement in those provisions. They have followed quite extensive consultation with practitioners in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Following the release of a press release by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on a number of issues in January, there have been quite extensive consultations. Very many of the provisions contained in the bill that is before the House follow the suggestions and comments of the industry as to how these matters could be dealt with so that they more adequately reflect the law and more adequately ensure compliance but at the same time deal with the administrative complexity, which is the sort of issue that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As well as that response, in the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on Tuesday night, the Treasurer made it clear, again in response to concerns that have been raised broadly, that the question of compliance costs with the fringe benefits tax is also going to be subject to an extensive review. Details of that will be announced by the Treasurer in a little while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some winners as a result of these amendments. These amendments also deal with anti-avoidance issues, which are important as far as the integrity of tax law is concerned. It is easy to come in and be critical of the measures that are in this bill. Having strong anti-avoidance measures is something that this government does not apologise for, and nor should it. If we are going to have a taxation system that works, we have to be conscious of potential problems and those who might seek devices to overcome or subvert the intent of the law. That is what many of the measures in the capital gains tax area are designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of share value shifting arrangements and those sorts of things, we have a better regime as a result of the package of proposals that are in this bill. But, at the same time, where there are potential avoidance issues that pose a problem and run a risk to the revenue, it is appropriate for the government to move as quickly as practicable to address those concerns. That is what we are seeking to do through these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Other points should be made as far as the package that is before the House is concerned. We must try to ensure appropriate equity and fairness in the arrangements that apply. One could have a general debate about tax. Having listened to the opposition, I am not quite sure just what its tax policy is at this stage. I know what it was before the last election. We understand the policy of the GST, which certainly was a complicated and difficult tax measure as well as a savage impost on the community. I understand that parts of it have been assigned to the wastepaper basket. But where the opposition stands in terms of taxation in these areas is certainly not clear, despite all the railing that we have heard from its speakers in the debate this morning. I think it is reasonable to say that if the opposition is going to be critical of provisions outlined by the government, the people of Australia are probably entitled to some impression as to what its tax policies might be. Of course, they have not received that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the overall level of taxation, I think the key point that was lost in the discussion was that we now have a recovery, despite the fact that the opposition said there would not be a recovery. It predicted a double-dip recession; now we are quibbling about whether it is going to be four or 4 1/2 per cent growth. The fact is the economy is growing, business profitability is improving, the number of people in the work force is increasing, and that means that additional tax is being collected. That is the fundamental thing that was forgotten. We hear suggestions about bracket creep and our low levels of inflation, but that is a complete misreading of the budget documents. That is the best thing that can be said about that sort of comment that has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal briefly with a couple of matters that were the subject of comments by opposition speakers. The HECS provisions in the budget actually relate to a budget measure from last year. It is not a matter that has come up in this year's budget, in any event. The particular provision relates to provisional tax arrangements&mdash;and that is the only area it relates to, despite the impression that could have been gained from what a couple of the opposition speakers said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends division 3 of part VI of the Income Tax Assessment Act to include a higher education contribution assessment debt in provisional tax calculations. The government announced in the 1993-94 budget that HECS assessment debts will be recovered through the provisional tax and pay-as-you-earn arrangements for 1995 and later years of income. These amendments only relate to the provisional tax arrangements. The income tax regulations will be amended to reflect the increased PAYE deductions to recover HECS assessment debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the calculation for provisional tax does not have regard to accumulated HECS debts and the resultant HECS assessment debts. For 1994-95 and later years of income, HECS debts will be recovered through the provisional tax arrangements. So all it is doing is in fact bringing arrangements together to deal with that particular issue in terms of provisional taxpayers. It does not have any effect on the other issues that speakers raised in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to securities accrual assessment arrangements, the question was asked whether we should be waiting for the broader review of social security arrangements before this measure is introduced. I think everyone regards that review as being very important, and it will cover a broad range of issues in this whole area of retirement incomes and assets test arrangements. What we are dealing with in this bill are arrangements that are of concern because of potential avoidance issues. That is why this provision is being introduced at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical effect of this provision, as far as the potential defect of 16E is concerned, is to meet concern over exploitation involving issues of certain inflation-indexed securities to achieve the very income deferral division 16 was intended to counter. The amendment will prevent revenue losses from tax deferral effects of indexed securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is in the bill at this stage to protect revenue and the potential avoidance device that may be used in that form. That is why it would not be appropriate to say this could be put off for 12 months. If we are aware of and there is a concern about a potential area that could be exploited when it is not an intended arrangement as far as the law is concerned, it would be inappropriate for the government to be saying that we can afford to wait 12 months or more before this change is made in that area. I believe that there is no particular reason to say that that should be put off in any event, given the anti-avoidance issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A variety of arrangements in the bill try to take account of concerns that have been raised about some issues to do with FBT, bearing in mind the broader reviews of those issues and other tax reform arrangements will be carried out over the next few months and everyone will be seeking to ensure that the law maintains its integrity. Certainly we want the compliance cost to be kept to a minimum, as everyone else would wish, but equally we do not want to go back to the days of the opposition when we had royal commission reports that suggested the payment of tax became an option for many people. I do not think that is satisfactory. These amendments are part of an attempt to fairly and properly ensure that the integrity of the tax law is retained. I reject the opposition's amendment, and commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given a couple of remarks that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) made in summing up the second reading debate, when he commented on the coalition's attitude towards anti-avoidance provisions in these amendments and as embodied in clauses 1 to 21 and later clauses, I should make it clear that I certainly did not make that reference and I missed any other speakers if they made reference to opposition to or criticism of anti-avoidance provisions. So I take this opportunity to correct the record and any incorrect impression that may have been gained from the words of the parliamentary secretary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that the force of our argument or criticism called for an end to the outrageous complexity of tax acts in this country and for the government to do something about simplifying these tax acts as a matter of urgency, it having lingered for at least four years, in the term of this government. We also argued very strongly, I thought, for lower compliance costs, because we have, after all, probably the highest tax compliance costs of any country in the world with the one possible exception of the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that was the basis for much of what I and my colleagues on this side had to say. There were three other points we wanted to instil in the minds of government members to get them to act given that practitioners in tax law and taxpayers themselves simply do not know their obligations. The three points we argued for were: certainty, certainty, certainty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too must take umbrage at the comments of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott). There is not a single person on this side who said that we need not have compliance, that we want a relaxed system. What we have said, and I think it is illustrated by the clauses that we are dealing with right now, is that the complexity of tax law makes it impossible for average citizens and their advisers to carry on private or public affairs with any certainty. I made it clear to the parliamentary secretary that the going rate now for advice on any tax matter, even a simple tax matter, is $5,000 to $8,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the parliamentary secretary is in contact with the industry&mdash;he says the government has consulted the industry&mdash;he must know these things. If he does not know these things, he has not consulted. As he has not mentioned them, I can only assume that the government, despite his claims, has not consulted the industry. Even simple matters now require advisings which can cost $5,000 to $8,000 to bring certainty. Clauses 1 to 21 deal with securities and the way in which certain securities held by investors, mainly retirees, are going to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me recount to the parliamentary secretary what the industry has said. The industry has said it believes that these measures are far too complicated; that the objectives of the government are fair, but the way in which the government is going about it is wrong. The government is making it really difficult for everybody concerned. As I understand it, the government sent out documents to the industry before Christmas saying it was its intention to do a certain thing, then in January we had a different proposal by way of press release from the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). That is not the way for the government to manage its affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the parliamentary secretary whether: in the period between December and January was the sudden occurrence of a gaping hole leading to tax avoidance identified? What is the reason for a change in the government's attitude in regard to these matters within a period of three or four weeks? We need some answers and so do the investors of Australia&mdash;the mums and dads, the pensioners and the retirees who have used these systems for their investment. They need to be told. What is the sudden urgency to legislate a change in a complicated form that nobody understands?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the parliamentary secretary has acknowledged today, within a period of 12 months of the reform being proposed, the task force looking at reform of investment and social security legislation will have reported. That would be the government's chance to legislate. The government must demonstrate to us where there has been fraud or tax evasion to justify the sudden change that took place between December 1993 and January 1994. We need to know why the government made that sudden change and why the government has not consulted with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has not been a thing said here today that leads any of us to believe that the government is conscious of reducing complexity and cost of compliance; that its intention is to make tax laws simpler and fairer. We are not talking about policy issues here; we are talking about the administration of tax. We are not talking about tax policy matters at all. The way in which the parliamentary secretary has chosen to misconstrue the opposition's remarks does not do him credit. He has made cheap political debating points not related to the substance of the bill before the House, which is of serious concern to members of the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment relates to accruals assessability for certain securities under division 16E.

The amendment will ensure that if the first security issued in a series is not a qualifying security within division 16E securities issued later in the series&mdash;that is, under the same terms and conditions&mdash;will not be a qualifying series either.

The government, having listened to concerns that were raised about the actual application of these arrangements, is strongly of the view that we incorporate this amendment as part of the proposals in the bill. This and a number of other amendments that I will be working through reinforce the point I was making that there have been quite detailed consultations on some of these issues to try to ensure an outcome that achieves revenue and government objectives but in a way that restores sensible provisions and proper administrative processes for the industry. </PARA>

To be more accurate, it might be better to describe them as `the profession'. I am sure they would prefer that. I do not mean it in a snobbish sense.

Our role in this place is not to check the government's honesty but to check the advice it has been given and the accuracy with which policy will be fulfilled as it has been announced. We consider we have a significant role to play on behalf of almost 50 per cent of Australians, yet because the government has numbers greater than 50 per cent in this chamber it feels that it can ignore, neglect and denigrate what we represent. Surely, in detailed consideration of tax bills, we want the best result for the people of Australia. Both parties want that. But the government does us the discredit and the disdain of coming in here with tax law amendments that we have not seen. We do not know what they are.

I agree with my colleague, we will take it on trust. Let the Australian people be warned: there is no parliamentary scrutiny of these matters.

I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) is explaining to the House, with the best of honest intentions, what is proposed in these particular amendments. But 12 pages of amendments have just been circulated&mdash;including another 10 complicated formulae, for the information of the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman)&mdash;that no-one could properly have scrutinised. At the very beginning of the parliamentary secretary's remarks, he referred to the amendments circulated in the government's name. They were not even circulated. I have just had to try to get hold of a copy so that I can have a quick read of them. But the changes that are being proposed are enormously complex.

There may have been $10 million for that program the previous year and it has been cut to $4 million, or it might be a whole new program that has gone from nought to $4 million.

<PARA>This amendment relates to the capital gains tax share value shifting arrangements. The government proposes to amend clause 23 of the bill by inserting replacement share value shifting provisions. The replacement provisions address concerns which were raised about the perceived uncertainty of the originally proposed provisions as well as the cost of compliance. The proposed share value shifting provisions remove certain capital gains tax advantages of value shifting transactions involving shares in a company. The replacement provisions clarify the application of capital gains tax to value shifts involving several classes of shares. In particular, they clarify its application to transactions involving a shift partly to non-associated persons and, therefore, to that extent, were not to be the subject of capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions are also simplified by the removal of the anti-avoidance measure originally proposed which required taxpayers to ascertain, over a period of four years or more, the order in which the disposal of shares involved in the value shift took place. This measure is no longer required because of the different cost base adjustments made by the replacement provisions to shares involved in a value shifting transaction within one person's shareholding. A minor amendment is also proposed in relation to the record keeping requirements of clause 23 in relation to share value shifting transactions. That is the provision of amendment 3. I have not as yet tabled the supplementary explanatory memorandum in these matters, and I do that now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the assurance by the parliamentary secretary that there ought to be proper parliamentary scrutiny of legislation. I accept that on face value, but I want to reinforce the point just made by my colleague. Delivering to the opposition whip at 9.30 yesterday morning these 12 pages of amendments, including the 10 formulas that are being changed by way of this particular amendment, is hardly appropriate notice. That was the first time the opposition was made aware that it was intended that these significant changes be made. Ten formulas have to be assessed in relation to their impact on a whole range of other very complicated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular area we are dealing with capital gains tax, of all things, which takes up a very significant part of the million words of tax law that was referred to earlier today. It would probably take an army of accountants a year to figure out what the effect of these 10 formulas would be and maybe three or four High Court decisions as well. For the opposition to be asked to fully digest the formulas and make a meaningful contribution as to the merits of each of them with that amount of notice is obviously completely unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was originally scheduled for debate yesterday. In fact, the debate started yesterday. Maybe we would have even reached this stage yesterday had it not been for other factors that intervened during the day's sittings. In practice we have had 27 hours notice, but in reality we were expected to be in a position to debate this issue only three or four hours after the government did the opposition the courtesy of delivering a couple of copies of amendments to the opposition whip's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure of just delivering a copy of amendments to the whip's office is vastly different from the procedure that is followed when introducing bills in the first place. If substantial amendments are to be made, surely it is reasonable that those amendments be also given public scrutiny and follow the processes that occur in relation to the delivery of the bill in the first place. There does need, when extensive changes are proposed, to be a proper allowance of time for the consideration of detail. That applies in every instance, but in a case like this, where we are dealing with complicated formulas and complicated changes to what is already complicated law, those rules ought to apply doubly strongly. </PARA>

Amendments Nos 4 and 5 ensure that clause 55 has its intended effect by extending the type of subvention payments that can be taken into account for those payments. Subvention payments made between subsidiaries and parent companies in a wholly owned company group as well as between subsidiaries in the same group will be taken into account for the cost base adjustments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Were those the words? He has a lot of colleagues on that side of the House who also seem to hate students. This proposal is big into the hatred, big into revenge against those who go to the extra trouble to get themselves across the tracks, pay the expenses of a tertiary education and pay all the HECS fees. They will now be taxed to pay it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the HECS arrangements, the administration is so complicated that most students I know try to pay it out as quickly as they can anyhow, rather than go through all the complicated accounting procedures one is required to go through month after month, year after year. But this proposal will now require, through the administrative arrangements, HECS payments to be a part of the PAYE system. As part of the tax system, provisional tax will now have to be paid in relation to these HECS payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the iniquitous thing about these measures is that from now on when young people enter the work force for the first time, in the first year in which they are required to pay tax they will not only have to pay one year of HECS debts&mdash;as they have had to do for some years now&mdash;they will have to pay two years of HECS debts up-front, plus the provisional tax uplift factor, which is currently eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there will be this double whammy, this double penalty, just at the time when young people are trying to get established, perhaps opening their first business or selling their first encyclopedia, as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) spoke of earlier. Perhaps they will have worked briefly in their spare time during their holiday periods to earn a little to get themselves through their career. They will now be required to pay this double penalty, this double dose of HECS, up-front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I am not opposed to the principle of HECS, but I am opposed to the principle of turning what was a fee and a loan into a tax. That principle should be rejected by all Australians. The government should stop this savage assault on young Australian workers&mdash;an assault that is directed specifically against the poorer sectors of our community, those who have had to get their education the hard way. Those people should be encouraged and rewarded, not penalised</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has almost developed a fetish against those people who are self-employed, and in its anxiety to bring them into some sort of PAYE concept has introduced this measure to apply to HECS repayments. It is completely inappropriate. The government should be raising a tax bill against former students on an annual basis. It does not matter whether they are PAYE taxpayers or provisional taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are these people we are examining in trying to understand why the government is doing this sort of thing? The wealthy students and their families, as my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) has already said, pay their fees up-front. They get a 15 per cent discount; there is a benefit in paying early. The ones who cannot pay tend to be the battlers, and they pay after they have completed their courses. What sorts of classifications are we looking at for these students from battling families who subsequently find work and then have to repay the government's bill raised against them for their university or college fees? Some of them will be going into employment, and as PAYE taxpayers they are accounted for. They get a job and leave university or their place of study and they are accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small group that we are looking at are those who will be provisional taxpayers, those who are not on a regular payroll and who are by means of investment or other effort basically working for themselves. An encyclopedia salesman is a perfect example. What young person has not sold encyclopedias while waiting to get a job following university?  They could also be mature age students who have set aside an amount of money, an investment, on which they are living whilst they study, seeking to gain employment but finding it difficult to gain employment in this climate. Because they have an investment set aside they are provisional taxpayers. And the government is going to tax them, too. Males in the age group of 35 to 50 are a critical group in the employment scene today. I instance somebody who has gone back to university or college and studied, and who has a small saving&mdash;or whose family has a small saving&mdash;and whose wife is not finding work. The government is going to say to that person, `You are a provisional taxpayer for this HECS money; we are going to build it into your provisional tax bill and we are going to make you forward pay by a year.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may not be a full year. I understand how provisional tax works. Most members of the House may be provisional taxpayers, so we understand how it works. But why does the government want to forward charge? Why can it not be raised against that individual as an annual tax bill? It is an easy thing to do. It is a debt they owe to the Commonwealth. They should repay it; we are not arguing about that. Why build it into the provisional tax process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may also be the government's wish to get money back quickly out of the so-called highly paid and wealthy professionals: the small number of doctors, lawyers and accountants that graduate each year. Some of them start work for themselves, but they must be tiny in number. Is there the concept in the government's mind that there is huge wealth out there in the case of students who have just finished their courses and started work, so that it feels that it has to get that money back quickly and it will make them provisional taxpayers if they are in the professions? The government is hitting the wrong people. Its target is wrong. It is hitting the battlers, the self-starters, those who could not afford to pay their fees up-front. Now it is going to penalise them by bringing forward their provisional tax payment. I would like to hear the parliamentary secretary's explanation and rationale for such an unjust approach to student fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred in the second reading debate to the rationale for the provision that is contained in the bill. The explanatory memorandum at page 124 makes the point that the approach that has been taken here is consistent with the existing legislation, which requires a HECS assessment debt to be treated as income tax assessed. What is being done here is to apply that in the provisional tax area. I make the point, as I did earlier, that this provision relates it to provisional tax. This involves some bringing forward of revenue in 1994-95 and a smaller amount in 1995-96 but it will have no revenue impact thereafter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of it after that is simply to treat the arrangements consistently between provisional taxpayers and non-provisional taxpayers. That is what the effect is. The principle is that provisional taxpayers pay towards their tax liability as they go. So do PAYE taxpayers. PAYE taxpayers must take the HECS into account in their instalments. These amendments mean that provisional taxpayers will do so as well. Provisional taxpayers will still pay as they go, later than PAYE taxpayers do. That will be the net effect of the changes that are going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I appreciate the points that are being made by opposition speakers, but I think the rationale for the consistency of approach is reasonable. I believe the opposition that has been raised to these amendments is such that they should not be supported by the House. The government adheres to its position as outlined in the bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there would be some consistency between applying provisional tax and deducting these amounts from PAYE taxpayers, but the government is proposing a new regime of collections which will affect both PAYE taxpayers and provisional taxpayers. I am advised that the regulations are being adjusted so that in the future HECS payments will be deducted from PAYE taxpayers. That being the case, the government is developing a whole new regime of measures, the principle of which is wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>It gives me great pleasure to introduce in the House the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Bill 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Excise) Bill 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Customs) Bill 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (General) Bill 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that on 1 March 1994 parliament passed a package of seven agricultural and veterinary chemical acts which included three levy acts and a collection act. Commencement of these acts is dependent on the states and territories passing legislation adopting the agricultural and veterinary chemicals code. While the states and the Northern Territory are attempting to pass the legislation in time for 1 July 1994 commencement of the scheme, it is by no means certain that this will occur. Thus the cost recovery program for the national registration scheme might not be in place for 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals&mdash;the NRA&mdash;was established in June 1993 as an independent, self-funding regulatory body to administer the national registration scheme. The NRA is now undertaking the evaluation of chemical products with the states providing the actual registration certificate by administrative arrangement, pending commencement of the March legislation. The government has therefore decided to introduce three interim levy bills and an interim collection bill to implement an interim cost recovery program. These bills will only apply for 1994-95 in the event that the March legislation is not in place by 1 July 1994. The cost to industry under these bills is the same as would be imposed if the March legislation had commenced. The NRA will manage the cost recovery program associated with these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim levy will be a significant component of the scheme's cost recovery program. Other revenue will be collected through application fees. In 1994-95, 83 per cent of the scheme's user attributable costs will be recovered from the agricultural and veterinary chemical industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the bills. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Bill will provide the NRA with the mechanism by which an interim levy on agricultural and veterinary chemical products can be collected. The bill identifies how liability for payment of an interim levy charge will be determined and the amount of the interim levy that will be imposed. Generally speaking, liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of agricultural and veterinary chemical products manufactured in, or imported into, Australia. In addition, the bill allows for the NRA to make an assessment as to whether a levy payment is required and the amount of the levy that is due. It also makes provisions for a review process for persons dissatisfied with the levy assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Excise) Bill 1994 will impose an interim levy on the sale or disposal of agricultural and veterinary chemical products manufactured in Australia. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (Customs) Bill 1994 will impose an interim levy on the sale or disposal of agricultural and veterinary chemical products imported into Australia and sold wholesale. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products Interim Levy Imposition (General) Bill 1994 will impose an interim levy on the sale or disposal of agricultural and veterinary chemical products imported into Australia and sold directly at retail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994 to provide that, when that act commences, the 1993 levy will not be collected twice. It will be collected by the interim collection act. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 to provide that the interim levy or late penalty payment forms part of the national registration scheme's cost recovery mechanism. Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition will not be opposing this package of bills. However, I would like to make it quite plain that we hope it will not be necessary to use them. We have been advised that they will not be necessary if Queensland and Victoria get complementary legislation through their respective parliaments in enough of a hurry so that the commencement on 1 July of the agricultural and veterinary chemicals national registration scheme can occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the user-pays concept behind the collection of levies in this instance but we warn the government that when the user pays the user has a right to expect that the service delivered will be efficient and cost effective. We want to make it quite plain that we do not want the registration authority developing into another body like AQIS where overmanning has reached an art form and where other inefficiencies, coupled with that overmanning, have resulted in the government having to engage in some serious reform at last of that instrumentality, including having made available in the last budget over $15 million to wind back on the number of inspectors, given that some 700 out of about 1,700 are regarded as surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want a lean, mean machine, if I can put it that way, that will work actively to reduce the cost of registration rather than to increase it. After all, the national scheme is being established ostensibly to cut out the duplication involved in having to register chemicals in each state. We need to make sure that we achieve the savings needed by the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has insisted on an 83 per cent recovery of cost of the registration scheme next financial year and of 100 per cent recovery each year following. There is always the problem, always the temptation, that, when public servants are assured of having all of their costs covered without an upper limit, they employ more resources than is really necessary. The coalition will be keeping a very keen eye on the costs charged to farmers because in the end they have to foot the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been assured that this legislation, which will increase the levy on products when it is sold rather than the registration fee, will not be fully available because of the problems in Victoria and Queensland with getting their legislation through. It will have a 12-month sunset clause and charging will then revert to the arrangements set out in the legislation which we recently passed through this House. That sets up a three-tiered method of payment: an application fee paid when an outfit applies to have a new chemical registered, a re-registration fee, and a levy on products sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also been assured that this legislation will not increase the overall amount paid, rather it will simply transfer the amount that would have been paid for re-registration to the product levy. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Association is happy with the legislation because it is only an interim measure. It does want the new legislation to start on 1 July and accordingly, as I said before, the opposition will not oppose these bills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was astounded today when the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) said that the introduction of this package of bills gave him great pleasure. The minister is easily pleased. This legislation was brought into the House on 1 March 1994. We are simply rehashing what we did at that time because of the failure of some states to get the legislation in place. It is not a measure that gives me great pleasure in any sense of the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to say much more on this because it was covered very well in the March legislation. But this is an example of where the Commonwealth is being extremely cooperative in putting in place this mechanism in case the states fail to uphold that which they undertook to do at the time. And it is pleasing to see that it has bipartisan support. Why it should not have bipartisan support would be beyond me considering the debate we had on 1 March. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the National Party of Australia, I have some concern about full cost recovery measures when there is no restraint on those costs recovered. Having looked through the explanatory memorandum and the bill, I cannot see a mechanism which puts constraints on the National Registration Authority to be economical in its processes. I hope it is. I hope it is very diligent in that area, and I hope that when this legislation is no longer required and it passes to the legislation which we passed on 1 March a continued control is kept on those costs, for there is no doubt a great temptation, when other people are paying, to increase those costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also am concerned that there are elements of society that might want to expand the power of this legislation. It has been suggested, for instance, that part of the levies should be used to cover environmental monitoring of the effects of chemicals. I think this would be entirely inappropriate, and it certainly would be unfair to levy it across the board, for many of the chemicals registered will have absolutely no impact environmentally and the charge then for what would in fact be extensions of the power of the NRA would be inequitable and not at all in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often asked what the government is doing to reduce the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This is actually a silly question. There may be no reason for the government to seek to reduce the use of those. In fact there may be very good reason to increase it. It would depend entirely on the specific chemical and the specific outcomes of the use of that chemical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get a little tired of people who talk to me about sustainable development and how we must have organically grown material, for instance. I am reminded of the words of a great professor of chemistry who made the very profound statement that a molecule is a molecule is a molecule. People are being silly when they claim that because something is natural it has no effect or its effects are benign whereas the man-made molecule&mdash;though it has to be exactly the same&mdash;has very detrimental effects. There is quite a lot of that kind of talk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that there is a great move to reduce the use of agricultural chemicals by genetic breeding. When a plant is genetically bred, the chemicals that the plant itself produces to protect itself are genetically enhanced so that the chemicals are in greater abundance. It is quite conceivable that human beings will end up consuming more of those same molecules through the natural process than they would by the application of the chemical in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is in no way to be construed as advocacy of the misuse of chemicals. I think chemicals should be very carefully treated. But that goes for naturally occurring chemicals as well. Some of these natural chemicals are far more powerful, far more finely engineered, far more potent than those made by man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we do not see this bill allowing any kind of misuse of the powers of the registration authority to creep in. In its present form it certainly does not have that effect, and I do not believe there is any such intention on the part of the minister&mdash;in fact, I know there is no such intention. It is a danger, though, about which we must be very vigilant in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, there is not a lot more one can say on this bill. I believe it is essential that we have legislation in place in case it is needed. There is no need to take up more of the House's time on this particular issue. I thank the House. </PARA>

I may not be as pleased as the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) apparently was when he drew that vexed comment from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), but I was particularly encouraged by the remarks of the honourable member. When the honourable member stood up and said, `I like the National Party', I thought that was an astonishing remark coming from him which deserves highlighting in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up those sentiments that the honourable member uttered and indicate that I support the concern he has expressed about what has been a widespread attitude that somehow agricultural chemicals were synonymous with all that was evil. Frankly, I think we need to recognise that it has been the assiduous use of agricultural chemicals that has enabled us to effectively feed the world and solve what have been a number of major pesticide and weedicide problems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I entirely agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. It is worth noting that the professional users of agricultural chemicals, the farmers, are the ones who are most anxious to ensure that the dosage rate that is used on their crops is an accurate one. I am not suggesting they do that because they are motivated solely by a need to be concerned members of the community; they do it also because the cost of using chemicals in other than an accurate measure is a cost directly borne by the farmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true to say that decades ago agricultural chemicals were rather casually used, what I find most encouraging&mdash;something that the parliament refuses to acknowledge&mdash;is that in 1994 there is a real effort, particularly by the professional agricultural operators, to find all of the alternatives to chemicals, all of those safer alternatives, all of those natural alternatives, alluded to by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, before they move back to the harsh chemicals that characterised the earlier use of chemicals in agricultural and veterinary situations. We find in 1994, and in fact we have had for the last 10 years or so, the extensive use of pheromone lures, for example, to reduce the number of pests in pome fruit crops particularly. On one gardening show I heard somebody referring to colourful sticky strips that had attracted a particular pest, and that pest had been trapped by stepping onto this sticky strip. So in many ways farmers have been among those who have been most anxious to encourage the natural cycle and to use chemicals only to complement what nature is already doing, just as the honourable member has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to consider that the pests that farmers have found to be of most use to them in encouraging the natural cycle of control are pests that we would have labelled in the past and would still label today as parasites. It is a bit sad that the term `parasite' has come to be largely used as a term that is offensive. A parasite is so named because it lives off others. It is a term that you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, has at times been unkindly directed to those of us who practise this noble profession. But the term `parasite' is in fact somewhat of a misnomer because in many ways it is the capacity of one little insect to live off another little insect that enables us to exercise biological control, and to exercise biological control that is now largely encouraged by the careful use of safe chemicals. This move towards having targeted chemicals that focus on a particular pest without destroying the parasites and that allow the parasites then to be present to minimise any further pest build-up is something that ought to be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we move into this area of new chemicals, particularly chemicals specifically targeted to a pest, the need for registration and for some regulation is self-evident. But I pick up the points made by both the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and point out that the reservation we have about this particular legislation is that we would not want the testing authority to feel that here was a reservoir of funds that could be easily tapped and that the costs that were incurred in registration could easily be met by the industry simply by raising the levies as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the legislation before the House most certainly does not do that. In fact, the legislation simply allows the Commonwealth to act in a way that accommodates what has been the failure of the Queensland and Victorian governments to put complementary legislation in place. In fact, it would be uncharitable of me, but not unreasonable, to observe that some would think that in this instance it was the governments of Queensland and Victoria that had been the parasites&mdash;if I were to take the illustration I used earlier just a little further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side of the House agree that the government has no choice but to introduce this interim measure. We realise that it is here only while the government awaits complementary legislation. We recognise, as the honourable member for Gwydir has said, that it is subject to sunset legislation and, therefore, may not ever be acted on. From my perspective and, I suspect, from the perspective of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, what I have called this parasitic action, unintended though it may have been, by the governments of Queensland and Victoria has at least had one use: it has allowed both the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and me to put a particular point of view about the use of pesticides, weedicides and chemicals in agricultural and veterinary practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that note that I wish to make a few concluding remarks. Some of my farmers and fruit growers have come to me with a concern about the legislation, and their concern has been focused on those chemicals that have had long use in agricultural and horticultural practice in Australia. There are chemicals, as you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that are now out of patent. Because they are out of patent they are relatively freely available to all manufacturing companies. Chemicals in horticulture, particularly chemicals such as Dithane and mancozeb, are now widely manufactured. They are recognised by horticulturalists as having a very low toxicity level, and they have a very useful role in fungus control, particularly in horticultural crops. The concern that has been expressed, and it is a concern that I want to bring to the registration authority by way of this legislation, is that these chemicals, which are now out of patent and freely available, will incur a particular cost when anyone goes to have them registered and to have their maximum residue levels assessed. In the assessment of these maximum residue levels, the particular cost that has been involved will ultimately have to be borne by the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers have said to me that it may well be that, because these chemicals are now out of patent and can be manufactured by anybody, there will be no-one prepared to bear the cost of having the maximum residue levels assessed and then put back on the market, because having them successfully registered will mean they are once again available to everyone at a cost that will not have been borne by all of the companies. The cost will have been borne only by the company that chose to have the MRLs assessed. This may pose a difficulty that I would rather like the authority to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, to be fair to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), that his office has been cooperative in taking this issue up. But I do think it is worth looking at what we do to ensure that what are effective chemicals, now out of patent, are not lost to the industry because the cost of having the MRLs assessed makes it unattractive for any individual manufacturer to go ahead with that manufacturing process. This may seem like a relatively incidental matter, but I am told the cost of assessing MRLs could run up to $50,000. Clearly, no manufacturer wants to outlay that $50,000 only to discover that, having had this chemical registered, all of his competing manufacturers are then in the marketplace without having had to bear that initial registration cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In common with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie and the honourable member for Gwydir, I have little else to add. Clearly, the opposition and the government agree that this is regrettable, but necessary, legislation. What we would like is to see wider recognition of the fact that chemicals have an important, significant and progressive role to play in modern Australian agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA>The proposed sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system is an important part of both the government's asset sales program and the government's micro-economic reform agenda. The government's first attempt to sell the pipeline was halted in December 1990 when the Senate rejected legislation to commercialise haulage tariffs. At that time, the government announced that it would not sell the pipeline unless it could do so on a commercial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, the government reaffirmed its intention to sell the pipeline on the basis of a negotiated conditional sale of a 51 per cent stake to AGL&mdash;the Australian Gas Light Co.&mdash;and a competitive tender for the remaining 49 per cent. In so doing, it has had regard to the fact that AGL holds a first right of refusal to acquire the pipeline, against both the Pipeline Authority and the Commonwealth, confirmed by the New South Wales Supreme Court in late 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement with AGL specified a range of conditions precedent, including that the Commonwealth would not proceed with the sale unless there was a successful completion of the competitive tender for the non-AGL stake. Other key requirements are that buyers of the pipeline enter into a new commercial gas haulage agreement with AGL and an agreement governing the use of, and access to, the pipeline easements; and that there be resolution of the rights held by the Cooper Basin Gas Producers, appropriate approvals from the Trade Practices Commission, and authorisation by the New South Wales Gas Council of the new gas haulage agreement. It is also necessary to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for the operation of the privately owned pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of this bill is to institute the necessary arrangements to complete the sale by facilitating the transfer of specified assets and liabilities, other than debt, of the Pipeline Authority. It also provides for continuing employment of those staff who accept employment offers from the purchasers, and preserves their accumulated benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pipeline transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin gas fields in South Australia to Sydney, regional centres in New South Wales, and the ACT. It comprises approximately 1,300 kilometres of trunkline from Moomba in South Australia to Wilton on the outskirts of Sydney. The trunkline includes two compressor stations at Bulla Park, west of Cobar, and at Young in New South Wales. It also includes pipelines from Young to Wagga Wagga, Young to Lithgow, Junee to Griffith and Dalton to Canberra, and spur pipelines to Cootamundra, Oberon, Junee, Orange and Bathurst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pipeline is currently owned and operated by the Pipeline Authority, a Commonwealth statutory authority established by the Pipeline Authority Act 1973.

The pipeline was constructed in the period 1974-76 after the authority took over the project from AGL. In 1974,  the authority entered into an agreement with AGL to carry, on a cost recovery basis, the gas which AGL had contracted to buy from the Cooper Basin producers over the 30-year period to 2006. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labyrinth of existing contractual arrangements accords AGL extensive rights, which will be relinquished in the context of the pipeline sale transaction. These existing rights include a guarantee by the Commonwealth of the authority's performance in hauling gas, absolute priority to the existing and future capacity of the pipeline until at least 2006, haulage of gas on a cost-recovery basis until 2006, a right of first refusal to acquire the pipeline and a right of veto over any sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a part of the sale, AGL would enter into a new agreement with the privatised pipeline company for the haulage of gas&mdash;to be known as the gas transportation agreement&mdash;thereby providing clear structural separation and transparency of the pipeline's operations from those of AGL. This agreement would involve commercial haulage tariffs and facilitate arrangements for third-party access to the pipeline. In return for releasing the Commonwealth and the Pipeline Authority from existing contractual commitments, AGL will receive compensation of $30 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Cooper Basin producers also have a number of rights, arising out of the deed of covenant and consent, which have been in existence since 1974. These include a veto over any sale of the pipeline and a range of rights in respect of haulage of gas which have not been utilised over the past two decades other than priority of carriage of the gas sold to AGL. The government is seeking the agreement of the producers to an appropriate resolution of these rights prior to the sale of the pipeline. The government has further recently requested advice from the producers that they will not exercise their rights of veto over this sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the producers' interests, apart from any ongoing rights of veto over the future disposition of the pipeline, can be adequately safeguarded in the context of the proposed sale. This will be achieved through appropriate regulatory arrangements, which are to be addressed in amendments to this bill, and the proposed new gas transportation agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is noted that the proposed regulatory arrangements, whilst protecting the take-or-pay component of the existing gas supply contract between AGL and the Cooper Basin producers, would enable the Trade Practices Commission in the future to make a determination for access to the pipeline system which might prevent non-take-or-pay contracted volumes being supplied by the producers to AGL. This would occur only in circumstances in which gas volumes hauled down the pipeline increased substantially over present volumes and where consumers are getting gas from suppliers other than AGL, possibly sourced from the same producers. Given the protections contained in the legislation, this is very unlikely to occur. In addition, there is a mechanism for ensuring that additional capacity can be added to the pipeline, potentially to double its existing capacity.  However, in the unlikely event that any loss is suffered by the producers, the bill also provides a mechanism for the producers to seek compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the veto over the sale which is currently proposed, it is recognised that the producers will have an interest in the ongoing ownership structure of the new pipeline company in respect of the performance of its obligations under the new gas transportation agreement. However, the original arrangement for the establishment of the pipeline, dating back to 1971, before the Commonwealth assumed a role, involved AGL and the producers agreeing that AGL would own the pipeline, with no rights of the producers to veto a future sale by AGL. The proposed ownership structure under which AGL will now have a controlling interest in the new pipeline company mirrors the original situation. The government has undertaken to provide the producers with details of the proposed ownership structure of the new pipeline company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that any ongoing veto right over subsequent changes in the pipeline's ownership could not continue post-sale, as its existence would be inconsistent with the reinstatement of AGL's earlier proposed position as controlling owner of the pipeline. In any case, such a veto would significantly constrain the new pipeline company and its shareholders in such a way that it would be unlikely that the sale now proposed could proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's objective is to reach a negotiated outcome with the producers in relation to all their rights, including the veto rights. However, should that not be possible, the bill would permit the government to pursue other options. These include transferring to the new pipeline company the obligation to satisfy these rights, except the veto rights, or the alternative of extinguishing the rights. If the rights are extinguished, the legislation provides a mechanism for the producers to be compensated on `just terms' should they suffer a loss. The government will determine which of these options is appropriate in the light of progress in resolving the matters by negotiation. However, as I have said, the government's objective is to achieve a negotiated settlement with the producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the sale agreement with AGL was concluded in mid-November 1993, it was anticipated that passage of the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill would have instituted the regulatory framework within which the new owner of the pipeline would operate, following completion of the sale in June 1994. However, as part of the agreement reached by the Council of Australian Governments on 25 February 1994, the government deferred the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill in favour of the development by mid-1996 of a comprehensive package of competitive measures for the gas industry. Therefore, in order to conclude the sale prior to development of this package, it will be necessary to have in place regulatory arrangements which will specifically govern the pipeline's operations under private ownership. I intend to introduce an amendment to the bill to address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate the sale, the government proposes to create a new Commonwealth trading company which will not trade until the date of the sale, illustratively called `Newco' for the purposes of the bill. The Commonwealth will sell shares in the company for a nominal amount to AGL and to the 49 per cent purchasers. Thereafter, the Commonwealth would execute an asset purchase agreement with Newco under which, among other things, assets and certain liabilities, except debt, would be transferred to Newco in exchange for the purchase consideration, which is expected to be in the order of $510 to $550 million. The bill provides that on sale day certain Pipeline Authority staff, who have accepted an offer of employment with Newco, would transfer into this new company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the execution of the asset purchase agreement, Newco would enter into the new gas transportation agreement with AGL and into an easement agreement with the Commonwealth relating to the joint ownership of certain easements by the Commonwealth and Newco. The easement agreement will limit Newco's rights to the use of the easements only for the operation and maintenance of the pipeline. Newco will not be able to prohibit the building and operation of other pipelines on the same route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill now before the House contains a range of legislative measures required to effect the sale of the pipeline system on this basis. The sale has attracted a good deal of international and domestic interest. Short-listed competitive bidders were invited to undertake due diligence and have participated in a program of site visits and presentations by the management of the authority, and relevant Commonwealth and state agencies. Final bids for the non-AGL 49 per cent stake are due on 20 May 1994, following which the government will consider the final sale package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the Commonwealth to assume the debt obligations of the authority to meet the authority's private debt commitments and to discharge its public debt, and reflects transactions necessary for this assumption of debt to be properly recorded in the Commonwealth's accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this connection, it should be noted that since its establishment in 1973 the operations of the Pipeline Authority have been underwritten by debt financing. Construction of the Moomba to Sydney trunk pipeline from 1974 to 1976 was funded by loans from the budget. Since that time, the authority's operations, including the construction of lateral pipelines, have been funded by public and private borrowings in addition to revenue earned from the haulage of gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assumption of the debt is necessary to avoid complications which might otherwise make the pipeline difficult to market and to avoid any Commonwealth involvement with the business after the sale. At 30 June 1994, the Pipeline Authority is expected to have about $191 million in debt on its balance sheet. This is expected to comprise about $130 million of Commonwealth-guaranteed privately held inscribed stock and bank loans and outstanding Commonwealth loans of approximately $61 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the prospective owners of Newco to make offers of employment to authority staff, which will apply from sale day. Offers would be made on the basis of terms and conditions of employment that are broadly equivalent to those which currently apply to employment with the authority. Staff accepting such offers would transfer to Newco with continuity of service preserved and full protection of rights accrued under Commonwealth employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the bill provides for a number of `transitional and saving provisions' in respect of a variety of Commonwealth legislation, such as the Long Service Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1976 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. These provisions will ensure, in particular, that employees of the Pipeline Authority do not lose the benefits that they will have accrued prior to the sale of the pipeline. They are similar to the provisions provided in the Qantas, CSL and SMEC sale legislation and ensure fair and consistent treatment of government employees regardless of the method of sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staff who do not receive an offer of employment from Newco, and those who reject an offer which is not broadly equivalent to their existing terms and conditions of employment, would be eligible for redundancy benefits. Those who reject an offer which is judged to be broadly equivalent would be deemed to have resigned and therefore would not be eligible for redundancy benefits. Administrative arrangements for assessing whether an employment offer is broadly equivalent will be embodied in a `staff transfer agreement' to be made between the prospective purchasers of Newco, the unions representing staff and the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various transactions associated with the arrangements for sale of the pipeline may attract liability for stamp duties. In the absence of other action, this would depress the expected returns to all taxpayers throughout Australia from the sale of the pipeline, and benefit taxpayers in a particular state only. As with other asset sales, to avoid these difficulties transactions relating to the pipeline sale are to be exempt from stamp duties. The bill also makes quite clear that the new company which is to own and operate the pipeline will not have any immunity post-sale from duties legitimately imposed. The bill as introduced does not address the role of the Pipeline Authority post-sale. I propose to introduce an amendment to this bill to address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to institute a sound legislative framework for the sale of specified assets and liabilities of the Pipeline Authority. It is a key element in assisting the government to achieve its objectives for the sale. Instituting the framework will enable the government to resolve once and for all the inherent uncertainty and ambiguity of the present contractual arrangements between the authority and AGL. In instituting arrangements which will promote competition in access to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system, a key element of the nation's gas infrastructure, the government is demonstrating its commitment to micro-economic reform of the gas industry in Australia. At the same time the government will achieve a fair value in divesting an asset for which public ownership is no longer appropriate. I commend the bill to the House, and I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say at the outset that I am less than impressed with the fact that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), without any consultation with me as the shadow minister carrying this legislation, changed the timing of the debate to the effect that the amount of time given to examine the necessary papers, which were brought to me late afternoon the day before yesterday&mdash;47 pages of amendments to this act&mdash;was not satisfactory. I think it is fair to say that it is hopefully the last chapter in what is no less than five years of totally unsatisfactory handling by the government of this entire situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Moomba-Sydney pipeline system transports natural gas from the Cooper Basin gas fields in South Australia to Sydney, regional New South Wales and the ACT. The system is currently owned and operated by the Pipeline Authority, a Commonwealth statutory authority. The Australian Gaslight Co., known as AGL, was originally going to build a Moomba-Sydney pipeline in the early 1970s. But the program was nationalised by the Whitlam government, by its very keen minister, the then Minister for Minerals and Energy, Rex Connor, who had a great dream for a pipeline system across Australia controlled by the Commonwealth. By deciding to sell the Pipeline Authority, the government has in effect now come full circle. It wants to make at least a gesture at privatising a pipeline which should never have been owned by the government in the first place. In doing so, that has created a whole range of major difficulties from the point of view of unscrambling this unfortunate egg because of the commitments made by Mr Connor back in the early 1970s. I must say I have some feelings of compassion for the members of the bureaucracy who have been involved in this very difficult and protracted period of negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties have advocated privatising the Pipeline Authority, and by extension the pipeline, since as early as 1985. We were criticised for this by the government over many years, but in the budget of 1989-90 it finally announced the sale of the Pipeline Authority. The Moomba-Sydney gas pipeline was withdrawn from sale in 1991 following the opposition's refusal to support moves to allow the Pipeline Authority to change the commercial tariffs on the transportation of gas, which would have breached the government's contractual arrangements then in place with AGL. Following the resolution of legal issues arising from AGL's entitlements, in which the government was humiliated by the High Court, which rejected an application for special leave to appeal to it, privatisation of the Pipeline Authority was reactivat ed in the 1992-93 budget. In the meantime I should add that the legal rights of AGL were fully supported by the courts. In other words, AGL had the right of first refusal. They and they alone were the people who initially would be able to control a major amount of the pipeline in the event that it was privatised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 November 1993 the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Resources announced that 51 per cent of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline would be sold to AGL on the following conditions: firstly, the Commonwealth achieving a satisfactory price for the remaining 49 per cent being sold by tender; secondly, a new agreement being executed for haulage of gas to Sydney and regional New South Wales; and, thirdly, the Trade Practices Commission approving competitive arrangements in the ownership structure. I might observe that it took the government at least four years to admit that it ought to sell the Pipeline Authority in the first place. It then took another three years while the government tried to breach its contract with AGL. It has now taken a further two years for the government to bring this sale, one hopes, close to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the five years since the government announced the sale of the Pipeline Authority, its essential motivation for selling this asset has been simply one thing&mdash;money. That is why it tried so hard to breach its contract with AGL in the first place. Its reason for wanting to sell the Pipeline Authority was not to introduce greater competition and not to benefit gas consumers, which is the primary responsibility of government, but to grab the proceeds of sale to fund its recurrent expenditure programs. We saw a demonstration of that in the budget on Tuesday night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth having this historical perspective because, despite having been advised by the opposition to sell the Pipeline Authority for at least the last nine years, despite having had five years to sell it and despite reactivating the sale in 1992, the government has come into this House expecting the parliament to agree to legislation which is still not finalised and which aims to sell the Pipeline Authority by 30 June. As I have already stated, the day before yesterday I was given 47 additional pages of amendments. I suspect, as the minister has already told us, there will be further amendments to amendments both here and in the Senate in due course. Quite clearly, that is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the government's motivation is money. It wants to include the revenue from the pipeline sale, estimated at between $510 million and $550 million gross, as income for the current financial year, thereby being seen to achieve its target of $2.4 billion in asset sales for 1993-94. The opposition remains totally committed to the sale of the Pipeline Authority and will give this bill passage through the House of Representatives today, although I fully expect we will see it back here again after it has been to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since having been introduced on 24 March, six weeks ago, the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill 1994 has undergone so many changes that I have lost count of them. As the scramble to complete this sale before 30 June has intensified, it has been changing literally daily, if not hourly, and no doubt it will change yet again. Moreover, the parliament had not formally seen the bulk of this legislation until the government tabled the amendments during the debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself establishes the framework necessary for the sale of the Pipeline Authority's assets and liabilities, other than debt, by creating a new pipeline company called Newco. The government has negotiated a conditional sale agreement with the Australian Gas Light Co., the pipeline's sole customer, to purchase 51 per cent of Newco, while the remaining 49 per cent will be sold by competitive tender to domestic and foreign buyers. The government has set a date, 27 May, by which to finalise the determination of who those buyers will be. In other words, at this stage, we are negotiating a bill without knowing precisely what the formula will be in terms of the composition of the owners of Newco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill deals with procedural aspects of the sale, including the transfer of assets and liabilities, other than debt; the future of the Pipeline Authority's staff; and the control of the easements. Matters such as carrier rates for third-party access, pricing of gas post-sale and other regulatory provisions relating to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline system are included in these new amendments. Further amendments may be necessary, as final negotiations and approvals have not been completed with the gas producers, state governments and the potential minority purchasers or, for that matter, to the final satisfaction of the TPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a precursor to the passage of the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill, parliament recently passed the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill 1993, which required interstate gas pipeline operators to make spare capacity available to those requesting its use and to give the TPC power to arbitrate on disputes. Essentially, this undermined the monopoly ownership of gas pipelines by allowing third parties access, thus allowing key industrial users to negotiate supply from alternatives to the company operating the pipeline. That is the broad outline of the bill and its context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still several major unresolved issues in relation to this sale. A number of contentious issues have been raised by parties to the sale, including the Moomba gas producers, AGL, potential minority shareholders and the Gas Council of New South Wales. Above all, one has to see this proposal in the context of the national competition policy report tabled in this House and written by Professor Hilmer and also the outcome of the Council of Australian Governments meeting which was held in Hobart on 25 February of this year. Attachment B to the COAG report</PARA>
<PARA>quite clearly set out the conditions which the council believes should be the basis of such a trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the concentration of ownership. The Commonwealth is offering AGL majority control without any apparent qualifications. This bill effectively contains nothing to prevent AGL from buying 100 per cent of Newco and then selling down to 49 per cent, subject presumably to the requirements of the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that AGL could also increase its shareholding in the future to include the remaining 49 per cent. The effect that this may have on any other gas interest, including producers, is not clear, but it would most certainly conflict with the TPC's policy on vertical monopolies. At the same time, however, it can equally be argued that should, for example, one of the existing gas producers such as Santos be one of the buyers into the pipeline at a 49 per cent minority interest, that effectively could also give the producer a degree of monopoly involvement which, again, would perhaps attract the attention of the TPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the sale process for the 49 per cent stake in Newco is still under way, though the government has extended the closing date&mdash;originally 2 May&mdash;to 20 May, with the asset sales task force having undertaken to select the preferred bidder, as I stated earlier, by 27 May.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government then hopes to take the sale legislation through the Senate in the week commencing 30 May and to execute conditional agreements on 10 June to take effect on 30 June. I think it is fair to say it is a somewhat ambitious timetable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the question of Newco. The nature of the proposed entity which will own and operate the pipeline has not been specified in some key respects. Up until two days ago the government was insisting on a company structure with a majority and minority shareholdings, whereas the potential 49 per cent minority shareholders&mdash;known in the trade as the forty-niners&mdash;such as Santos, the Victorian Gas and Fuel Corporation and also a number of foreign participants, are more interested in seeking a joint venture structure. This would give the forty-niners, as I am informed, taxation and cash flow advantages, particularly for overseas bidders who have little use for Australian franked dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two days&mdash;in the middle of the tender for the 49 per cent of Newco&mdash;the government has shown signs of yielding, indicating that this bill does not proscribe a joint venture, which could be built around the corporate model. However, I am unaware of whether the government has formally advised tenderers of this&mdash;certainly it has not advised at least one of the tenderers. Neither am I as confident as the asset sales task force is that a joint venture structure will not require further amendments to the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a legal opinion by Dawson and Waldron which suggests there will be a need for amendments and which emphasises some of the difficulties which remain. On the most simplistic level, the bill as it currently stands is written in the singular. In other words, it refers to Newco as a single entity. By definition, if there is going to be a different structure involving joint venturers, obviously the legislation will have to be changed to cover the plurality of interests in that particular respect or at least have some indication of where the difference lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is so, it is one more instance where the government's policy making on the run has been to the detriment of the quality of this legislation. The Minister for Finance should make a statement to the effect that joint venture arrangements are possible, advise potential bidders to that effect and give a commitment to amend this bill should any amendments be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless there is a very good reason, company structures available to any other consortium in Australia should also be available to the parties involved in the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, particularly as this may result in higher bids for the 49 per cent of Newco, which obviously is in the public interest. However, if Newco were to be a joint venture, the regulator would need to be satisfied that the agreement was not anti-competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the question of the producers' veto. Part of the pipeline sales agreement provides for a $30 million payment to AGL for forgoing contractual rights under the existing pipeline system B. However, there are six Cooper Basin producers&mdash;Santos, Sagasco, Cultus, Crusader, Delhi and Bridge. Their interests in terms of the amount of gas they put through the pipeline range from 60 per cent in the case of Santos to one per cent in the case of Cultus. So you can see that there is a very wide range of potentially conflicting interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also have rights evolving from a tripartite agreement called the Deed of Covenant and Consent which the producers entered into with AGL and the Pipeline Authority when Rex Connor nationalised the project back in 1974.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubting the fact that these rights are there in law whether they have been exercised in the past or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the right to have the pipeline constructed and completed, and obviously that is past tense. There is the right to have the gas that AGL purchases from the producers carried through as a priority, and that remains the situation and has been endorsed by this legislation. There is the right to have natural gas carried through the pipeline on their own account and LPG carried through the pipeline to a processing plant, and that has also been endorsed by this legislation. There is the right to have their gas carried through the pipeline on terms no greater than for any other third party and there is also the right of first refusal to supply AGL's additional sales requirements. Finally, and most significantly, there is the right of veto over any sale of the pipeline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that last point, that last right, settlement has not yet been achieved because the owners of these rights, namely the producers, naturally take the view that, if AGL is bought out of its rights, what is the Commonwealth going to do to buy them out of their rights. This is a question of contractual obligation, it is a question of corporate law&mdash;it is not a matter which we can determine in this parliament. I simply flag the fact that this issue has not yet been settled in the context of this legislation. In other words, these rights are there and it is a question of how they are disposed of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation before the House, the government is taking a very simple approach. It is simply saying that these rights&mdash;particularly the last one, the right of veto for the sale of the pipeline&mdash;do not apply because some of these other rights have never been exercised by their owners, by the six producers. In other words, they are saying in clause 29 of this bill that the parliament should effectively abrogate and negate those rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of some concern to me and to the opposition that the parliament should, of its own volition, neutralise or remove the rights established in a normal legal structure that is set out in accordance with a previous agreement. They are very important questions which need to be determined. That is one of the reasons why I am moving an amendment to this legislation suggesting that if these matters are not solved by 20 May there really is no alternative but to consider referring them to a Senate committee for further examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that the Moomba-Sydney Pipeline System Sale Bill adequately addresses all outstanding rights. It argues that this legislation does not affect a 1971 letter of agreement between AGL and the producers which obliges AGL to buy 100 to 105 per cent&mdash;I do not quite know how you buy 105 per cent of anything; nevertheless that is what it says&mdash;of the producer's gas under schedule A and that the gas transportation agreement between Newco and the producers is written so as to permit haulage of schedule A volumes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the government argues that the bill's open access provisions protect the producers' right to have their gas hauled at non-discriminatory prices and that the regulatory agreement specifically precludes the TPC from interfering in AGL's obligation to buy gas from producers. This brings us to the producers' right of veto over any sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that if the producers will not agree to give up their rights of veto they will proceed, as I stated earlier, with the passage of this legislation to extinguish those rights. The government has tried to address the producers' concerns by inserting a provision in the bill, clause 30, which will allow them to have recourse to just terms. In other words, the producers will be able to sue the Commonwealth should they be able to demonstrate a case for compensation to the courts. The Commonwealth believes that since there has been no exercising of some of these rights it follows that there is no financial value that you can put against them. That again, as I said, is something which should be determined by the courts and not by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the producers are concerned, Santos and other gas providers are claiming compensation for their loss of rights under the deed of covenant and consent. This has been rejected by the government and may result in further litigation. The producers are concerned that negotiations with the government over their rights are still continuing and have still not, as I understand it, been resolved. Unless they are satisfied with the outcome of negotiations&mdash;and the matter is complicated by the fact that each of the six has a right of veto&mdash;they have threatened legal action. This is the question which is on the agenda and will have to be looked at by the government and, no doubt, by the Senate in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to regulatory arrangements. Another unresolved issue concerns the regulatory arrangements to apply to the pipeline after sale. At present, all other pipelines are regulated by the states and territories concerned. Even though the regulatory arrangements covering post-sale operations of pipelines have been specified in government amendments introduced today, there is the question of whether this regime will be consistent with the final COAG proposals  establishing the regulatory principles for a national pipeline regime which is to be negotiated by July 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the point of view of the opposition, the existence of two pipeline regimes&mdash;the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and other pipelines&mdash;is not a satisfactory situation. The government states that the regulations under this bill will stand regardless of the outcome of COAG. That is what it has told the New South Wales government. That is the essence of our concern. That is why one of the amendments we are moving today will be to the effect that this legislation, if and when it is passed, should be subject to review by the appropriate minister when a final settlement is reached with the states under COAG for the renegotiation of pipeline ownership and pipeline administration arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no case, in terms of the principles of Hilmer on the one hand or the principles of the COAG negotiation on the other, which would justify two sets of rules governing pipelines in this country. As someone said to me the other day, and it is quite appropriate, ultimately the objective should be to have a supply of gas across the continent to a whole range of markets in an open and free way so there is total competition. This would mean that ultimately when Australia runs out of gas we would run out of gas in every tap in every part of the nation more or less at the same time. That should be the objective, not to have a rise and fall arrangement by which there are some winners and some losers, depending upon which state people happen to be in at a particular time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that the regulatory regime applying to the pipeline must overcome unique concerns. It must honour the contractual ramifications of AGL's first right of refusal&mdash;and that it does&mdash;as well as the Trade Practices Commission's concerns about these arrangements with AGL breaching section 50 of the Trade Practices Act, which relates to transparency and separation of management and accounts. The government is thus arguing that the regulatory regime attached to this bill marries these conflicting concerns and will not become a model for future regimes. I remain very sceptical about that. I have a horrible suspicion that the ghost of Rex Connor is probably looking down at us at this very moment and saying that, although this bill effectively means the privatisation of his dream, in terms of the regulatory regime, the model that the government is putting in place for the Moomba-Sydney pipeline will be precisely the same regulatory regime which it would like to see applied across the Commonwealth and which will perhaps be the outcome of the COAG negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated before, I hope that is not so. I hope the states will have a free and fair input in this arrangement, because the regulation of the pipelines in this country is exclusively the responsibility of the states. The Commonwealth really comes into it only in the context of the trade between the states over borders, where of course pipelines have a tendency to go. We will be watching this COAG issue very carefully. The linkage between gas production, electricity production and the transfer of water is absolutely fundamental to the long-term development of the resources of this nation, and we must ensure that those resources are adequately available to all on the basis of a free and fair, open competitive system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that the TPC, AGL and the states have now `ticked off', to use their expression, on these most important issues. I am informed that final approval of the legislation by the state governments, in keeping with the COAG process, is still to be finalised. It is especially important that we have the approval of the New South Wales government because, after all, the pipeline primarily supplies New South Wales markets. They are markets which are totally dependent on this pipeline. There are at this stage no competitive forces in play. There is some talk about ESSO-BHP putting a pipeline up from Victoria. If that should be the case, in two or three years time there will be a competitive pipeline carrying competitive gas to, hopefully, an open market situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the fact that there will be access to third parties is very important because the ESSO-BHP line may well tap in either west of the point where the New South Wales regulator starts at Wilton and the Commonwealth administration ends, or else it will tap in at some other point near Sydney. But either way there has to be a clear understanding as to the responsibilities of the various parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that the Commonwealth has not yet reached agreement with the New South Wales Gas Council on the regulatory framework to apply to the pipeline after sale. In view of the recent COAG agreement to create a cooperative regulatory environment by 1996, it should be asked why the Moomba-Sydney pipeline is to be treated differently. The regulatory regime to apply to the Moomba-Sydney pipeline or, at least, that part west of Wilton, which the parliament is only seeing for the first time today, and its consistency with the COAG principles, the Hilmer principles, and any future COAG regime, is clearly a matter which must be examined closely over the coming weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final concern is that the sale, in whatever form it finally emerges, is fair to all parties&mdash;the producers, AGL, the forty-niners and, above all, consumers. Parliament should be satisfied that the purchase price for the assets of the Pipeline Authority is fair and not exclusive, and that the haulage agreement following the sale is equitable to all parties and does not disadvantage gas consumers. In announcing the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline in November 1993, the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Resources said that, on the basis of discussions with AGL, the sale will result in no increase in final gas prices paid by consumers in New South Wales and the ACT, with potential price falls flowing to major users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales gas market has two main components: the contract and the tariff markets. The government maintains that the contract with AGL contains the right pricing signals and that the gas transportation agreement winds back haulage tariffs, which will lead to price reductions. Against this, the New South Wales Gas Council contends that, under the new agreement, short-term haulage charges for gas will rise because the new haulage price will reflect a commercial rate of return, as opposed to the old agreement which was based on cost recovery only. AGL wants the right to vary prices between consumers, but claims that the overall price will remain the same. The Gas Council believes that the outcome of the new formula will be that monopoly profits are enjoyed by the new owners while they remain the sole supplier of gas. One can take that to mean `until a new pipeline is built or a third party is brought into the existing system which can compete on open markets' because, at this stage, for all intents and purposes AGL does have monopoly interests, especially in the Sydney basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the TPC, the present price structure for gas is based on peak demand in mid-winter, and presently demand is measured on peak load. On this basis, no additional contracts could be signed. The TPC believes a different price structure could apply to a non-peak period because of the potential for haulage of high volumes. However, debate is still continuing on how the price should be calculated. I believe that parliament should examine this issue most carefully because, fundamentally, our objective must be not only to ensure open markets but also to ensure that the consumer has the best possible price available. In the final analysis, the exercise of privatising the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, which at present has a monopoly on the sale of gas to New South Wales, will be unsuccessful unless we can demonstrate that there is a clear benefit to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The target date of 30 June set by the Commonwealth for the sale of the Pipeline Authority assumes the conclusion of negotiations with New South Wales and other states on a regulatory framework for the pipeline system. By trying to pass the bill into law before the conclusion of negotiations, the government is presenting all those parties, as well as the bidders for the remaining 49 per cent and the Cooper Basin gas producers, with a fait accompli. The opposition supports the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and, as I have said, will give the bill its passage through the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is gravely concerned that, as a result of the government's incompetence, the parliament is being asked to endorse a process which is incomplete, the outcome of which is still unknown.

Only spending endless hours trying to grasp the technicalities and complexities and the public policy considerations can give even a working knowledge of the legislation. This legislation and the process preceding it are a disgrace. This parliament is being regarded by the government purely as a rubber stamp. There is not a single member, bar three, who knows basically what is going on, and yet this parliament is going to have to take the government on faith and pass the legislation. That is not good enough, as far as the opposition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can it be acceptable, even to government members, when 42 pages of amendments lobbed on our desks just yesterday and many of the amendments are major and fundamentally alter the legislation?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the government has had five years to get it right. Five years ago it announced the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline and now there is a mad panic because a 20 May deadline has to be met, by which time the preferred bidder will have been chosen individually or collectively for the remaining 49 per cent share of the pipeline sale, it having been agreed that the other 51 per cent be sold to Australian Gaslight Co., AGL. So there is an unprecedented degree of frenetic energy within the bureaucracy and now within the parliament because the government has left it to the very last moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody knows that the sale of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline was never going to be an easy matter to settle in legislative form. There are whole numbers of parties directly involved and a number of competing interests that have to be satisfied. So why the government and the respective departments could not have done so much more in preparation for the proper consideration by the parliament, I do not know. I would like the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) to explain why his direct responsibility has been abandoned in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a transparent process that the parliament is considering. How many honourable members are going to work their way through the 42 pages of amendments? The answer is quite obvious: next to none&mdash;because they have neither the time nor the technical knowledge for it. I cannot for the life of me believe that government members&mdash;let alone opposition members&mdash;are happy with the minister's handling of this issue, and certainly not with the form in which the legislation is now being considered by the federal parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We told the government to sell the Sydney-Moomba pipeline as long as 10 years ago. When the government did make the decision five years ago, it quickly got caught up in a legal imbroglio entirely of its own making, because it sought to renege of its contractual obligations to AGL. Even if one is charitable and allows for the fact that there was a High Court contest and a decision to be delivered in regard to the government's contractual relationship with AGL, two years have passed since those matters were clarified by the High Court. Why, 24 hours before the debate, do we get 42 pages of amendments, when the government has had this sale in process for two years? There is simply no excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who has any commitment to the importance of this place must reject the government's handling of this matter. If this parliament is to hold executive government accountable, quite frankly, it must condemn the government for its handling of the whole issue. It is a complete disgrace. It brings no credit to the minister responsible, and certainly not to those he charged in his department with the responsibility. It is not correct, as the minister would have us believe, that all parties with an interest in this matter are satisfied. In any event, how are we to know? The minister tells us many different things in the second reading speech, but we are not able to sign off on that as easily as he would wish. The minister's handling of this matter reeks, at the very best, of complacency and, at the very worst, of contempt for the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline has its genesis some 20 or more years ago. If my memory serves me correctly, this issue and an associated bill formed part of the double dissolution package of 1973. Around that time, AGL decided to build a pipeline from Moomba, to supply gas to Sydney. Rex Connor was the Minister for Mines and Resources in the Whitlam government, and he decided to step in and stop a private sector company building a pipeline. This was clearly, in his view and that of the Whitlam government, all too important an undertaking to leave to the private sector, so the Labor government of the time decided to build and operate the pipeline for the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite fascinating to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the debate of 16 May 1973. Rather than take the House down memory lane, I simply refer honourable members to the summing up of the debate by Mr Connor, as Minister for Minerals and Energy. In that debate, honourable members will get all the tub-thumping phoney nationalism for which he and the Whitlam government were so well known. The opposition, the then Liberal-National Party coalition, supported the establishment of a natural gas pipeline, but believed it had to be done by the private sector. I do not think it is overstating the case to claim that this would be the present Labor government's position. But this was not good enough for the Whitlam government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us leave aside all of the rhetoric and phoneyness of Rex Connor's feigned patriotism&mdash;I say that because he reserves unto himself this concern about the best interests of the people of Australia and pours scorn on the then opposition for not having the same commitment to patriotism as he had. In any event, let us go to one particular point where he seeks to reassure AGL that its interests will be protected, despite the fact that he intends to nationalise the pipeline. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for fair treatment, the Australian Gas Light Co. is getting it and getting it to the letter.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to handling the matter expeditiously, we will do it strictly in accordance with our undertakings. The Government of Australia has never welshed on a contract, and that goes for the Labor Government, too.</PARA>
<PARA>This Labor government certainly sought to welsh on a contract with AGL, because in 1990 it sought to overturn the commercial arrangements that AGL enjoyed under a legally binding contract with the Commonwealth government. That agreement of longstanding between the Commonwealth and AGL gave AGL the first right of refusal should the Commonwealth decide to sell the pipeline. The Commonwealth also tried to increase gas haulage prices on the pipeline and use the increased haulage prices to inflate the asset price of the pipeline which it would then sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of taking a commonsense approach and accepting the validity of that binding contract at face value, the Commonwealth tried to overturn it in the courts; it tried to welsh on a contract with a company in the private sector. Interestingly enough, when the Labor Caucus did decide to sell the pipeline in 1990, the vote was only 43 to 39 in favour of going ahead. Two votes the other way and there would have been a tie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proteges of Rex Connor obviously could not bear to see the pipeline in private hands. In the division which followed the debate on 16 May 1973, which was naturally won by the government with 61 ayes to 54 noes, there appear counted amongst the ayes the names of P. J. Keating and R. Willis&mdash;now the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Perhaps there has been a late conversion and new appreciation on their part of the importance of infrastructure such as this being built by the private sector and not being unilaterally nationalised. However, at that time, they were as ignorant as the then minister for minerals and energy was and they are therefore as responsible as he was for the mess that we are now trying to deal with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House understand the importance of the private sector to building growth in the economy. I do not think that the legacy of Rex Connor has ever left the Labor Party. His followers are alive and well on the other side. Why else would the government be tied up in knots with its privatisation plans for the Federal Airports Corporation at the biennial Labor conference in September? The government cannot be certain that it can embark on any sensible and rational privatisation program because of the troglodytes which generally inhabit the Labor Left and will collectively exert their influence at the September conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the government's house of cards collapsed in 1992 because the High Court upheld the original agreement giving AGL first right of refusal, the government adopted a new tack. The government was going to unilaterally regulate interstate gas transmission through the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill. That bill, which was tabled in the Senate late last year, has now been withdrawn on the basis that it is utterly unworkable and with a frank admission by the government that insufficient consultation took place before its drafting. So its approach to the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill was unworkable as well. Meanwhile overseas and Australian investors were placing the Moomba-Sydney pipeline on the list of the Labor government's inspired resource disasters. The pipeline debacle must rank somewhere between Coronation Hill and Mabo. As a result, the government was forced to step down from its pedestal and start talking to the states and AGL. If the momentum for reform is maintained, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, should be able to provide genuine agreement between the states and the Commonwealth on freeing up interstate gas transmission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, it began to listen to the points of view of the parties who have an abiding and continual involvement in the Moomba-Sydney pipeline. The other strand of the government's supposedly new, pragmatic approach is the legislation before the House. I would go so far as to say that I welcome any reasonable measure that will finally get the Moomba-Sydney pipeline into the private sector where it belongs, and as soon as possible. But there are outstanding issues which the government has still not concluded. For instance, the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, APEA, the peak body of the petroleum industry sector, has drawn attention to serious defects in the bill. APEA is concerned that clauses 29 and 30 of the original bill diminish the right of the Cooper Basin gas producers in South Australia. This arises because there is an agreement between the producers, AGL and the Pipeline Authority which provides that the ownership or control of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline will not be transferred without the prior written consent of the producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the influence of Rex Connor still lives on. APEA is concerned that the Australian government undertook and guaranteed the performance by the Pipeline Authority of the covenants and obligations under that agreement. APEA states that, except in the most compelling circumstances, the Australian government must honour its contractual commitments and that this bill may set a disturbing precedent in seeking to overturn a commercial contract. Of course, this is exactly the same problem as the coalition had with the government's attempt to sell the pipeline in 1990. The government was then trying to overturn an agreement that came out of Rex Connor's nationalisation of the pipeline. The coalition, ultimately the parliament and certainly the High Court would not stand for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must resolve this issue, particularly if it is to meet the self-imposed deadline of completing the sale by 30 June this year. Although I understand that the Trade Practices Commission and AGL have reached agreement on issues relevant to the TPC, I remain concerned about the role of the TPC in this sale. My concern is that the Trade Practices Commission may become a de facto regulator of the gas industry as a result of its involvement in this sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may recall the recent celebrated case between the Trade Practices Commission, the natural gas producer Santos and the then South Australian government owned gas utility Sagasco Holdings.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a clear responsibility to AGL in particular and other parties such as producers and consumers who have a legitimate, if not legal, interest in the Moomba-Sydney pipeline sale.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be wrong to suggest that the current regime under which the pipeline operates and transports gas for its single customer, AGL, should never be reviewed or altered. There are a number of apparent problems associated with the current arrangements. The 1974 haulage agreement between the Pipeline Authority and AGL, as amended by the 1985 heads of agreement, provides only for cost recovery and not for a commercial rate of return on the current value of the Pipeline Authority's assets. If such arrangements were left unchanged, the subsidy from the authority to AGL could continue indefinitely, to the benefit of AGL shareholders and at the expense of the authority and Australian taxpayers. They would also reduce the expected sale price of the pipeline, as proposed by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced its intention to sell the Moomba to Sydney gas pipeline in the 1992 budget, as part of its major policy drive, with the stated aim of facilitating natural gas as a national market driven industry.

The bill proposes a framework for this by establishing a new pipeline company, Newco, which would have the assets and liabilities&mdash;except for the debt&mdash;of the authority and an authority subsidiary transferred to it. On the date of the sale the government would sell its shares in Newco to AGL and the 49 per cent purchasers. Newco would pay the purchase price for the assets and liabilities, except the debt, of the authority to the government. Like most asset sales, it seems the private purchaser will pick up the profit and the public will pick up the debt. </PARA>

But their views are divergent and the aims they seek are often inconsistent. Pursuing the sale of the pipeline at any time may be of doubtful benefit, but there are particular dangers in pursuing the sale in this way, given the fluidity of competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When discussing the options for gas market structure, the various commentators and authorities in this area are generally assumed to take a strong pro-competition view.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill, the government is proposing the exact opposite. By merging part of the transmission and distribution of the gas industry in New South Wales, this bill would compromise the government's stated pro-competition aims. It would put AGL in a position to circumvent foreshadowed pro-competition legislation. The intended purposes of the recent interstate gas pipelines bill and the Council of Australian Governments agreement on free and fair trade in natural gas would be significantly compromised. The Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill, which was to establish  rules for interstate gas pipeline operators to limit monopoly abuses, has now been withdrawn or deferred because of the Council of Australian Governments agreement on free and fair trade in natural gas, which was reached by the heads of government in Hobart in late February this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The COAG agreement sets out a number of pro-competitive principles that would require complementary Commonwealth-state legislation to be settled by 1 January 1996. COAG's pro-competition emphasis is similar to that in the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill, however, the monopoly power of AGL would be strengthened. As the Industry Commission has warned, a private carrier carrying gas in its own pipeline, for distribution and sale through its own network, would be unwilling to carry a competitor's gas through its pipeline, even it had spare capacity. The Industry Commission's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Energy generation and distribution</EMPHASIS> report of May 1991 said that pipeline operators:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . through control of the existing transmission and distribution network, an integrated operator would have a strategic advantage over any potential rival suppliers of gas since it would in effect acquire advance notice of potential competition.</PARA>
<PARA>The passage of this bill would compromise these energy and competition aims that the government claims to support. The sale value of the Moomba-Sydney pipeline, even if the maximum information about industry structure and regulation were already known, would be difficult to assess, particularly when the pipeline user is a single retailer. Until these principles are at least fully debated by the public and the energy industry, the sale value of the pipeline is likely to be to the detriment of the public. The suggested total sale price of $500 million to $550 million may or may not be achieved. It is much less than previous valuations of close to $1 billion. Whether the current estimate would be a good price, given the potential loss to the national interest, is very doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Court of Appeal and High Court have confirmed that, under the amended haulage agreement, AGL has a `right of first refusal' if the government puts the pipeline up for sale.

The sale of a natural monopoly to a company involved elsewhere in the market, and subsequently attempting to impose an open access regime as suggested by the Industry Commission, the Council of Australian Governments and others, risks disaster, compared with imposing open access on the same enterprise in public ownership, for all the vertical integration problems the Industry Commission has raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Asset sales appear at first to improve the government's budgetary position. The government, through its task forces in the Department of Finance, is trying to juggle the conflicting aims of asset sales with inadequate success. It wants on the one hand to maximise the sale prices. The revenue is easy to present as a benefit of the process and makes the loss of the future income stream seem an insignificant factor. The higher the sale price, the less the loss of the given amount of future income will be noticed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the national interest concerns, such as a desire to maintain Australian ownership or control or to impose a regulatory regime on the industry that would foster competition, have to be given serious consideration. These are vexed issues with a natural network monopoly, as the unfolding saga of Austel, Telecom and Optus is showing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These market regulation restrictions affect the sale price adversely, regardless of whether their perceived benefits materialise in lower prices to consumers or expanded economic activity in the affected market. These benefits may or may not arrive some years after the bill has sacrificed both the greater sale price and the continuing revenue stream, which were the other major options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes a one-off sale designed to assist the government's current budget position. This would be at the expense of a combination of a continued revenue stream for the government arising from the pipeline's ability to generate economic rent, the access of gas producers and gas users to an independently owned and operated monopoly or open access network being restricted, and the potential for an increase in consumer gas prices as a result of the private monopoly seeking to recoup the pipeline purchase price to the benefit of its shareholders. In the current environment, given the conditional sale of 51 per cent to AGL, which retails the transported gas, it is likely that the greatest interest in the purchase of the remaining share of the pipeline will be shown by the current gas producer, Santos. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interests of prospective purchasers of the pipeline and the price that they are prepared to offer will depend largely on the nature and extent of the regulatory restrictions imposed. But where is the regulatory regime for the gas pipeline? Will it be next year or a decade away?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the proposed sale of Qantas, the change in the regulatory regime around the proposed asset sale has devalued the asset. In the Qantas case, its monopoly as Australia's scheduled international passenger airline was removed. By itself, this move devalued the airline as a saleable asset. To remedy this in part, Australian Airlines was absorbed into Qantas. The benefit to the potential sale price may have receded into the distance, given that the merger of Qantas and Australian Airlines has affected its domestic market share against Ansett and has taken its focus away from its cost structure and margins. The lesson of this is that assets should not be sold when the regulatory regime is under review or the government may lose on at least three counts: the loss of ongoing revenue; a depressed sale price; and the abuse of monopoly power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategic importance of the pipeline was the driving force behind the establishment of the authority in 1973. AGL was unable to purchase gas from the Gippsland-Bass Strait fields because of Victorian government restrictions. In an effort to guarantee its own gas supply, there was the need to look for another source, which was the Cooper Basin. In the medium term, the Cooper Basin will be exhausted and other sources will be sought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The options include a new pipeline to connect the next closest source&mdash;the Gippsland-Bass Strait fields, whose reserves are significantly greater than those of the Cooper Basin&mdash;with spare capacity. These reserves will be connected directly to the pipeline at Canberra or run via a new link from Albury-Wodonga to Wagga Wagga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest reserves of natural gas&mdash;over half of all Australian reserves&mdash;are off the north-west coast of Western Australia. The biggest gas markets are in the south-east population centres. In the long term, as the closer fields approach depletion, substantial investment will be required to build a new pipeline from one of the various north-west fields, probably Moomba, where it would join the existing line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This outlook is quite probable, with the time scale being the main unknown factor. In the circumstances, demand for use of the pipeline over the next 10, 20 or 30 years may vary significantly as would the revenue that it is capable of generating. As an investment by a private company, this represents a potential for great risk and uncertainty. Only depressing the sale price can compensate for this, which will reduce public revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is in a position to see the longer term need for the pipeline and its value in the long term as part of the extended supply system for the north-west. The value of the pipeline to the government over that period is almost certainly greater than it is to AGL. As the proceeds are certain to be undervalued, why sell at all?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Government at all levels, particularly over the past decade, has engaged in selling off publicly owned assets for a variety of stated reasons, the majority of which are not applicable or are positively dangerous when they are applied. The most frequently stated reason seems to be based on the idea that assets for sale represent underutilised capital in public hands and that a better return can be had by selling and utilising the resources elsewhere. The real reasons are generally different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the benefits of competition and private enterprise cannot be denied, the seemingly fundamentalist desire on the part of many to deliver all public assets to the free market is worrying. Given the seemingly endless collapses of private companies and continued widespread failures of entrepreneurs and private company directors, I find it hard to have such faith in a deregulated private sector. Asset selling is usually simply plundering the past to solve current shortfalls, leaving nothing for the future. Even asset selling to retire debt is purely short term; it does nothing to address the causes of debt. When asset sales reduce public income, as in many cases, this leaves the options of either raising taxes or cutting public services&mdash;the latter usually prevails. In many cases the asset sales involve a windfall profit, public subsidies or the potential to achieve these in the future. This bill contains all of these elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of the proposed gas pipeline sale is complicated by the authority's current agreement with AGL, which provides only for cost recovery and not a commercial rate of return on the current value of the authority's assets. The sale proceeds are reduced as long as this term of the agreement continues. For that reason alone, the sale is not justified. In any case, the government's investment in the pipeline over a 20-year period of construction and maintenance, with the current cost recovery arrangements and sale restrictions in place, represents a major sunk cost capable of either generating a depressed sale price, and at the same time compromising the government's stated aim of reforming the gas industry, or providing sufficient revenue to cover costs in the short term and generating profits for the government in the medium or long term once other gas suppliers and consumers take up the options that the reformed gas industry is supposed to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government's approach to this legislation will help set the tone for future gas industry legislation in the foreseeable future and will be taken to show the government's attitude to indiscriminate proposals for asset sales without adequate consideration of the valid warnings that have been raised, I urge the House to reject this bill. This bill sets completely the wrong tone regarding the approach to controlling private monopolies, improving the efficiency of the gas industry and other industries, the privatisation and monopoly profits at taxpayers' expense, and the value that the government puts or fails to put on years of investment in essential public infrastructure. The bill further compromises the limited benefits that were identified by the Industry Commission as flowing from a more level playing field regime, with fewer subsidies to selected industry players. I cannot recommend this bill to the House under any circumstances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will close the debate by referring to one or two points made by those who participated in the debate. Some very unnecessary affairs were expressed by the last speaker, the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), on one side of the ledger and on the other side of the ledger some totally unnecessary affairs were expressed by the two opposition members who moved and seconded the amendment. I will say a couple of things about the amendment that has been put.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally we do not accept the suggestions that are contained in paragraph (1) of the amendment, but we do note the extraordinary difficulty there is&mdash;as I think I said in my second reading speech&mdash;in getting the regulatory legislative negotiating environment right to conclude these matters. It is an extraordinary task, hopefully not an impossible one. As one of the opposition speakers suggested, the ghost of Rex Connor was looking over us. I think actually the ghost of Rex Connor sits firmly in the bill. He set up a barrel load of string. James Jesus Angleton, who was probably a very flawed counterintelligence operative, made one notable contribution to public discussion when he suggested that intelligence was a wilderness of mirrors. If ever there were a wilderness of mirrors, it would be trying to get to grips with the detail of how the agreement between the authority and AGL might be unravelled so that a sale could proceed. Naturally we do not accept paragraph 1 as a stricture of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hasty passage is rendered necessary by the difficulty of setting up a regulatory regime outside the gas bill that was withdrawn. That bill was withdrawn basically on undertakings given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at COAG in February. Since then it has been necessary to try to get the amendments together, following a bit of sensible consultation around the industry. If we look at how these things are normally done, we see that the timing has been pretty short order between then and now. Given the timing of sitting patterns, this is effectively about as early as we could bring it forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second paragraph of the amendment is unfortunate, although I do note that the way in which it is expressed is somewhat hedged about. It would be unfortunate if those conducting a negotiation with the Commonwealth drew any absolute comfort from the phraseology of the opposition's amendment. If there is, in a negotiating process, a sense on the part of one party that it has got more than a sniff of a chance of seeing its opponents overturned in the process of negotiation, the likelihood of necessarily reaching a hard and fast agreement on 20 May is somewhat diminished. Whether that applies depends on the way in which the opposition's paragraph (2) is read, as there may well be an assumption on the part of those negotiating at the moment with the Commonwealth that there would be a fair chance of a referral getting through the Senate. However, the way I would choose to interpret the opposition's words, it is leaving itself with ice to skate on. If it is left with ice to skate on, that offers less comfort to those who are negotiating with the Commonwealth than another interpretation that might be placed on those words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third paragraph of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the event that the Council of Australian Governments negotiates an agreement for the establishment of a set of national pipeline regulations, the Act be reviewed by the Minister for Resources to ensure that it conforms with such regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>I have absolutely no difficulty in giving the opposition an undertaking on that matter. I do not think that is an unreasonable proposition at all. It is contained in the third item. Were the bill to go through, the thing to be sold, and an agreement finally arrived at via the COAG process, it would be entirely appropriate for the Minister for Resources to check whether or not this bill conforms. Not only would it be entirely appropriate for him to do so but the partners in COAG would probably insist on it in any case if they had any problems at all with the regulatory regime that has been established here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go through in detail the other criticisms made in the course of the debate, but the time being such it is better that I conclude the debate at this point. Many of the issues will come up again when the amendments are discussed later on this evening in a series of blocks, so I will leave my remarks until then. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)congratulates Allan Robert Border AO, a former Australian of the Year, on representing his country with unparalleled success in his chosen field;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)recognises the courageous and tenacious leadership he has shown as captain of the Australian test cricket team; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)extends its best wishes to Allan and Jane Border and their family for a long and happy future.</PARA>
<PARA>Allan Robert Border has been a truly great test cricketer. He played 156 tests, more than any other player in the history of the game. He scored more runs than any player in the history of test cricket. He took more catches than any other fieldsman. He captained his country more times than any other player and has more victories to his credit than any other Australian captain. He has more centuries to his name than any other Australian, other than Sir Donald Bradman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are experts who will enjoy arguing about the dimension of Allan Border's achievements. It is enough, I think, for we inexpert Australians to pay due respect to a man whom we watched become an Australian legend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border came to the Australian cricket team near the end of a golden period for Australian cricket. He came to captaincy as the inevitable period of transition for the team reached a particularly difficult point. He did not seek the responsibility of leadership in those circumstances, but he did not shirk it either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the years since, he has come to embody qualities of tenacity, courage and devotion to his tasks to a degree which few Australians of any generation have ever matched. I think it is these qualities, not just the fact that he has been a great sportsman, which have given him a special place in cricket and in the hearts of cricket followers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became Prime Minister, I had the opportunity of supporting the Prime Minister's XI against a touring international side. The first time it was the West Indies and I called for Allan Border. I am no cricket authority, as many will know, but I do know an Australian with pride in Australia, and not that I see many opposite. The Prime Minister's XI was a side led by Allan Border and I knew that, as it was led by him, we would be all right. Allan responded with characteristic generosity. In fact, should Allan feel inclined to play one last game of cricket, I would love him to captain one more PM's XI. It would be his 10th time. Allan Border, the tenacious and skilful batsman and the courageous captain, was an inspiration to his country on and off the field. His great pride in his country rubbed off on all of us. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in speaking to this motion recognising the outstanding contribution of Allan Border not only as a cricketer but as an Australian. Cricket is our truly national sport. In that sense, I guess the captain of the Australian cricket team is among the most revered of all Australians. Allan Border's record, as the Prime Minister has stated, is an outstanding one which has been an inspiration to many. It will stand for a very long time as a monument to Allan Border's enormous contribution to Australian cricket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I think we should recognise something beyond his record. We should recognise the contribution of the man himself and the person that he was. It was Allan Border's character, as much as Allan Border's contribution to cricket, which I personally think was one of his outstanding achievements. He epitomised every aspect of the true Australian character. When the chips were down, Allan Border was in there, always doing his best. He was very generous when winning; he was very generous in defeat. In that sense, he established himself as a genuine Australian hero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the opportunity of seeing Allan Border in action in a very difficult set of circumstances. It was after the fourth test against the West Indies which was played in Adelaide in early 1993. It was a very exciting game and we lost by just one run. The mood in the change rooms that day was, as you would imagine, very depressed. I will never forget the way Allan Border handled what were very different circumstances with his troops at that particular time. Allan Border bowled every ball with every bowler. He fielded every ball with every fieldsman. He was genuinely the soul of the team, which is one of his most outstanding contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Prime Minister said, he came into cricket at a difficult time. He had the honour of rebuilding the Australian cricket team, winning the Ashes and the World Series, and defending the Ashes. As our national sport, cricket is one of those things that quite often does carry a nation through difficult times. The inspiration from the Ashes win and the Ashes defence to a country that was going into the deepest recession in 60 years was again another outstanding contribution by Allan Border. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the speech that was made today by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, in which he said that `increases in bond yields in Australia have been greater than in other countries'. In light of the claims by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that bond yields have been influenced only by events in the United States, does the Treasurer believe the Governor of the Reserve Bank is wrong in saying that interest rates increases have been `accentuated in Australia by specific concerns about the white paper and the budget'?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="808" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the movement in bond yields in this country which began straight after the change in official interest rates in the United States was aligned to that factor, and that factor alone. There was certainly no change in the economic fundamentals in Australia on 1 February that would have suddenly led the people in the bond markets to assume that there was going to be a fundamental change in Australia's medium-term inflation outlook or any other basic change to the Australian economic fundamentals which would have then led them to a process of pushing up bond yields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite obviously, the increase in bond yields was aligned absolutely to the fact that there was a movement in official interest rates in the United States. That increase in official interest rates in the United States led to increases in bond yields in that country and those who operate in the bond markets in this country reacted accordingly to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reactions have varied around the world. It is true to say that in Australia, for reasons that are rather difficult to understand, the increase in bond yields has been greater than in most other major countries. But again, that is a product of the reaction of the dealers in the bond market rather than it is of some assumption about Australia's economic outlook. That outlook essentially has not deteriorated one skerrick from what it was on 1 January to what it is now or what it has been over the past few months. To suggest that the increase in bond yields is in some way associated with some deterioration of the Australian economy or perceived deterioration by operators in bond markets is total self-delusion, and the Leader of the Opposition should know that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of criticism of the white paper on employment and growth, including suggestions that its aim was to effectively hide the unemployed? Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the government's response to these criticisms and to the suggestions that the white paper has been greeted with cynicism?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen those sorts of notions put about. If making the unemployed jobs-ready is hiding the unemployed, well so be it. If making young Australians more secure in the notion that the country cares about them, then so be it. The government at all stages has sought to buttress and support those who are unemployed. Yet the person who says loudest that we are going to hide the unemployed is the person who wanted to bump them off the queues after nine months. I would have thought that was hiding them pretty effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same party which a week ago was talking about inclusion and bringing everybody along, now, a week or two later, has forgotten as it goes back to attack the white paper&mdash;as the Leader of the Opposition said&mdash;as `Labor's Fightback'. `The white paper', he said, `will be Labor's Fightback.' In other words, the implication is that it will be Labor's disaster. It is a very peculiar brand of politician that actually gets up and advertises the disasters, saying, `Labor's white paper will be Labor's Fightback.' `We will make them account', he said, `for every word in it. We will make them do this, we will make them do that. We will analyse it. We will go through it just like they did ours.' The implication is, `We will reveal to them, like they revealed to us, that our paper was a sham.' You are a special, I have to say.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is all on the record. Pick up your quotes. There is not any notion of generosity, saying, `Here is a good thing that has been done. Here is something not just novel in our terms but in international terms. Let us give this a darned good try. Let us make sure that every conceivable effort is made to at least include all these people in Australian society. The Liberal Party will join with the government in trying to see that the import of the white paper is given every chance of success and of being given full effect.' No, no, no. The 24-hour repentance out in the motel on the highway here is all over. The Leader of the Opposition is now into the white paper. He is going to hop into the white paper whenever he gets a chance. The whole notion of inclusion which it has is to be attacked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So he is going back to it, he says, like Fightback. It is like Bonaparte going back to Waterloo. Not content to lose everything, he would go back and try to lose a bit more. The one thing, of course, that all this has revealed, as I said the other day, is the brutal regression of Fightback, the notions of selfishness, partisan wealth and partisan opportunity. It did not take long to revert to type. There was a glimmer of hope for the wets in the Liberal Party out at the conversion at the motel&mdash;to find that it lasted only a day. He is back today saying that he would also dismantle the Aboriginal land fund. This is the person who said that Aboriginal affairs was beneath his talents. He said that he would dismantle the land fund. I will say more about that later. On these two issues, the Leader of the Opposition has shown that he is still attached to the brutal regression of the Fightback document that he now holds up to us all as a disaster&mdash;the disaster which it was.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="809" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not at the centre left meeting this morning so, unlike the honourable member for Mayo, I am not sure how unhappy they were. I can say that the government made it quite clear in the budget speech and in the budget papers that the sale of the airports is something which the government believes is appropriate. I indicated in the budget speech that that would be subject to an appropriate process. That process will include discussion at the party conference in September. Clearly, that means that the decision to go ahead with the sale will depend on party approval at that conference. There will be a debate on that issue and it is a debate that the government does not expect to lose. So, in putting its position in the budget, the government was aware of previous debates of a similar nature that have taken place at previous party conferences. Bearing that in mind, we believe there is no doubt that the government will win that  debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deficit reduction program is a very important part of our economic program. Certainly, it is true that that is assisted by the airports sale. Over the years 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98, there is some contribution to the budget outcome assumed in the budget figuring from the sale of the airports. This is not the major way in which the deficit reduction program is brought about. What is driving the deficit reduction program is the reduction in outlays over the course of out years. It falls from 26.6 per cent of GDP this year to 24.2 per cent by 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we abstract asset sales from it, the decline is not 2.4 per cent; it is three per cent. From 27.2 per cent to 24.2 per cent is a three per cent decline. Take asset sales out of it and the underlying picture of constraint on outlays is even more sharply exposed. That is what is driving the deficit reduction program, not the asset sales&mdash;although they obviously provide a marginal assistance&mdash;and not increased taxes, because the taxes as a proportion of GDP increase only slightly over that period.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course there has been quite a bit of discussion since the government's budget forecast announcements of the 4 1/2 per cent growth and the 14 1/2 per cent investment increase for 1994-95. I think the reaction from business and financial observers has been quite encouraging and supportive, in general. Obviously there is a diversity of view, but there is a lot of supportive comment. I noticed particularly on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning that the rating agencies had some quite supportive things to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standard &amp; Poor's described the budget as a reasonable document. When invited to complain about our debt reduction strategy, its spokesman was reported as saying `you can always complain' but he saw no reason to do so. That is from the rating agencies. Standard &amp; Poor's is the group of people whose job it is to keep a close watch on our economic policies and to advise people if it thinks that those policies are untoward. Clearly he was being supportive in those statements. So also was Moodys, which described the budget policies as very reasonable under the circumstances. It said that the budget numbers were very comparable with its report published in April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not just the rating agencies that are making those supporting noises; local business has also been quite supportive. Let me mention some examples. KPMG Peat Marwick says the 14 1/2 per cent forecast is consistent with the March quarter boardroom opinion survey conducted by KPMG Peat Marwick and the Australian Institute of Company Directors. There is direct support from a survey conducted of those organisations giving views as to what the investment outlook is likely to be. The National Australia Bank spokesman, Haydn Park, said that the bank forecast investment to increase by more than 15 per cent. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All our surveys point to extremely high levels of business confidence and increasing capacity utilisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Bankers Trust's forecast of 15 per cent growth in business investment is higher than the government's estimate of 14 1/2 per cent. Its senior economist, Ms Cratchley, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's not hard to see a significant pick-up in investment, especially coming off such a low base.</PARA>
<PARA>What Ms Cratchley was talking about there is the fact that we have had that 25 per cent fall-off in business investment over the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 and then a flattening-out, so the bounce back is coming off that lower base. Bob Lim, Director of Policy Analysis and Research, Business Council of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Early returns from a survey of council members showed that one-third of respondents were planning to increase investment by more than 20 per cent between March and September.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the 14 1/2 per cent level of business investment is well within reach.</PARA>
<PARA>Today Paul Simons, the Chairman of Woolworths, speaking about both the 4 1/2 per cent forecast for growth and the 14 1/2 per cent, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think the 4 1/2 per cent is unattainable. I personally think we can achieve that 4 1/2 per cent. I am not an economist; I am just looking at sales figures in cash registers and things like that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, things that one would think had some relevance to the forecast. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As for business investment, the expectation that business investment will rise by 14 1/2 per cent does not seem to be an unreal expectation. If we take our own experience in Woolworths, for four years up till 1991 or thereabouts we were spending about $150 million a year on capital expenditure. We lifted it to $200 million for the year ending this year and in the coming year we are lifting it to $250 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very big increase&mdash;25 per cent&mdash;for Woolworths. He also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that I have not seen since 1974 a better environment for business.</PARA>
<PARA>That comes from one of our leading retailers, so we can see that there is major business support. A preview of the budget prepared for BHP's Chief Executive, John Prescott, by the company's economists, showed that it expected business investment to grow between 10 and 15 per cent during the financial year 1994-95. The Chief Executive Officer of the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who is not someone who normally makes comments in any way supportive of this government, said that the 14 1/2 per cent forecast was achievable. There is a lot of support in all of those comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the GDP forecast, the budget numbers have also been supported by Dresdner International's chief economist, Rob Henderson, who is reported to have said that the government's national growth estimate of 4 1/2 per cent was `certainly within the range of market forecasts', which run as high as five per cent. Another institution which the Leader of the Opposition should pay particular attention to&mdash;Macquarie Bank&mdash;since he had an association with it, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forecast of growth peaking at 4 1/2 per cent next financial year is unlikely to be a cause of lasting concern. Rather, the bank expected that the budget forecasts were likely to be exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a wide range of comments from business and financial analysts who are supporting the government's forecasts. Yet the opposition says that these are tricked up figures, figures that the government has just made up, and that they are unbelievable. But anyone listening to the opposition's comments should bear in mind what the Leader of the Opposition had to say last year. Prior to the budget last year, the Leader of the Opposition was saying these sorts of things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's in for a very rough trot. Our export competitiveness is falling, our capacity to compete in shrinking markets is even less than before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation is getting dramatically worse. Australia is in long-term decline and a wasteland of economic stagnation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this talk about how the economy is growing very strongly is just dead wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that before last year's budget. When the budget forecast came out and we forecast 2 3/4 per cent growth in GDP&mdash;remember that?&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is as much chance of this dodgy and hurtful economic prescription producing a lasting recovery as there is of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer finding the Loch Ness monster.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to describe the budget forecasts as `pie in the sky'. He said the forecasts were pie in the sky, very optimistic growth numbers. What happened? Instead of 2 3/4 per cent growth, what has happened through calendar year 1993, the last period for which we have figures? Not 2 3/4 per cent, not something way below that, not economic stagnation or pie in the sky, but much more than 2 3/4 per cent&mdash;four per cent growth. So anyone who listens to the Leader of the Opposition tonight saying that our figures are unbelievable should bear in mind his forecasts last year, and they were massively unbelievable.</PARA>

How can this be reconciled with the need for greater resources for infrastructure given Australia's comparative disadvantage of distance and the fact that Australia has the fastest population growth of all industrialised countries, particularly in the last decade? What policies does the government have to address the substantial need for increased resources to arrest the consequent deterioration in education, health, road, rail, water supply, sewerage and other infrastructure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia had an acute savings problem in the 1980s when the public sector was heavily in deficit, thanks to the inadequacy of the then coalition government. There was an almost exclusive dependence upon commodities for our international earnings and, commodities having let Australia down badly, in 1985-86 Australia was into the lowest terms of trade since the Depression. As a consequence, there was a massive adjustment to fiscal policy. As a result of that adjustment, Australia fared much better as a society and much better as an economy than it would have done had that adjustment not been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was made across the board in general recurrent spending and also in capital spending. As a consequence, outlays fell from 30 1/2 per cent of GDP&mdash;that was from our little big-spending friend over here&mdash;to 23 1/2 per cent of GDP. It fell by seven per cent of GDP&mdash;the largest fall in outlays to GDP in the OECD area, amounting to the equivalent of around $28 billion to $30 billion change in each Australian budget in every subsequent year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of that has changed in the meantime. The underlying level of outlays has not changed very much from those remedial changes, but higher unemployment benefits increase outlays and the cyclical increase in outlays in the One Nation statement made a change to those particular areas of the public infrastructure which we thought were in desperate need of change. One, of course, was the trunk rail system, where there had been no investment by the states for God knows how long&mdash;30 years or more&mdash;in the main systems between Brisbane and Sydney, Sydney and Melbourne, Melbourne and Adelaide, et cetera.</PARA>

I am very pleased to say that the budget delivers that land fund. The government will allocate $200 million in 1994-95 to the fund and $121 million thereafter for each of nine years to a fund which will be established by legislation later this year. The moneys will be invested so as to accumulate a self-sustaining fund for the acquisition and management of both existing and newly acquired indigenous land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say in this context that I was astonished to see that the opposition has pledged to dismantle the fund if it ever won office. I know I should not be astonished at anything the opposition says these days about matters relating to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. When the Leader of the Opposition first entered the federal parliament, he said that the Aboriginal affairs portfolio was beneath his talents. He said that he lived in fear of being given the portfolio. Last year, of course, we saw the persistent non-policy in respect of Mabo and the consistent opposition to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is talking about disincentives to work, but he is not talking about a poverty trap, absolutely. With those changes we are taking away the poverty trap which said to people that they could earn over a wide spectrum of income additional income and receive no net benefit in their total income because they would lose dollar for dollar on the basis of their unemployment benefit. We are taking that away and moving instead to a system where, however much people work, they are better off. So there is no disincentive to work: the more dollars you earn, the more dollars you are better off. The new system is all about providing incentives to work and ensuring that there always is an incentive to work more. That is what the system is designed to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You are comparing the new system with the current system, which has a slightly more generous free area before one starts to lose 50c in the dollar. To contain the cost of this item&mdash;I remind you, these improvements are costing the outlays over $300 million in a full year&mdash;we have brought the start point back to the $30 zone where there is a reduction of 50c in the dollar and the additional amount for earned income over $30 will no longer apply. So people earning a certain amount above $30, compared with what they get now, will be slightly worse off but they can work their way out of that quite simply by undertaking some more work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the opposition would be very supportive of a system which totally eliminates a poverty trap and says that however much you earn you will always be better off so there is no point at which you simply earn more money without getting any more remuneration overall. I would have thought that the opposition would have been supportive of a system where you were always better off and which provided an absolute incentive to work. If the opposition is being critical and saying that we should have devised a system in which no-one, compared with the current system, was at any stage worse off for a given amount of earned income, then it is saying again that there should have been a much bigger expenditure on this system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument again raises the issue that my colleague the Minister for Finance raised yesterday: that you are continually in this bifurcated position where you berate us on the one hand for not reducing the deficit further&mdash;and you say that we should not do it by increasing taxes; we should do it by containing outlays&mdash;and on the other hand, in relation to specific issues, one by one you all get up and say, `Why don't you spend more on this? Aren't you bad for not spending more on this particular item?' The Leader of the National Party is implying that we should have spent a lot more money on this welfare item, unless he is also saying that we should not have had the reform at all and that we should have kept the system in place where there were absolute disincentives to work and a complete poverty trap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your position has to be one of two: either you support the change, but you say that it should have been done on a much more costly basis, or you do not support the change&mdash;you think we should have stayed where we were and had a system where there are no incentives to work over a wide spectrum of income.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="817" SPEAKER="Lee The Hon M.J." NAMEID="MG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DOBELL" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS; TOURISM" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In recognition of the very high standards of national broadcasting that we enjoy in Australia, the government is going to ensure there are significant funds for the further improvement and extension of SBS and ABC services. Under the triennial funding arrangements, funding for these organisations will be maintained in real terms for the next three years. Triennial funding gives those organisations the long-term planning certainty they need to produce the excellent programming which they have delivered in the past. That means that in 1994-95 the ABC will receive $515 million and SBS television will receive $76 million to continue to provide their excellent television and radio programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This funding is accompanied by additional funding for the extension of the national transmission facilities to allow more Australians, particularly in rural and regional Australia, to have access to these services. There is already a program of rolling out ABC Radio National, ABC Classic FM  and Triple J to many new regional areas. SBS television, which has recently been extended to northern Tasmania, much to the joy of the honourable member for Bass, is about to be extended to Darwin, much to the joy of the honourable member for the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the budget an additional $4.9 million was provided to extend SBS television into the Richmond-Tweed area, which I am sure has the support of the honourable member for Richmond, not to mention an extension of SBS television to the Wide Bay-Sunshine Coast area, which I think has the nod from the honourable member for Fairfax and the honourable member for Wide Bay. I am not sure whether it had the full support of the Leader of the National Party but, unless the other two opposition members try to convince me otherwise, those are the areas that are getting SBS television next. This will ensure that more than an extra half a million Australians will have access to SBS television. It will mean that, for example, when the World Cup is played in June this year, about 15 million Australians will be able to watch the full 180 hours of the World Cup soccer&mdash;every minute of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SBS television does provide a unique service. It allows all Australians to have a chance to learn about other cultures. It tries to ensure that multiculturalism is better understood throughout the population and it is something that all of us are seeking to encourage. I commend SBS on its recent extension of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Worldwatch</EMPHASIS> television news program. People are now able to watch a daily news service from Germany's ZDF network in German, from Italy's Rai TV in Italian, from Hong Kong's ATV service in Cantonese and from Greece's Antenna TV service, giving Greek Australians a chance to see the latest news programs in their mother tongue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABC television did pretty well in the recent national Logie awards. The most outstanding drama went to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix II</EMPHASIS>. The most outstanding documentary went to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor in Power</EMPHASIS>, which might not have had the Prime Minister's vote but, the way the opposition is going, I think there will be one or two sequels to that series, which will have the Prime Minister's endorsement. The most outstanding comedy went to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Late Show</EMPHASIS>. I know there has been some concern about the ABC's repertoire with comedy this year but, while it may have lost the live broadcast of question time in the House of Representatives, it now has <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frontline</EMPHASIS> to make up for it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing new about this at all. This is something which stems from last year's budget. What was spelt out in last year's budget was the cut in company tax. We had the reduced rate of company tax of 33c in the dollar. To cover that for a number of years, there was a process of bringing forward company tax payments. That commences this year and provides some offset to what would otherwise be a much bigger fall in company tax receipts than would be the picture without that bring forward. So it is a substantial offset. Part of the answer to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday is precisely that point. There is that bring forward of company tax in the rolling way in which over the years we introduce that new system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questioner is asking: is this some imposition on companies? There are various points to make about that. Firstly, this is all in the context of a very substantial reduction in company tax. We are going down from 39c to 33c. The opposition seems to think that that is not good enough. I remind it of Fightback, which wanted a 42c company tax rate. The opposition was quite happy to see company tax at 42c in the dollar. The government has reduced it to 33c. Now the opposition seeks to make some capital out of the fact that it is being offset over a few years by a rearranged process of company tax payments, which means over that period that there is some bring forward and offset to the company tax reduction. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the basic rate cut is there. It is a substantial ongoing benefit to business. Business appreciates that. This issue of the bring forward is an absolute non-issue. In all of the business discussions I have had no-one is raising that point. That is last year's discussion. I think the opposition should get up to date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her very serious question about a matter of great public importance. I am pleased to emphasise to the House that the Commonwealth continues to place the greatest importance on public accountability in giving effect to the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. That is why the response to recommendation No. 1 of the royal commission from the Commonwealth is significantly tougher than the recommendation itself. It includes a commitment to an annual report from the Commonwealth on measures taken in response to the royal commission. It includes a commitment by governments to cross-tabling, with state and territory and Commonwealth governments agreeing to that arrangement for their annual reports. It includes a commitment to raise royal commission responses and action on those responses at ministerial forums. It includes the establishment of the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also, for the purposes of the parliament, I think, gives this House and the parliament generally an important role in respect of monitoring the royal commission recommendations and responses on them. The state governments of Queensland and Western Australia have, together with the Commonwealth, already produced their annual reports on the royal commission responses. I have already referred the Commonwealth report to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I have pleasure, for the information of the House, in tabling the reports of Western Australian and Queensland and inform the House that I intend to write to the chairperson of the House of Representatives committee asking the committee to give consideration to those state reports in addition to the Commonwealth report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. My department is commemorating this important event. We have sought to link the contribution made by those who fought for their country during World War II with recognition of the women who did their part by staying in Australia either in the home or doing war work. A major documentary called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War of Distance</EMPHASIS> sponsored by my department and which highlights the effects of war on Australian women and their families from World War II to the present day will be shown on ABC television on Sunday, May 15 at 8.30 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">War of Distance</EMPHASIS> achieves this link through the rare skill of the director, Megan Simpson Huberman, who tells frankly but sensitively the stories of women who lived through World War II and of the daughters of men who returned from the battlefields. I had a sneak preview of it, as you would expect, and it left me with the very poignant image of a  young lass of about five or six years hiding behind a kitchen door, clutching a photograph of her father who had just returned from the war. He was meeting his daughter for the first time in a couple of years. She was very frightened to go out and meet him because she did not remember who he was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the eyes of the wives, widows and daughters of the Australian servicemen who left our shores to fight in Europe, Asia and Africa, the documentary lifts the veil on the silent war fought by many women in families at a time when there was no subsidised housing and, at least initially, very few jobs. A lot of these women who ended up being widows later had to look after vastly changed men, vastly changed husbands, who had come back and who in many cases were desperately ill. For them the war continued for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The documentary is a remarkable insight into the way the war opened up new opportunities for many of our nation's women in business, trades and the armed forces. These changes, though initially short-lived, had effects on women and on society generally that are still being felt today. Most probably that was the beginning of the improved position that women hold in Australian society today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budgetary process is plainly engineered by people who have more interest in retaining power for themselves than in having an understanding of, or commitment to, the social and economic needs of this country. Nowhere is this more evident than in the treatment of rural and regional Australia. The process of fleecing the bush whilst distracting attention by creating a lot of noise and hoopla over the handing out of a few relatively unimportant trinkets and baubles has become nothing less than an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the government handing out $35 million in regional development funding initiatives for the coming financial year in its regional development strategy. We see it bragging&mdash;utterly misleadingly&mdash;about a boost of $70 million in funding for primary industry in the budget. We can conclude only that it wants regional Australia to think that it is being very generous. It does not want regional Australia to look at what has been pulled out of it in taxes and charges, especially taxes and charges on wealth creating, export dedicated economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that sums many times larger than the crumbs that the government hands back are being pulled out of the bush. For that, the government plainly expects to be hailed as the saviour of the bush. It certainly does not want anyone to focus on the fact that not only are those taxes and charges already very high but it continues to increase those taxes and charges. Again, the overwhelming increase appears to be in taxes and charges which fall on economic, wealth creating activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appears to have very cunningly approached the problem of the politics of this by announcing most of the coming nasties, not in this budget, but in the budget before, because it wants Australians to believe it has its house in order, that it has reined in expenditure and waste, and that it does not need so much of taxpayers' money. The fact is that it is not true. The tax take over the next 12 months will increase very savagely. It has to, despite the big deficit, to cover the big spending outlined in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no mistake: the impact on regional Australia will be directly counter to the supposed objectives of the government to regenerate prosperity, wealth and job opportunities either in the regions or anywhere else in the country. The government will suck out what wealth and confidence remain at the very time that a tentative turnaround, a tentative recovery, is just beginning to engender a little hope, when it is just beginning to encourage our farmers and our regional enterprises&mdash;large and small&mdash;to think of opening the cheque book and to think perhaps of starting to reinvest. Honourable members opposite ought to have a good look at the bush in Australia today. Much of it has been gutted. In many areas, it is doubtful whether local economies will ever recover from the impact of the recession those opposite said we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently released McKinsey report on business investment in regional Australia&mdash;a lot of work on this has been done by my good friend the honourable member for Maranoa  (Mr Bruce Scott)&mdash;claims to have exposed the so-called myth that rural Australia is in decline, but it did not. It actually showed that 41 per cent of country towns, most of them with populations under 5,000, are in decline and that another 18 per cent are growing but growing more slowly than the capital cities. In other words, the gap is widening. A very large part of the reason for this is that our rural and primary industries right across the regions of this country are in a lot of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm debt levels are horrendous. According to ABARE, farm debt now totals nearly $18 billion. It is little wonder that a recent survey of farmers undertaken for the government established that 28 per cent of them feel like just giving up and walking away. Rural banks are closing; rural government services are being withdrawn. Depression, family break-up and even suicide are unfortunately common. Unemployment is unacceptably high in general terms and horrifically high amongst young people, in particular in regional Australia. The problem has been hugely exacerbated by the raft of existing and ever increasing taxes and charges imposed by the current government. I find it impossible to believe that the government has no understanding of their impact, yet it is obvious that the government hopes the poor old milch cows will miss the point. It wants the situation camouflaged and hopes that the camouflage will work. </PARA>

We ought to take note of what the outgoing chairman of the NFF said here in Canberra just yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of, in fact the abuse of, the indirect tax system will be one of the biggest threats to the farm sector's competitive position in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>By extension, that means the competitiveness of all of our export industries. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indirect taxes inevitably increase costs more in sparsely settled areas because indirect taxes apply both to the landed cost of goods, and to the transport needed to land them in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>Taxing wealth creating activities to death the way the mob opposite do is stupid and ridiculous, because it simply reduces the size of the cake and the number of slices available to go around. Where is the social justice we hear so much about? More and more people are feeling more and more pressured to claim their share of an ever dwindling cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government brags about a $70 million increase in primary industry spending. That is one of the more interesting little fiddles in this year's budget. Spending is no more than normal&mdash;in fact it may be less than normal&mdash;in this portfolio area this year. This year it cut anticipated outlays in the current budget year in a one-off situation. It was able to claw back from the states some $87 million in rural adjustment scheme reserves. The truth is that the budget papers show that less will be spent in primary industry this year than normal, not more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many hard-pressed wool growers, and the equally hard-pressed communities in which they live and which are dependent on them, will be amazed to learn that their problems are over; that their industry is back in profitable circumstances; and that, therefore, exceptional circumstances funding for the wool industry can be finished up from June of this year. The claim is absurd. To say that not all of the money made available last year was drawn is simply to reflect upon the eligibility criteria and its lack of realism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say that recovery in the wool industry is now complete to the extent that the industry is out of trouble is also absurd. It has had three or four years of disastrous losses. Only now is the market indicator again just approaching cost of production levels. For government members to turn their backs not only on the farmers involved but also on the communities that are so dependent upon them out there in Bourke and those sorts of places scattered across so much of Australia is to give the lie to the talk about concern for social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware of federal Treasury's assessment in late 1991 of the impact of indirect taxes on a whole range of Australian industries, including agriculture, mining, food processing, forests and forest products. These industries are the economic heart of not just rural and regional Australia but the whole of the nation. They are haemorrhaging badly, but the government has not even attempted to deal with the problem adequately. Treasury found that every year, using just two of the economic leeches used by this government&mdash;fuel excise and wholesale sales tax&mdash;the government bleeds more than $3.2 billion out of these industries. And that was three years ago. Both taxes have been increased substantially since, and they now continue to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury figures, which those opposite do not dispute, tell us that every 1c increase in fuel excise adds $66 million to the costs of these industries, sapping their ability to compete in the export markets that Labor rightly tells us we must win. The 5c a litre increase in fuel excise imposed in last year's budget has already increased the costs of agriculture, mining, forestry and food processing by $264 million. There is another $66 million hike still to come in August. And apparently we are not supposed to believe there will be any tax increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly we will probably hear a government member address this House and claim, as one minister recently did, that I do not understand fuel excise, because farmers receive&mdash;government members say&mdash;a diesel fuel excise rebate. That is quite true. But the Treasury figures do not lie. They represent the real fuel tax burden remaining on farmers after the rebate is allowed for&mdash;a burden which is now more than $800 million a year, almost as much as the government is going to spend on road funding in total this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace that the government will milk some $9.7 billion from road users next year by way of fuel excise but return less than 1c in 10c in dedicated road expenditure. In a huge continent like ours, it ought to go without saying that a significant proportion of our export industry is derived from rural based industries and we need a cheap and efficient transport system. Good roads, therefore, are critical&mdash;not just to rural and regional Australia but to the broader economy&mdash;to maintaining the competitiveness of our industries and to social policy. Roads are vital linkages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will probably be told by someone opposite that Australia is amongst the countries with the cheapest petrol in the world. But this ignores a couple of matters. The first is those long distances and the isolation&mdash;the tyranny of distance, as Geoffrey Blainey called it. The second is that diesel is the primary transport fuel in this country, not petrol. Believe it or not, according to the International Energy Agency, we tax our diesel more highly than the United States, Japan, Canada, Taiwan, Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Mexico. Cheap fuel? What is the government talking about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues such as roads remain a real measure of Labor's commitment to the bush. Tragically in this area the government can only be said to have been found wanting and to have overlooked every opportunity to invest in a vitally important matter of infrastructure critical to the full economic recovery of this country. The government's white paper allocated just $35 million this year to its regional development strategy, compared with the massive amounts it is sucking out in taxes and charges. It is another case of trying to distract the community with baubles and trinkets when substance, quality, depth, planning and vision are needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most outstanding forecast in the whole of the budget papers was for business investment growth&mdash;an estimated 14.5 per cent when the outcome for the current year has been closer to one per cent. There is nothing in the budget that will boost in business the necessary confidence to invest. In many industries I suspect there is still a lot of idle capacity waiting to be filled up before there is a need for reinvestment. Where full output is almost being reached or has been reached, it may well be that the government's snail-like progress on micro-economic reform will mean that investment dollars in new capacity, where it does occur, increasingly will be directed towards Asia and more competitive economies. I suspect that the Access Economics forecast of about seven per cent investment in the coming year is probably closer to the mark. Such an outcome will expose very quickly the government's big spending attempt to create two million jobs for the fraud that I believe it really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I cannot help emphasising the point that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), made yesterday that tax in real terms will increase by 7.4 per cent in the next financial year&mdash;far above even the government's increased estimations of the likely inflationary outcome over the next 12 months. Yet the government, unbelievably, continues to claim that there are no new taxes in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these rises and the huge and fudged deficit, the Commonwealth is going deeper into debt. This, coupled with the lack of investment and improvement in productivity, will almost certainly mean that inflationary pressures will re-emerge and interest rates will be higher than they need to be. They will at the very least be higher than they would have been had the government not sought to snatch the so-called gross dividend for itself. This is the real reason why this budgetary approach is directly counter to the government's stated objective of restoring prosperity and wealth. Nothing could be more damaging to the real interests of social and economic recovery in the regions of this nation than a re-emergence of high interest rates, and nothing would snuff out economic recovery so quickly, and with it dash so many hopes&mdash;the hopes of farm families, of the small businesses in our rural towns, and of the people who either work for them or work on them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is that time of the afternoon when the opposition has to put up what is loosely termed a matter of public importance. There is a bit of sameness about it. I suppose today was the turn of the poor old honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) to rustle up a speech, come in here and try to attack the government when recovery is at four per cent and going up. Of course, it has not escaped our attention that had those opposite been elected this would have been the budget that would have introduced the goods and services tax of 15 per cent on electricity, water, car repairs&mdash;in fact, on every service that currently is not taxed. It would have been the budget that would have introduced a 42c tax rate for business. That has not escaped our attention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been able to bring down a budget and introduce major initiatives to reduce long-term unemployment without increasing taxes. I think that is what particularly upsets those opposite: we have not introduced new taxes or put up the rates of existing taxes. They keep saying that tax revenue is going up. Of course, we would expect that. Because the economy is growing, tax revenue is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do opposition members want? Do they want us to have a growing economy and collect less tax? Of course, the simple fact is that the more economic activity there is, the more tax is collected as a result. The bad news for the opposition is that already the economy has had 2 1/2 years of sustained growth and it is forecast to continue growing strongly. As I said a minute ago, it is currently growing at four per cent and into this financial year we anticipate that growth will accelerate to 4 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, all of this growth means that dividends are up and company profits, as a percentage of GDP, are at record levels. Taxable company income is forecast to increase by 13 1/4 per cent in 1993-94, once again with a growing economy. With a growing economy, average earnings are up. They increased by just over four per cent last year and are forecast to increase by over 2 1/2 per cent this year and by 3 1/2 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before opposition members start pointing out that average earnings are increasing, I point out that at the same time real unit labour costs have been falling, and that is because productivity growth has outstripped the growth in wages. That means that people are producing more and earning more and, not surprisingly, tax revenue is increasing, once again with a growing economy. That does not mean they are actually worse off; in fact, real household disposable income has increased, in part because of tax cuts, and will increase over the forecast period because of increased employment and higher earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, our fiscal strategy is aimed at reducing  the government's call on savings but, at the same time, this government is providing policies to address the social needs of our times. By reducing the budget deficit to 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, the government will be freeing up resources for private sector investment and, of course, that will keep the recovery going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from taxes going up, we have actually made a few tax concessions and a few tax cuts. Let us have a look at the concessions for a start. The government has decided to reform the tax concessions for infrastructure bonds to further increase the pool of funds available to the private sector to provide infrastructure. Eligibility for infrastructure bonds will be broadened to include the following sectors: aviation facilities; electricity transmission and distribution and gas transmission facilities; water and sewage treatment projects and other water infrastructure. The tax concessions will be changed to provide the option of a tax rebate of 33 per cent as an alternative to the current non-assessable income arrangements to make infrastructure bonds attractive for taxpayers with marginal tax rates below 33 per cent. Of course, that picks up many of our major institutional investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget also addresses the issue of pooled development funds. To assist small and medium sized businesses, the tax rate applying to PDFs' earnings on small to medium sized enterprise investments will be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This will make them a much more attractive investment vehicle and, in this improving economic climate, these new concessions and modified operating guidelines for PDFs will assist the private sector in playing its part in funding suitable venture and development projects of small to medium sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of other measures also included in this budget, and I will just go through them very briefly. Of course, when we talk about assistance in the budget, we are talking about assistance to business to make sure that the recovery is not only maintained but also enhanced into the future. Some of the measures in the budget that will bring that about are: easier access for small and medium businesses to the 150 per cent research and development tax concession; training for bankers, accountants and business advisers to enhance awareness of small to medium sized business needs; the introduction of a system of benchmarking best practice in manufacturing to help banks to assess future prospects for small and medium businesses; support for a network of state chambers of commerce to pilot a business equity information service for investors and investees; expert advice on export finance and preparation of loan applications; provision of up to $32 million over the next four years to encourage enterprises to form networks; a business regulation reform package to review all Commonwealth regulations; and an allocation of $9.6 million over the next four years to a support for Australian suppliers scheme. This initiative is designed to improve awareness of government purchasing needs and improve information about potential Australian suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives come on top of the already very favourable tax regime for business created by this government in recent years. I remind the House of a few of those provisions: accelerated depreciation allowances; a  development allowance for large projects; the general investment allowance, a 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure; and reduction of company tax to an internationally competitive rate of 33 per cent. Those measures alone will cost the budget $3 billion this year and more in out years. Yet the honourable member for Gwydir gets up and talks about the way in which industry in Australia is handicapped when it has to go out and compete in the world markets. How does the opposition think companies would get on if it were in government introducing a goods and services tax with a company tax rate of 42 per cent? At 33 per cent, companies have a chance; at 42 per cent, the opposition would have flattened them. Not only would the opposition have flattened them, but also it would have choked them with paperwork, especially small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that we have tax concessions. We also have tax cuts in this budget. Aside from the concessions and the other measures I have outlined to assist business, the budget contains some tax cuts which I thought some honourable members may have noticed. From midnight on budget night, we have reduced the customs and excise duty on fuel oil, heating oil, kerosene, and oil used in refining. Also from midnight on Tuesday, we reduced the rate of wholesale sales tax applying to low-alcohol wine and cider and other similar low-alcohol beverages. In actual fact, not only is it a budget in which there were no tax increases, it is a budget in which we actually made tax concessions and tax cuts&mdash;exactly the opposite to what the honourable member for Gwydir has been trying to instil in the debate. </PARA>

Nothing is more important in terms of building social cohesion and a just society than reducing unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to get a policy where no opposition backbencher would be denied the chance to interject, and the honourable member for Moore does it more than others. The government has allocated $2.2 billion to labour market programs in 1995-96, which is the first full year of the job compact. This will provide around 650,000 labour market program places&mdash;something that the opposition would never have done or even thought about. There will be an increased focus on identifying those with a high risk of becoming long-term unemployed and providing them with the support and training they require. In a recovery, those with higher skills will more readily find their own jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those assessed as being at high risk of becoming long-term unemployed will be offered case management counselling, job search assistance, appropriate training and subsidised employment. Under the job compact, over 150,000 jobs will be made available to the long-termed unemployed. The job compact is a commitment by the government to provide a real job to all those who have been on unemployment allowances for more than 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> People should cast their minds back to what was in Fightback. Those opposite were going to tip people off the unemployment benefit after nine months. Contrast that sort of an approach to the approach outlined in Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector, the compact will include the following: more intensive case management; training and support to ensure that the client is job ready; intensive job search assistance; and a referral to suitable vacancies at the end of the job to maximise employment outcomes for those assisted by the job compact. Wage subsidies will be restructured to provide higher subsidies to those who have been out of work the longest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage will provide a substantially increased incentive to employers and employees and will be a fundamental reform. But, by contrast with the opposition, this is not the poverty training wage that it advanced. Its proposal provided no award protection, no accredited training program and no portable certificate at the end of the training. It was aimed only at lowering the real wages of young people. There was no thought of an adult training wage. Its policy was to provide a $3 per hour wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What little policy the opposition had in terms of training wages&mdash;it was very sketchy&mdash;could never have been delivered. It could never have got the agreement of both the employers and the trade union movement to a policy that did not have award protection and some minimum built-in standards that Australians have come to rightly accept when they go into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will now touch on some income support measures. Working Nation also addresses the need for the reform of our social security system to better reflect the changes in our society and to remove disincentives to work. In many cases, some of these policies have not been changed since the 1940s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policy strongly supports measures that promote choice, equity and economic independence for women. Changes in income support arrangements are a departure from the system which assumes that women are dependent on their partners. We are in favour of a system of treating women as individuals. The new parenting allowance, paid directly to the spouse caring full time for children at home, provides greater choice to low income families when they are deciding how to balance work and family demands. It gives the carers, who are usually the mothers, an income in their own right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, I will say this: this budget is good news. It contains no new taxes, it keeps inflation low and it will increase employment.

I will also concentrate on part of that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that the Assistant Treasurer or any other member of the government has not acknowledged is the new tax that is being levied on aviation fuel. That is a huge new impost. Its effect on regional and rural Australia, the development of infrastructure for Australia and the provision of real jobs for young Australians is absolutely immense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was interested to read in the news reports of a study that is being done by the United Graziers Association of Queensland. We would all be aware that under this government these new taxes&mdash;they are new taxes&mdash;on the cost of fuel are pretty heavy. People will now be paying a tax rate of 24.331c per litre on avgas. Avtur did not have a tax before. There will be a new impost of 1.46c per litre. There is no suggestion that that is not a new tax, but it is. Look at what that will do in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to see that the Queensland branch of the UGA has called for the elimination of fuel excise for all aircraft. It has done this because it has worked out that the increase in the tax will mean that the cost of a day's mustering will rise by $30. That is an unbelievable impost. I suppose that the imposition of these new taxes on aviation fuel is fairly typical of this government. As I say, if something moves, the government taxes it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Absolutely no thought has been given to the flow-on effect of these measures. We are told that they are based on a user-pays principle and that this is part of bringing in a revenue regime to help pay for the provision of safety services in Australia. That might sound all right, but the problem is that the government has no idea of how this industry works. If it is going to pay for aviation safety, the last people who should be taxed on this fuel are people running around paddocks mustering sheep or cattle, because they do not use any of the aviation safety facilities. It has been applied across the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What will happen with regional services to the remote areas of Australia as a result of the increase in the fuel price? We have seen that a number of aviation operators are in trouble. In a speech last week by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) there was an acknowledgment that a number of aviation operators have financial problems. But the government does not take any notice of that. It just taxes people a bit more. It does not worry that rural Australia will lose some of those services and the provision of some of the infrastructure that is so vital to its getting back on its feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of taxing anything that moves also applies to registered public transport in Australia. The imposition of that tax will load about another $19 million per year onto the airlines. That is a huge impost. Is it not crazy when we are trying to build up a tourist industry that has the capacity to build jobs for young Australians to impose a new charge of $1 million per year on the two international airlines of Qantas and Ansett just for the privilege of operating internationally? Is it not interesting that the other international carriers coming into Australia do not have to pay that? Only the host carriers will pay it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No matter how many times the opposition recycles this debate, no matter how many times we hear the echo of yesterday's debate, there is one solid fact the opposition cannot avoid: Australia is a low tax nation. Australia is a low tax nation by any standard, particularly those of the OECD. We are a low tax nation because of the policies of this government. There are no new taxes in the budget for 1994-95, no increase in tax rates for 1994-95 and no hidden tax increases in the coming financial year. That goes to the heart of the sham of this debate proposed by the opposition. The matter of public importance listed for debate talks about hidden tax increases, yet neither of the speakers from the opposition identified one single hidden tax increase in the budget delivered on Tuesday night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They go on in their matter of public importance to talk about the impact on social recovery in Australia. Neither speaker for the opposition had one thing to say about social policy, because the opposition does not have any social policy or ideas about social recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter of public importance; this is a matter of frustration on the part of members of the coalition&mdash;the frustration of knowing in their heart of hearts that the white paper has quality written all over it; knowing in their heart of hearts that this is a quality budget; and knowing on their political agenda that they lost an election at the bottom of the business cycle. That is the frustration of the opposition and why it needs to bring forward for debate in this House a debate it had yesterday, a debate where the government showed we are a low tax country. The frustration of the opposition comes out in these debates&mdash;the frustration of knowing that only a Labor government has made Australia one of the lowest taxed countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who has now left the chamber, would know that, when he went out as Treasurer in 1982-83, revenue in the budget as a portion of GDP was 26.1 per cent. The forecast for 1995 is 23.7 per cent. That is an $11 billion difference in real terms in the tax burden that this government has avoided by lowering tax&mdash;$11 billion less in tax collected by this government in real terms than when the honourable member for Bennelong left the treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government in 1983 inherited a top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent and a lowest rate of 30 per cent. Those rates today are 47 per cent and 20 per cent. They have come down substantially. For business investment, we have a company tax rate which is internationally competitive at 33 per cent. In the last 18 months this government has produced a whole range of concessions and allowances for the business sector, particularly advantageous to rural Australia, which is the subject of the opposition's matter of public importance. There are allowances and concessions to the tune of $3 billion in 1994-95 dollars, including accelerated depreciation allowances, a development allowance for large projects, a general investment allowance, 150 per cent write-off for research and development expenditure and that very important company tax rate of 33 per cent. On top of that, in the white paper Working Nation the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced substantial improvements to the taxation treatment of infrastructure bonds and pooled development funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a beautiful taxation environment for investment in the rural sector and throughout regional Australia&mdash;a beautiful environment in which farmers as small, medium or large sized businesses can invest and know that the government has a low tax regime in place. The opposition should acknowledge those things and should support the sophisticated and modern framework this government has put in place for economic and social strength throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are moving very strongly into a growth economy&mdash;a growth economy underpinned by this government's social safety net. We have seen, in the 12 months since April 1993, the creation of 230,000 new jobs in Australia. We have a most attainable growth forecast of 4.5 per cent for 1994-95, the highest rate among the OECD nations for the next financial year; unemployment coming down, as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) announced today; a strong deficit reduction strategy; international competitiveness improved by 30 per cent on what the coalition left behind 10 years ago; micro-reform through competition policies and the agenda set by Hilmer, which were adopted by the government and pushed among the states; low inflation and low inflationary expectations; business and consumer confidence at an all time high; and higher productivity and higher real wage outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are things for the opposition to celebrate. The opposition should celebrate this country moving into a period of sustained recovery and sustained prosperity, and acknowledge that the recovery is underpinned by a social safety net&mdash;a safety net made all the more effective by the initiatives released in the white paper Working Nation. The government is doing something that no other government in this country has ever attempted&mdash;to get, on the demand and supply side of the labour market, very important initiatives. On the demand side the government has a very strong agenda for regions to make sure that, as part of economic recovery, they have their chance to participate and share in the jobs and investment that are being created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the supply side of the labour market there are tremendous initiatives to reconnect the long-term unemployed to the work force. The government is not only making long-term unemployed people jobs-ready, it is also making regions that have had higher than average unemployment jobs-available. So it is matching up on both sides of the labour market very important initiatives. All of that, of course, is underpinned by a social safety net: a safety net that the opposition does not believe in&mdash;not in terms of social security policies that provide benefits for the most disadvantaged parts of our society, not in terms of minimum award rates in the industrial relations systems, not in terms of targeted expenditure for quality of life initiatives in rural and regional Australia, and not in terms of having the modern compassionate framework this government has adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the parliament to acknowledge that this is a question of the opposition's frustration about losing an election at the bottom of the business cycle, and about its inability to produce any social policies of note. That goes to the very heart of the philosophies of those on both sides of the House. As a relatively new member, I have picked up that there is a very important philosophical and ideological difference between members in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition believes very strongly that people can advance their interests only at the expense of others; people can get on in our society only at the expense of others. On the Labor Party side, the government side of the House, there is a view that people will always try to advance their interests, but they can do so having good regard in a civilised society for the interests of the less fortunate. That is what this government has been about. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has the view that if we help poor people, the disadvantaged, we drag ourselves down. It is a barbaric and uncompassionate view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had an instance of that philosophy in my by-election campaign in January when the coalition candidate for the seat of Werriwa described some of the suburbs of my electorate as a ghetto. The coalition candidate was not concerned with any solutions to their problems, not concerned with trying to improve the quality of life. He was trying to put labels on particular parts of the electorate. He was looking down his nose at the disadvantaged, trying to talk down to the disadvantaged instead of trying to lift them up and give them a better opportunity in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud to be part of a government that is lifting people up as we recover, dragging them along and giving them better hope and expectations in their life and improving their standard of living. In the context of a growth economy, this government builds on the strength of our social safety net through good policies for our regions&mdash;policies the opposition should be supporting, such as the money that has gone to the Sunraysia and the Goulburn Valley. These are targeted regional initiatives that make a real difference. They help the long-term unemployed whilst maintaining the strength and integrity of the social safety net that is very much a feature of Labor Party politics&mdash;and proudly so. The opposition has no social policy; it has no interest whatsoever in the disadvantaged or the sorts of things it has listed in this matter of public importance. </PARA>

I also agree that the second chamber should not be one that opens and shuts. In continual speeches in the House, I have pointed out that the motions to take note of papers have become a farce. That is probably not because of anyone's determination to make it a farce, but by the reality that important reports and aspects of them that should be given a proper public hearing have been negated by lack of time&mdash;time which the second chamber would certainly provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I chose to participate in this debate to make the point that the motion to take note of the paper which is put by the Leader of the House is one that is made with respect to reports about which honourable members&mdash;Liberal or Labor&mdash;have, from time to time, indicated that they would like further discussion. In that sense, as the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested, there should be some indication from the government that it will create a convention that the opposition of the day will be consulted as to the order of priority or the list of papers that will get on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for the second chamber. It could just be that a very serious report or aspects of a report could come forward which may be embarrassing to a future government.

<PARA>This is a follow-on motion basically related to the creation of the second chamber.

It will, from time to time, enable him to move motions in both places in a fashion that would normally be a power only available to a minister or parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;and I think I have indicated this on a couple of occasions in the past when we have discussed the operations of the second chamber&mdash;has sought to ensure that the operations of the second chamber should be as flexible and open as possible and should not necessarily require the continued activity of ministers or parliamentary secretaries associated with it, and that backbench members of the government and committee chairmen, in particular, we envisage, associated with the House of Representatives committees, should start to use that chamber to the fullest possible extent. So we have given considerable authority in the operations of the chamber to members of parliament in ways that are not necessarily accorded, in practical or in standing order terms, to the operations of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do so partly for convenience. Our ministers and parliamentary secretaries are fully occupied in this chamber and we want to run this other chamber simultaneously with it, at least on a couple of days a week for some hours, and we do not necessarily believe that we have the people available to do the job. But that is a practical consideration. I guess we could always do one or two things about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more important consideration is that, because we would like to see this operating in legislation non-controversially&mdash;that would not necessarily mean that, as it was operating non-controversially, amendments and the like would not be considered&mdash;members of parliament on both sides of the House should be actively encouraged to operate effectively as legislators. If this is to work properly, it will require an enormous amount of diligence by some people who are experienced and, on a day-to-day basis, responsible for the location of members of the various parties. Those people happen to be whips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From talking at least to our whips about the whipping arrangements that are currently associated with the operations of this chamber, the view amongst them is that they do not necessarily have a heck of a lot of spare time, but at least somebody is going to need a fair bit of spare time if this chamber is to be effectively run. Therefore, though it does not require a resolution of the House, I think it would be useful if I informed the House of the government's approach to the question of the whipping arrangements of both sides of the House. Ultimately, how the opposition chooses to respond to what I have to say is a matter for the opposition. But suffice it to say the following things will be on offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I propose that the arrangements for whips to take account of the additional workload be thus: the government to have a chief whip, as described in the motion that is before the House, and two whips. Currently, for example, we have a government whip and a deputy whip. That will give the government effectively three whips, instead of the current two, to operate both the other chamber and this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I propose that the opposition have a senior whip&mdash;senior, chief or however the opposition wish to describe that person. In addition to the senior whip, there should be a Liberal Party whip and a deputy whip, and there should be two National Party whips. Currently, as I understand it, there is a Liberal Party whip and deputy whip and there is a National Party whip. The National Party designates somebody as a deputy whip, but that person is not acknowledged at least by the Remuneration Tribunal. It is intended that all the people I have described be acknowledged by the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be my intention to ask the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), who has responsibility for the government's approaches to the Remuneration Tribunal, to approach the tribunal to request a remuneration arrangement for all of those positions that I have described. I would envisage the outcome for the senior whip on the opposition side and the chief whip to be somewhat in advance of what the Liberal Party whip and the government whip now get, and that the other whips whom I have described should be around the sort of mark that whips currently have assigned to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter I also intend raising with the Minister for Industrial Relations in his approach to the tribunal. I am disappointed in the salary treatment of the Second Deputy Speaker. When we asked for that position to be created, it was our intention that the Second Deputy Speaker should, in terms of his remuneration, be basically the same position as the chap who was in the chair before you, Mr Speaker, got into it. It is a bit of a disappointment that that has not happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these whipping arrangements are absolutely essential if this is to operate effectively. The political parties in this place cannot operate on the basis of the whipping arrangements that they have at this point. Of course, it is a matter for the opposition parties or the opposition collectively to work out exactly where it is that they want to end up. Irrespective of the views that they might hold at this point of time, I intend to approach the Remuneration Tribunal on their behalf, whether they like it or not, and put these propositions to the tribunal for its consideration. </PARA>

I do not know how, if there is the capacity to do that, that person could not do as you suggested he do; that is, be responsible for the day-to-day running of the House. There is an argument that because there is a second chamber a whole lot of additional positions have to be created. I certainly do not believe that the extra expense inevitably involved in this is justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know the history of this. It is to provide a consolation prize for the honourable member for Watson. That is what this is all about. We do not think the honourable member for Watson is deserving of any consolation prize. I know there is a lot of tension about the allocation of these positions within the government, and we are not going to facilitate that. At a time of continued economic stringency, at a time when the public looks askance upon arrangements of this kind, the creation of what appears to the public to be parliamentary sinecures will inevitably draw criticism. I do not think this is a time when the parliament should be embracing that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, it ought to have been the intention of the government to see how the arrangements for the second chamber operate. We cannot dispute the fact that another presiding officer will be needed because there is a second chamber. We cannot dispute that. But we in the coalition parties, for example, now have three people who are officially recognised as whips within the remuneration arrangements and another who does it out of the great commitment that he holds to his party. That is the very charitable honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). We do not see any reason that the duties cannot be spread amongst those people. Certainly from our point of view I see no difficulty, having talked the matter over with the chief opposition whip, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), in doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A prudent, sensible and publicly responsible thing for the government to do at the present time, instead of trying to stitch up something which accommodates one of its disgruntled colleagues, is leave things as they are and see how things work. If there is a demonstrated need after a period of time to come back to this parliament and ask for authority to create these new positions, we might consider it then. But having considered the matter a great deal, we are totally unconvinced of the need for it. It is plainly devised to give to the honourable member for Watson the appearance, the appurtenances and all the facilities of a superwhip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was predicted months ago in the press that the consolation prize for the honourable member was for him to become a superwhip and everything else is meant to accommodate that. We will need to spend a lot more money. The government does not need to have a superwhip. It has parliamentary secretaries coming out of its ears. It has positions galore on committees. Those positions all carry remuneration. The government has within its gift all of these positions that carry remuneration. Why on earth do we want more? How can the government justify that to the Australian public? How can it say that it really needs to create another position?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House knows as well as I do that there are plenty of people on the government back bench who would be very happy to do extra duties in relation to the whipping functions of these chambers, as indeed there are in our party, without any kind of remuneration. Why does the government need the new position? Why can the honourable member for Watson not just have an additional assistant? I am sure that if some unpaid assistants were appointed to the honourable member for Isaacs they would be more than willing to serve in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to delay the House any longer, but I simply say that, having considered this matter, I think this position is unnecessary. It is a waste of money. I do not see why we should spend tens of thousands of dollars to establish a consolation prize for the honourable member for Watson. Plainly, the idea of a superwhip was devised by him after he was rolled from the speakership before the last election. I do not see why the parliament and the long-suffering taxpayers of Australia should underwrite that consolation prize. That is why we will oppose this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a couple of matters of practicality with regard to this proposal. Firstly, I find the duties of the holder of the proposed position totally inconsistent with the role of a whip. Whips, whilst they have a very important role in the parliament, are basically involved with the management of their own party, not the parliament. Their job is to ensure, in the simplest sense, that people appear in the House when needed&mdash;to meet their responsibilities on a speakers list, to vote, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why those responsibilities, which are very specific to the organisation and discipline of a party&mdash;or, if you like, a party machine&mdash;should be extended to include actually putting certain motions to this House. That is properly the role of the Leader of the House or, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) just suggested, possibly a parliamentary secretary to the Leader of the House. Therefore, I cannot understand why, of all the people in this place, a whip would be chosen as the appropriate person to take on that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) argued that the whips will be overworked. It appears to me somewhat strange that we would be putting this extra responsibility on a whip. Clearly, with that responsibility they would be expected to spend even more time in the chamber. One might wonder if it is then suggested that the deputy whip have this responsibility simply because that person might be the one on the telephone. I oppose that concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think the government should review the proposal. If the government believes the Leader of the House is tied to this place too often it can do as it has done when believing that its ministers are tied to this House too often: appoint a parliamentary secretary. There is no cost to the taxpayer in that. The position of whip is already supported by staff persons who from my experience are actually the ones who get on the telephone and say, `Do you realise you are the next speaker?' I seldom get that phone call from the person appointed to the job, who is there to run the office and to see that those sorts of jobs are done by the staff provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the second chamber is operating, the person responsible for watching the television set to see whether the individuals concerned are in the House, as well as doing some secretarial-type work, could without much additional effort switch channels to the other chamber to make the same discovery. As a consequence, the person could pick up the telephone and make that extra call. If everybody had to be called, which would not be the case, it would amount to two calls every 20 minutes. I do not think making one extra call every 20 minutes is beyond the resources or the time available to the employed people who undertake a lot of the day-to-day, even minute-to-minute, functions associated with the operation of a whip's office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House is confronted with the question of whether it is consistent with the operations of this House to give this particular responsibility, the subject of this motion, to a whip. I say that it is not. If, as a consequence of there being a second chamber, we need someone else, it should be a parliamentary secretary. As a shadow minister who has to be on duty in here from time to time, I have already said to the fellow in my office, `We can expect to have our duties doubled as a result of the new chamber.' I have continued to be a proponent of that new chamber, accepting that more of my time will be required for sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I compare the number of ministers and parliamentary secretaries we have now with that which we had not so long ago&mdash;we used to have no parliamentary secretaries&mdash;the servicing of the new chamber in the same way as we service this chamber, in my mind, represents no great problem. I certainly took that into account when I advocated, along with many others, the concept of this second chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to determine whether it is appropriate for a whip to do this particular job. I say that it would be appropriate only for a parliamentary secretary. The Leader of the House raised some matters which he reminded us were not within the competence of this House to decide anyway. I think it is unnecessary to create additional whips at the very best. If we create additional whips, the rules will no doubt provide that they get an additional assistant. I am sure that, if the existing whips got an additional assistant, which would be only part of the cost, all the services of the whips could be provided for. Members of the House should take note of those facts in simple and practical terms. If someone is to replace the Leader of the House, why choose the whip? It is totally inconsistent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am a little disappointed, but not completely surprised, with the opposition's difficulty in handling this. There was a suggestion made, during the remarks of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), that the government had some difficulties arriving at conclusions. I can assure you that we have had no difficulties whatsoever deciding who our various whips ought to be and who the chief whip ought to be. Whether or not the same can be said of the opposition is a matter for its own internal soul-searching. I invite those opposite to continue to do that over the next couple of weeks. After having made their gesture on the subject of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who always seems to exercise a fascination on the opposition benches far more than he does on the government benches, I hope they might see their way, either collectively or severally, to arrive at a different conclusion on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little upset with the view that somehow or other this is an idea of the honourable member for Watson. The honourable member for Watson has many ideas, but this was not one of them; it was mine. It was my idea basically because I think we not only have to give this second chamber the best shot that we possibly can but we also have to change its character somewhat from the operations of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mystery as to why the phraseology of this motion is as it is. It is not that I anticipate that the Chief Government Whip will spend his time in this place operating as a parliamentary secretary or minister&mdash;not at all. But, given that I assume he will be operating in a not dissimilar role in the functioning of the second chamber, he will need to have a capacity to take the odd item that is collectively agreed between our parties out of here and into the other chamber and then to bring it from the other chamber back into here, report on it and all the rest of it. So some sort of facility has to be given to him to operate in that fashion in this chamber. I do not intend to see, and I do not think he would intend to see, that this was in any way, shape or form a regular performance on other matters as far as this chamber was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the honourable member for Watson seems to exercise this fascination on the part of the opposition. I do not think we do ourselves as a parliament all that much credit when we try to score points off each other on these remuneration matters. I do not think you could do other than get plaudits outside for making the sorts of speeches that the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made. There is no doubt that there is a public cynicism, concern or belief that politicians spend a great deal of time trying to work out how we do better out of life than anybody else does. That is a common outside perception. I do not disagree with that. I am sure that, if we were to put this issue to a referendum and the opposition were to take the view that it has, a not dissimilar view would appear in the public in that regard. Every now and then&mdash;very rarely&mdash;we like to hope that we take each other a little bit better than we do when we deal with each other in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We usually do. I have always taken the view that it is not possible in the framework of the Australian constitution for the government whip to be treated in exactly the same way as the whip in the British House of Commons. I realise that from time to time there is some mockery made of me on the grounds that I have some devotion to the nature of the operation of the British House of Commons on the subject of whether we are tugging forelocks or whether we happen to be republican types. To cover myself on that ground, I can say that, at least for a period when Oliver Cromwell ran the majority in parliament, he ran parliament exactly as I thought a parliament ought to be run. He deviated from that very proper course later in life and subsequently developed some very bad habits in Ireland. He went all together wrong, but he started out well. In those days, if people challenged the parliamentary majority, they were shown the business end of a pike. I think that was a very sensible way for parliament, when it got itself into trouble, to conduct its affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of that period, people who organise the affairs of parties have been afforded very high status in the British parliamentary system. There is a huge number of members of parliament in Britain and a huge number of whips. They are all remunerated for the course of their duties. The chief whip on the government side sits in the cabinet and has a house next to the Prime Minister. The chief whip on the opposition side sits in the shadow cabinet. These are positions which are treated with great seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have any problems at all with the view that the government whips and opposition whips who take those tasks upon themselves should be regarded as doing a task which requires additional remuneration. I hope that, in the fullness of time, having made their points here, those opposite will change their minds on that. If they were to change their minds, either severally or collectively, they would not be subject to any mockery from me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get a certain amount of enjoyment when the honourable member for Watson gets kicked up the bracket. He takes it so well. One gets a certain pleasure from observing&mdash;we are all observers of this place; we are not only participants&mdash;the manifestations of outrage, revenge and comeback. The honourable member for Watson is a full-blooded politician when it comes to that. But I do not think it is a very good thing for any political party to sit around making judgment on principle based on what it thinks of any particular incumbent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would probably bet pretty good money that if we were not talking about the honourable member for Watson but, for example, were talking about the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) or the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), who would be the other government whips, then probably this motion would have gone through on the nod. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of money to be made as an issue is derisory in the course of events. All the whips collectively, I doubt, would not come together to constitute anything more than $30,000 or $40,000, and probably less, given the pattern of decisions being taken by the Remuneration Tribunal&mdash;wrongly I might say in relation to the Deputy Speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who should have had a more substantial remuneration than he had. But assuming that, then I would anticipate that it would come out as even less. To make an issue of that when day to day we debate the issues of millions of dollars in this place I do not think is a sensible way to approach it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Construction of 12 staff apartments, and recreation facilities, in the new Australian Embassy complex in Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposal to be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works is for the construction of 12 staff apartments and recreation facilities on the site recently leased in Hanoi by the Australian government. On 24 March the House approved the referral of the proposal to construct a chancery and an ambassador's residence on the site. That referral also noted that future development on the site would include 12 staff apartments and recreation facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 budget process approved the construction of the 12 apartments and the recreation facilities. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works plans to hold a public hearing on 18 May to consider the proposal to construct the chancery and the ambassador's residence. Following the budgetary approval to add the 12 apartments and the recreation facilities to the complex, it is appropriate that the standing committee consider the entire project at the hearing on 18 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main elements of the proposal are a four-level chancery building, including a basement, already referred to the public works committee, a two-level head of mission residence, again already referred to the public works committee, and a three- and five-level residential block including basements, together totalling 12 residential apartments, recreation facilities comprising a swimming pool, multipurpose court and a squash court, and staff and visitor parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated cost of the chancery and head of mission residence is $15.9 million at February 1994 prices. The estimated cost of the staff apartments and the recreation facilities is $7.7 million at March 1994 prices. The total estimated cost of the project is therefore $23.6 million. There will be no impact on the budget as funds from the sale of the properties in Singapore will cover the cost of the project. I table the plans for the proposed work and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the application of this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. Clearly, Australia's relations with Vietnam are significant and growing. It is equally clear that we are part of the region, and we intend to stay there. Therefore, our presence in Hanoi and the capacity for us to have a staff there which is adequately housed is a matter of great importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has been to Hanoi appreciates that conditions there are not easy. It is a city which will go through substantial changes in the next few years with the arrival of substantial foreign funding for investment purposes and for reconstruction and development. In fact, Hanoi is probably the last of the sino pre-European cities, although it has a large component of the French architecture of the late 19th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that the Australian government has retained two of those original French properties, which will be a contribution we will be able to make to the historic or architectural integrity of colonial Hanoi which may otherwise be lost.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point that I would like to make about these proposed clauses concerns the question of a joint venture, which I raised earlier in the debate at the second reading stage. Some concern has been expressed by potential joint venturers on its status. The proposal is to establish a company structure known for the purpose of the exercise as Newco. There were earlier negotiations on the advantages of having a joint venture arrangement, which was clearly to the advantage of people who could see taxation and other differences between the two structures, particularly foreign investors who could clearly see an advantage in a joint venture structure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken advice on this from solicitors and there is clearly a preference, as I said, for the joint venture mechanism rather than the company. The legislation, as it currently stands, however, clearly sets out that it is looking for a company structure, not anything less. This, as I said earlier, raises the question of the singularity or the plurality of the practices as referred to. For example, in subdivision 2 of division 1 of part 2 there is a question of employment by Newco of staff members of the Pipeline Authority. If Newco is to consist of more than one corporation, it is difficult to understand how the employment of employees could be shared unless there are some structural changes to the act. I just draw that to the attention of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know the House is in a rush, but I seek a response to matters regarding proposed new clauses 70 and 135. I will deal first with proposed new clause 70. We know that AGL, the Australian Gas Light Co., has statutory rights under the New South Wales Gas Act so that if under that act there is an application for third party access to the AGL pipeline system then the New South Wales Minister for Energy must take a role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with this clause is that it could put the New South Wales minister in the position of being seen by the Trade Practices Commission, the TPC, to hinder provision of haulage services to a purchaser in New South Wales. Or is the Commonwealth relying on the shield of the crown? In any event, I certainly believe this makes for poor relations between the Commonwealth and New South Wales. It does reinforce the opposition's amendment seeking a review of this legislation when the outcome of the COAG gas arrangements, discussions and national competition policy review is known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to proposed new clause 135. Pursuant to this clause, two parties who agree to gas haulage will not be able to have a legal agreement until the TPC gives its approval. In my view this is a very odd way for any business to be run. If it were to be applied more generally to the gas industry, it would not bring in any new business activity in investment in Australia. It would bring investment down to a much lower level than the government desires in its latest budget. I think it is dangerous to give the Trade Practices Commission this headmaster role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt on any examination that the TPC is given a very intrusive and heavyhanded regulatory role in this bill. It does have new powers. Potential buyers of the 49 per cent of the pipeline yet to be allocated for sale are likely to mark down their bids significantly in light of this somewhat draconian regime. Does the Commonwealth agree it would obtain a better financial result from the sale by simply allowing the industry self-regulatory pipe access code to apply?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am keen to receive assurances from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that the legislation will not be seen as giving a wider role to the TPC on matters of gas pipeline access and regulation in the future. I do not want this to be the model. There are still the COAG protracted discussions to be endured. There must be no intention on the part of the government to extend the powers of the TPC based on the legislation before the House. The regulation of the rest of Australia's gas pipeline system has quite properly been referred to the COAG mechanism, although it should have been done as part of the national competition policy development and not in separate arrangements for gas, along with electricity and water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is not convinced that the TPC is a sufficiently accountable body in this process. Its agency culture tends toward disdain and loftiness&mdash;even to the parliament, on occasions. An example of this is that it distributed draft government amendments to this bill before they were tabled in this House today. More substantively, the TPC's actions over the sale of the South Australian Gas Co. obviously leave much to be desired. The government ought not to assume that the new Australian Competition Commission should simply be an extended TPC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to concede that on gas matters the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) probably is more of an expert than I.

I will try to set his mind at rest on a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding proposed new clause 70, I am assured that there is no attempt to regulate downstream from the pipeline. That is a matter for the New South Wales government, not us. The New South Wales government is relatively happy with that element of the proposition. The matter regarding proposed new clause 135 is specifically related to the vertically integrated effect of the operation of the pipeline. It is a one-off which is related specifically to this pipeline. Neither this clause nor the bill as a whole is intended to reflect ultimately where this thing should go. It is merely a facilitation of the sale. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I welcome the minister's commitment in regard to the government being prepared to entertain joint venturers. I trust that as a matter of some expedition, in view of the lateness of the hour, he will contact all parties who may be interested and inform them of this fact. As I understand it, that is not the case. Some of those based in Australia may now be aware of it from press reports, but overall they certainly are not. The question of joint venturers being allowed to bid may expand the field. In turn, that could be to the benefit of the Commonwealth, because they may be prepared to offer more money. I think that is a worthwhile exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to briefly raise the question of proposed new clause 150 in relation to the closure of the Pipeline Authority. It is noted that, effectively, the Pipeline Authority will be abolished on 31 December 1996. I take that to mean that, if ICI goes ahead, as I understand it probably will, with the construction of a pipeline from Moomba through to Botany for ethane gas using the existing easement, that could still be constructed by the Pipeline Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, one of the advantages&mdash;and my colleagues may disagree with this point&mdash;is that, because it is a Commonwealth authority, it can override state requirements in terms of such matters as environmental impact statements. I raise this as an interesting question which no doubt will be a matter for some further consideration in the future. If the TPA does build it, it will be able to do so on exactly the same grounds as those on which it built the original pipeline. Obviously we will get a pipeline built faster. On the other hand, I am not sure the environmental groups around New South Wales will necessarily welcome it with open arms. No doubt this issue will have to be addressed. Whether or not the TPA builds it will depend on its capacity to offer the best price at the right time. </PARA>

<PARA>Various other points are dealt with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1994-95 budget is the budget that sends Australia backwards. It is a budget that sells Australians short. It shuts out most Australians from sharing in the process of recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that when we strip away the government's words from this budget, we should ask ourselves some basic questions. What do most Australians get from this budget? Do they get tax relief? No. Is there any genuine support for families? No. Is there a break for small business? No. Is there anything for the hard-pressed men and women of rural and regional Australia? No. Do we even get any basic honesty in this budget? No. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a budget in which hard-working Australians foot the bill for the government but do not get to share in any of the benefits of the recovery. If things are as good as the government says they are in its budget document, and given the pain and hardship that has been inflicted on Australians in the worst recession in 60 years, one would have thought the government could have passed something on to the average Australian. In fact, it does not pass on anything to most Australians. Indeed, it ignores most Australians. It clearly makes most Australians worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is not an economic strategy; it was a political exercise for the Labor Party. It is a budget that is far more interested in dealing with one job, and that is saving the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), rather than trying to give hundreds of thousands of Australians their chance for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This budget fits the pattern of so many other Labor budgets. Labor members come in and promise the earth but always fail to deliver. They usually assure everyone that everything is about to be fixed, but then later they are shown to have been hopelessly short of the mark. For example, for the Keating government, budgets are simply a time for slogans, self-promotion, exaggerated claims and propaganda. They are not a time for sensible and honest economic policies in the interests of all Australians and their children. Unfortunately, more often than not, they are simply an opportunity for the Labor government to lie its head off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember very clearly some of the examples from the past. I remember the Prime Minister's words when he was Treasurer. He was always talking about the `golden years' or `bringing home the bacon'. He would also say `It's in the groove', `It's on the mend' and `It's the effervescence in a glass of champagne'. Is it not interesting how all that rhetoric rapidly turned into dust in the worst recession in 60 years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember specifically that in his 1990 budget the Prime Minister assured us that economic policy had worked and was working. It worked all right: it plunged Australians into the worst recession in 60 years. I remember the 1991 budget that promised to create a `sound climate for investor confidence in the coming recovery'. In the months that followed, that sound climate saw investment fall to an all-time historic low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember John Dawkins in 1992 saying that, with his budget, Australia was `once again on the move'. The unemployment numbers did move; they moved up to almost one million after that budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember how in last year's budget Labor assured everyone that its primary objective was jobs. What did we get? We got a green paper, a white paper, a budget and lots of delays, but we did not get any jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, we hoped that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) would give us something different. We thought that with your reputation you would give us something different. But you did not. You got stuck in the same old deceptive Labor groove. You made the same sorts of grandiose claims in the 1994-95 budget as your predecessors, to whom I have referred. Just like other Labor budgets of the past, the claims that you made two nights ago will prove to be just as empty and deceitful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to you, Treasurer, the very first paragraph of your budget speech. I think it sets out very clearly the full extent of the government's deceit, fraudulence and arrogance. You said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget that I present tonight will:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">maximise economic growth;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">promote social justice; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>You also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a budget that seeks to consolidate and improve our economic performance whilst ensuring that all Australians share in the benefits of that progress.</PARA>
<PARA>The corrupting influence of a decade of Labor in power shows right through in that first paragraph. This budget does absolutely none of those things. In fact, it absolutely subverts all of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give some examples. You know to be a fraud the claim that you are going to maximise economic growth. The only thing that will be maximised in your document is your forecast of growth for the next year and the years beyond. How can you talk about a budget that maximises growth when it delivers higher interest rates, higher taxes, higher debt and inadequate flexibility in the workplace and it does nothing about all the inefficiencies of Australian industry in our ports, shipping and transport sectors and other areas of our infrastructure? How will it maximise growth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing in this budget for small business. There is nothing in it for the people in rural and regional Australia who have gone through, and are still going through, very extreme hardship. There is nothing in it to give Australians any incentive to work, save or invest more. That is why boasting about maximising growth is absolute nonsense and you know it. You cannot even look me straight in the eye, and you know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Even if we gave you your 4.5 per cent growth, this talk of maximising growth must be a great big laugh in some of those dynamic countries of Asia of which the Prime Minister is always saying he would like to be a part. They have become used to growth figures of eight to 10 per cent. Countries like Singapore, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and China would never settle for maximum rates of economic growth of 4 1/2 per cent. I put it to you, Treasurer: why should we accept a 4 1/2 per cent maximum rate of growth? The second boast you make in the budget papers is that this will reduce unemployment. You also know that to be a fraud and an empty boast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget shows the real extent to which this government has given up on full employment as distinct from achieving employment. It has given up on generating new long-term jobs for Australians. The most visible example of that is in your own forecasts. I remember in the green paper that it was said you needed 4 3/4 per cent growth in every year to get a five per cent unemployment rate by the end of the decade. What does your budget predict? It predicts 4.5 per cent, 4.25 per cent, four per cent and four per cent&mdash;all figures way below the 4.75 per cent you need to get an unemployment rate of five per cent at the end of the decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of the white paper and the budget was not to generate real jobs. It was about spending some more money on training. Most importantly, it was about fiddling the figures and hiding the full extent of the unemployment rate by moving people out of the unemployment queues and putting them on various government benefits and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the hype about the billions of dollars that you are spending on unemployment, the fact is that by your own figures the real level of unemployment does not move in the course of the year. In this document, you say that unemployment will fall to 9 1/2 per cent by mid-1995. That affects 840,000 Australians. Do you know how you get there? You move 120,000 people out of the unemployment queues and put them on certain benefits and training schemes but you never give them a real job. You just shift them off the queues. Do you know what happens when you add back the 120,000? You end up with an unemployment rate that is higher than the one you started with. You are not creating jobs; you are hiding people from the unemployed. The government is totally in disarray about its commitment in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) started off talking about 1.4 million jobs, then he realised that 1.4 million jobs would not get it to five per cent by the year 2000 so he upped it to two million jobs. The Treasurer at the Press Club yesterday knew, and was honest enough to say, that two million jobs is not achievable, so he said 1 1/2 million jobs. Which is your employment strategy? Is it 1.4 million, 1.5 million, or two million jobs? How are we supposed to know? He said that because he knows you cannot create two million jobs under your policies by the end of this decade. That would be the equivalent of creating two new manufacturing industries in Australia, including all the people who would work there; or five more agricultural industries; or 25 new mining industries. That is why you are not going to create jobs. The stuff about reducing unemployment in this document is all phooey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third boast you make in the budget papers is that you will promote social justice. I reckon you ought to go and tell the one million Australians who have been put out of work by your policies your ideas on social justice. These are very special people for whom your policies do not generate jobs. They do not want special programs from you. They do not want to be classified as social welfare problems. They do not want to be case managed. They are human beings and they want a job, and this budget does not provide it for them. What sort of social justice is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have created a permanent underclass in this country of people who may never get a job and you know it. A lot of young people&mdash;some of whom I have met&mdash;are second generation welfare benefit recipients who have never had a job and whose parents have never had a job. It is a permanent underclass and you know that unemployment has spun-off a host of other social problems like family breakdown, rising crime, health problems, youth homelessness, drug and alcohol abuse, and the loss of dignity. You know that is a problem but you do not even mention it in your budget. You can sit there and joke about it, but we have a permanent underclass with a range of social problems that you have created. I will cite two examples: we have the highest rate of youth suicide in the Western world&mdash;are you proud of that?&mdash;and violent crimes have doubled since you have been in power. They are spin-offs of unemployment. You can boast about social justice to the millions of Australians that you shut out of this recovery!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some social policy measures in this budget that we actually think are important initiatives, and I would like to say a couple of things about them. We welcome increased expenditure on Aboriginal health. So much of the government's increased spending has been allocated not to solve the Aboriginal health problem but to defuse a political issue at least financial cost. What you are on about is not solving problems but defusing issues at least financial cost. That is why you backed off from Graham Richardson's $800 million commitment to Aboriginal health. What did you deliver instead? A lousy $40 million for this year. Unlike the Prime Minister, I have actually seen the magnitude of the Aboriginal health problem by going from one community to the next. It would do him a lot of good to go and have a look. I have seen those problems first hand and the additional money is needed to deal with these problems. But I am concerned that a lot of the money that was supposed to have gone to Aboriginal health in recent years has not gone there so we have not had the sort of improvement we should have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same comment can be made about mental illness. I have campaigned long and hard about getting increased funding and treatment for the mentally ill in this country. I am pleased to see that you have done something about it, but I am not convinced that the way you are doing it and the way you are allocating that money will achieve those ends. Similarly, I welcome the money that has gone into breast cancer&mdash;another area where I have campaigned long and hard for something I believe in. This is an issue my colleagues and I have argued about. You are all Johnny-come-latelys on this issue. I am concerned about some of the arrangements you are going to put in place to deal with it. I wish more money had gone straight into breast cancer research and had been allocated by professionals rather than new foundations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But apart from those three areas that I picked out, your talk about social justice is absolute tripe; it is absolute nonsense. You do not even understand it, judging by the permanent underclass that you have created in this country. Real social justice is about restoring full employment, and you have given up on that. It is about facing head on the root causes of alienation that so many Australians feel today in our society. This budget has nothing to do with social justice and has everything to do with trying to appease particular political interest groups that might have some impact on your key electoral prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also crowed in the third boast in the budget papers that he would reduce the budget deficit. Everybody knows that the number you published of $11.7 billion is fiction. Everybody knows you put in a lot of special factors there to make that look good. It is a total smokescreen. When you add back the fiddles&mdash;the exaggerated growth and trade figures are part of it&mdash;you have one-off asset sales to fund recurrent expenditure, you have a state debt switch, and you have Reserve Bank profits. Your deficit is closer to $18 billion and you know it. You make it look good, you talk about a deficit reduction strategy, but you know damn well you are not on the mark. It is all creative accounting and phoney deficit figures. They are no substitute for the policies that are needed to genuinely lower the deficit, genuinely lower taxes, genuinely lower interest rates and genuinely create more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in the four items you listed at the start of the budget papers, you kept the biggest lie to last: the empty boast that you could do all this without increasing taxes. Do we look like we came down in the last shower? You only ever increase taxes. You have the gall to say that there will be no increases in tax. Let me give you some reminders from your own budget document: personal tax is up eight per cent, tax on superannuation funds is up 27 per cent, tax on fringe benefits is up a whopping 131 per cent&mdash;we know what a classic tax that is&mdash;company tax is up by seven per cent, sales tax is up by eight per cent, and petrol tax is up by 13 per cent. So much for this not increasing taxes nonsense. Six tax rises&mdash;what a fantastic record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has the hide to talk about no tax increases when this budget provides for the biggest increase in taxation revenue in real terms in 10 years. In true Labor style these increases are not up front; they are all hidden. But even though you hide them, Treasurer, Australians know the sting is there. Last year you broke election promises when you hit the Australian public with a raft of new taxes, and those impacts carry through into this year. In fact, there is something like $2.8 billion worth of taxes flowing through from last year's budget impacting on this year. In this budget alone $700 million worth of new tax revenue results from increases in taxes you introduced at the time of the last budget. For example, the duty on tobacco will rise five percentage points on 1 August, and another five on 1 February next year; excise on unleaded petrol will increase by 1c on 1 August and excise on leaded petrol will increase by 2c from the same date; and the sales tax on wine will increase by two percentage points from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Treasurer and the Prime Minister put their hands over their hearts and promise no tax increases, by all means read their lips but if I were you I would watch their hands because they are going to be in your pocket for years to come. But not only that; they have reneged on three important tax promises in this budget. They promised they would hand back bracket creep, but they have not. Bracket creep occurs when everyone's income goes up because of inflation and they are caught in higher tax brackets and end up paying $4 billion to $6 billion in tax. That is the first broken promise. The Prime Minister said he would hand it back; he is not going to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second broken promise was that you would not increase the overall burden of tax. Your own statistics show that you take $4 billion more&mdash;you have increased the overall burden in tax. In the run up to the last election you said you would give an $8 billion tax cut. You delivered part of it and you shifted the rest to the never-never. We know and you know that you will never deliver that other half of the tax cut&mdash;the third broken promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have three broken tax promises on top of a host of tax increases impacting on this budget. So when this budget talks about no increases, nobody in Australia should believe the Prime Minister or the Treasurer. Their own budget shows quite clearly they are not telling the truth. The fact is very simple: when this government comes to its bridges, it double crosses them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are left with is a budget that does nothing for growth. It does nothing to provide incentives for investment and achievement. It does nothing to produce high levels of real interest rates. It does nothing for small businesses which are faced with the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;it sends them running a thousand miles. Any would-be miner would not be interested in operating in Australia after the Mabo legislation. There are massive complexities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company tax, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and a host of other taxes and charges would drive a whole host of investors out of this country. The budget does nothing to keep companies onshore; it does everything to continue to drive them offshore, and as they go offshore so do the jobs go with them. Perhaps most disturbingly, this budget shuts a lot of average Australians out of this recovery process. Most Australians will miss out of this recovery process because this budget shuts them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important in the time I have left to go on and say exactly what I think this budget failed to do in its most important form. This was a very important opportunity for this government to make very real progress, and it did not take that opportunity. It should have done a number of things in this budget which it did not do. For example, it should have put in place a strategy to boost our national savings. It should have contributed directly to that objective by reducing the size of the budget deficit more. It should have changed policies to encourage Australian business to stay here and open here and operate here rather than move offshore and take those jobs with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget should have seized the opportunity that is provided by the strong and unexpected growth to announce a strategy that would ensure that all Australians actually participate in this recovery. Do not leave them out; bring them in. He is always talking about inclusive. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Willis" NAMEID="ZJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister. He could have made this an inclusive budget by offering the right policies to actually solve this problem. It was very important that you announce a strategy that you did not announce. That sort of strategy would have had three key elements to it. First, there would have been a national strategy to boost our national savings. Second, there ought to have been genuine reform of our tax system to offer lower taxes and fairer taxes. Thirdly, we needed policies that eliminate the cost disadvantages of doing business in Australia. Let me be clear and make a few comments on each of those three things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk about a national savings strategy. It ought to be built on a number of foundations. First, it requires a genuine commitment to keep inflation low and a willingness to put the structures and the policies in place to make sure that happens. You have learnt nothing from the past; you have done nothing about that, and we have no confidence in your keeping inflation down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, it requires a reduction in the budget deficit to leave more of our savings in Australia for Australians to invest in Australia. In the budget, for example, you had the opportunity from your start figure of reducing the budget deficit by about $3 1/2 billion because of the growth dividend. You could have had a $3 1/2 billion lower deficit. What did you do? You lowered it by half that amount and you spent the other half of that amount. You frittered it away&mdash;a lost opportunity. You could have gone further. There are plenty of areas in which you could have cut government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at your budget document, I see that you have increased expenditure by $2.4 billion and you make only $700 million worth of savings. Anybody who looks at a $120 billion budget knows there is fat and inefficiency everywhere, particularly under your administration. There are plenty of areas that you could have cut. I defy anybody to tell me they could not find any fat or any inefficiency in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I look at the budget deficit there are some specific programs that I can identify straightaway that could be cut and would save money. First, the Aboriginal land acquisition fund&mdash;$1.4 billion right there. You did not need to do that. We want real improvements in Aboriginal health; we want real improvements in their literacy, their education, their job opportunities. You let that one go. We are spending $1.5 billion that could have been better used. Some of that money could have been better used to genuinely deal with the problem. You know you went way beyond the High Court decision promising the land acquisition fund&mdash;way beyond it. You know that land acquisition and management is a state responsibility. You are getting your dirty Canberra claws on what is otherwise a state responsibility. There is one area where you could have saved $1.4 billion in one hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the public sector, there is something of a blow-out in the running costs under you guys. There is something like a $1 billion increase in the running costs of the public sector since last year's forward estimates. I reckon you could have saved a substantial amount of that. Think back to what you have done to the business community over the last four or five years: you have had it penny-pinching and squeezing and tightening its belt and cutting back on its running costs. If it is good enough for the business community, why is it not good enough for you? You could have easily saved a substantial part of that $1 billion cost. Anyone in business will tell you that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a host of other areas where you could make cuts. There is a lot of duplication between the Commonwealth and the states. You could make cuts there. Just take one example: the federal department of education spends $160 million a year monitoring the programs of the state departments of education and they do not employ any teachers. There is $160 million that could easily be reviewed and reduced. If we go through some of the self-serving expenditure that this government used to look after itself, there are plenty of areas to cut. Let me give a couple of examples in the case of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four hundred thousand dollars has been spent on avoidable expenditure, like carports and drives and billiard tables for the Lodge. You dished out $170 million in consultancy fees. The Department of Social Security spent $800,000 on staff conferences and workshops in areas like Cairns and Magnetic Island. You got $50 million allocated to a program to change the national flag. You could have saved that; nobody is going to go with you. Sixty-five million of taxpayers' money has been put into the trade unions since you came to power, including $14 million last year. Of course, Senator Gareth Evans is having his Taj Mahal built down here which was totally unnecessary, at a cost of about $160 million. It is pretty clear you can cut expenditure; there is fat and inefficiency. Get serious about cutting government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing we need in a national savings strategy is a number of measures to encourage the private sector to save, such as freezing the superannuation guarantee levy and giving people tax breaks, tax incentives and tax concessions to take out superannuation. You can provide tax incentives for short-term savings as well, and tax concessions to part-time and casual people. That is particularly important to a lot of women who are frozen out of the work force for periods of time, mostly because they have families. They ought to be able to get continuity. There are a lot of these changes that can be made to ensure it. You can better target welfare expenditure to encourage greater self-reliance. Those are the essential elements of a national savings strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above that, you should reform the tax system. You should lower tax and streamline tax and simplify tax. Since 1983, the number of pages in tax legislation has increased from 2,731 pages to 6,015 pages. That is an increase of 3,284 pages or 146 per cent. I defy any one of you to be able to explain that to any of us or to the people of Australia. You have got to cut those inefficiencies quite dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the business tax area there is scope for a lot of improvement. A lot of work can be done between the Commonwealth and the states to reform the tax structure. One of the most pressing challenges is to work with the states to phase down payroll tax&mdash;a challenge you should take up if you claim to be genuinely interested in jobs. There is also a labyrinth of regulation and restriction on the business community which can be substantially reduced. The tax system should increase the incentive to work, the incentive to save and the incentive to invest. It ought to be pro business, pro job creation and pro families, and your tax system is not. The capital gains and fringe benefits taxes are a nightmare. They have got to be reformed&mdash;particularly the capital gains tax system for small businesses. If you want them to trade up in their businesses, you have got to change the rules. You have got to give them good value for goodwill and you have got to allow them to use their business as a way of accumulating for retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia also needs to be a more conducive climate for investment. There are a lot of elements to that, but I will be brief. Cutting real interest rates is the first. Real interest rates in Australia are roughly double what they are in the United States for the corporate sector and roughly four times what they are in Japan. That gives you some idea of the magnitude of the task. Of course, there are a host of other reforms on the waterfront, in transport, shipping, communications, all of which add costs and disadvantages to the Australian people and drive business offshore rather than keeping it onshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole industrial relations system which needs to be more flexible. That industrial relations bill of yours ought to be scrapped for the damage it has done. It has taken us back to the 1940s in terms of attitudes in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people deserve much more than this budget delivered. Most Australians&mdash;the people who have suffered under you&mdash;have suffered the hurt of your recession, have been neglected in this budget in what is nothing short of a very cynical political exercise. They are right to feel disappointed that they have been ostracised and left out. </PARA>
