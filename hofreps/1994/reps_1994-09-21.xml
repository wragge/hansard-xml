<PARA>The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill proposes to amend section 6A of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991, the ESOS Act, which relates to the operation of notified trust accounts. The bill proposes to amend subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act to allow regulations to be made which exempt providers, either in whole or in part, from the requirements concerning notified trust accounts under section 6A of the ESOS Act. The amendment will provide more flexible arrangements for the exemption of providers from the requirement to operate a notified trust account. The amendment is intended to strengthen the protection that the ESOS Act offers international students and to ensure the international reputation and growth of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 6A of the ESOS Act currently requires providers who are not exempt from the financial regulations of the ESOS Act to pay into notified trust accounts all prepaid course money received directly or indirectly from overseas students. The ESOS Act also specifies that withdrawals or payments from notified trust accounts may not be made unless they are in accordance with the regulations under the ESOS Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act only allows regulations to be made that exempt providers completely from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. Currently, there is no provision to make regulations for partial exemption of providers from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. The aim of the bill is to amend the regulation making power in section 6A so that regulations can be made that will exempt providers either in whole or in part from the operation of section 6A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ESOS Act was introduced in 1991 to provide both financial protection and quality assurance for international students in Australian institutions. In 1993 the ESOS Act was amended to enhance the quality and integrity of our educational products and to strengthen the protection the act offers to international students' prepaid funds. The ESOS regulations were also amended to include provisions relating to the operation of notified trust accounts and membership of a tuition assurance scheme, TAS, the primary objective of which was to ensure that international students received the education and training for which they paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notified trust account and tuition assurance scheme regulations were subject to a notice of motion of disallowance in the Senate and were then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for consideration. Following that committee's hearing, a package of amendments to the ESOS legislation was proposed in order to address industry concerns about the regulations. This included amending the trust account regulations to meet industry's concerns about agents' commissions and enrolment fees in return for retaining the tuition assurance scheme provisions in a modified form to meet the government's concern for a safety net. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the package, the tuition assurance scheme regulations have been amended without the further need to amend the ESOS Act. Representations from major industry associations to the Department of Employment, Education and Training have indicated their support for these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicated that, in order to amend the trust account regulations, subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS Act would first have to be amended. The bill before parliament therefore seeks to amend the ESOS Act to give effect to the proposals of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to address industry concerns about the trust account regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth of Australia's international education industry depends on the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake and the protection of the monies they invest in receiving an Australian education. The confidence of students is fundamental to the credibility and viability of the industry, which accounts for over $1 billion in export earnings. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 to allow regulations to proceed with regard to draw-down provisions on notified trust accounts for prepaid fees and non-refundable enrolment fees. In December 1993, legislation was passed which required education providers to establish trust accounts for prepaid student fees and to be a member of a tuition assurance scheme. The detail of these schemes was to be provided in regulations which had to be in place by 30 June 1994. The regulations were tabled in parliament on 1 June 1994, less than one month before they were due to come into effect on 30 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In response to massive industry concern, notice was given in the Senate to move to disallow the regulations. These regulations were then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training at the coalition's request. As a result of evidence presented to the committee criticising the regulations as tabled for being unworkable, impractical and unfair, the department agreed to consult again with industry groups. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) announced on 28 June that the government had backed down and reached agreement with the industry. It was proposed that several key changes be drafted to the regulations and the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act. Changes agreed to by the industry and the department which relate to the tuition assurance scheme have been tabled in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This legislation will allow the implementation by further regulation of changes to trust account provisions which have been agreed to by the department and industry. Without the amendments to the original legislation which this bill puts forward, regulations to implement the agreed changes to the trust account reforms would not be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These agreed changes to be implemented by the anticipated regulations will allow for payment of only 80 per cent rather than 100 per cent&mdash;which is required currently by section 6A of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991&mdash;of prepaid tuition fees into trust accounts with current provisions for draw-downs of a further 25 per cent on course commencement and thereafter weekly in arrears. This will take into account common industry practices where offshore agents deduct their 20 per cent commission before forwarding the balance of the student's course fees to the provider in Australia. They will also allow for a non-refundable enrolment fee of no more than $250. This will allow for the payment of administrative costs which are incurred before a student arrives in Australia regardless of whether the student eventually obtains a visa or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original legislation was debated when I was the shadow minister for education. I have to say that the bill as originally presented was a nightmare and required substantial amendment before the coalition would accept it. I said at that time that the bill was then, in its amended form, still only minimally acceptable to the coalition. Then, as now, this was only made possible because of the enormous effort that coalition senators put into examining the original legislation through the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It is largely due to the senators involved that the legislation as it then was lost much of its destructive and disruptive potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the changes were unable to deal with some of the fundamental problems holding back the export of education in Australia. These problems still remain, and they are based on the government's penchant for interference in its pursuit of highly regulatory policies. I will not deny that there is a need for some sort of regulatory framework in this industry; nor would industry participants. The implementation of this framework is what gives cause for concern. Industry and the states and territories have worked to establish an appropriate framework. This government has sought to impose on the industry a cumbersome and excessive regulatory framework in an ad hoc and ill-conceived manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again, regulations and legislation dealing with the provision of education services to overseas students have been brought into this place appallingly drafted, inconsistent and sometimes containing draconian provisions which have caused outrage and outcry on the part of providers. This bill is the result of such an outcry. Its objectives, which we support, are to safeguard the funds that overseas students invest in obtaining an education in Australia and to ensure quality education for overseas students by registering only courses approved by state and territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was brought about after the collapse of a large private college which the Commonwealth was forced to fund at a cost of around $2.2 million. The record of the government in this area has not, I regret to say, improved with time. The government has been trying to catch up with circumstances ever since the late 1980s. In November 1990, almost four years ago, the then minister for education presided over a debacle which left thousands of overseas students stranded in Australia, thousands more overseas awaiting refunds, an industry in chaos and a hard won reputation in tatters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the then minister attempted to take the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill 1990 through the parliament without any consultation with the major players in the education export industry. There was no effective consultation with any of the key providers or industry bodies, such as the Australian Council for Private Education and Training&mdash;ACPET&mdash;the ELICOS Association, universities and TAFEs, the AVCC and state and territory governments. That bill contained many onerous provisions which the providers would never have agreed to. They were not consulted, and they were given no opportunity to voice their opinions and make their disapproval of the government's plans known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be assumed that, as a consequence of these sorry events, the government would have learned its lesson. Sadly, it has not. In June this year, the Senate considered regulations made under the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991. Those regulations contained a tuition assurance proposal which would have placed a great cost on providers and an export disadvantage on the industry. The regulations were, as my colleague Senator Tierney stated in the other place, `incompetently drafted and dangerous in terms of the future of the industry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the deputy chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, Senator Tierney had the opportunity to carefully scrutinise the legislation and the regulations made under it. As a result of the scrutiny of this committee, the government was forced to back away. I regret to say that the opinion of the industry about the department and its officers was not complimentary. The industry has had no confidence in the integrity of the so-called consultation process, nor in the department to abide by negotiated decisions. The Senate standing committee heard the industry and other interested groups at its public hearings. It was clear from the hearings that the regulations were unsatisfactory. This was finally acknowledged by the government when it agreed to go away and further negotiate with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have been a member of this place, I have seen the government build a more and more confusing edifice of regulations and legislation around the export education industry, in spite of which the industry has still grown. Today, it is an industry worth $1.5 billion to Australia. That shows the immense opportunities there are in this area. Had the establishment of the industry not been so appallingly mismanaged, I have no doubt that we would have seen today a much healthier and less regulated industry. The industry has prospered to the extent it has because the coalition has fought to prevent the government from imposing a straitjacket which would have prevented the kind of growth that we have seen. The coalition has also ensured a framework was set up which hampered it much less than that which the government had proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like his predecessors, this minister is moved by ideology not favourable to the development of the industry and is apparently incapable of accepting that this industry can grow sensibly, productively and, to Australia's great benefit, without large scale government intervention. There can be no doubt that some regulation is needed, particularly to protect the fees of students. This regulation, however, must not be at the expense of independence and must not stifle the ability of the colleges involved to become internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever the government has interfered with the private colleges, it has caused great hardship and loss not only to the colleges but to the very people it was purporting to protect&mdash;the students. This minister, like his predecessor, has sought to implement major changes without any real consultation with those who will be affected by this legislation and has sought to do so by stealth. Had it not been for the vigilance of senators in the other place, this bill would never have come into being, and draconian and, to use Senator Tierney's words, dangerous regulations would have resulted in further great losses to Australia not only in terms of export earnings but in terms of the international reputation of this nation through the private providers which Australia has built up in providing excellence in education services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also greatly concerned at the powers granted to the minister to make changes by means of disallowable instrument rather than through legislation. Where changes to the status quo are so significant and will have profound effects in the area sought to be regulated, such changes should be made by means of legislation properly scrutinised and debated in this parliament. The minister has clearly demonstrated the danger of allowing the government to make rules by way of disallowable instruments rather than in the full light of bills properly introduced and debated. The vigilance of the coalition in the Senate prevented a potential disaster. The government, it appears, however, is not prepared to face up to the issues in this industry in an open and fully consultative way and to allow full public debate by introducing legislation as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this bill but puts the government yet again on notice that we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that the exports of education services do not suffer from excessive intervention and regulation. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with 1994-95 budget decisions and other decisions made by the government in respect of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's provisions include an amendment to repayment arrangements for certain students under the higher education contribution scheme, HECS. The measure, which will come into effect on 1 January 1995, will require that people who leave full-time education for the first time have their HECS debt for that financial year calculated on a pro rata basis in accordance with the proportion of the year spent in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This provision, which is estimated to bring forward $15 million in HECS revenue in the period 1995-96 to 1997-98 alone, will shorten the repayment period for affected students without increasing the size of the debt for any person. As importantly, it addresses an anomaly in present HECS repayment arrangements by ensuring consistency with the Income Tax Rates Act 1986, which prorates the standard tax-free threshold for people who leave full-time education for the first time. It should be noted that, as these arrangements apply only to persons leaving full-time education from 1 January 1995, few people will be affected by the changes in the 1994-1995 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend section 17 to increase the amount of maximum grant available for operating purposes in 1993 as well as transfer funds from the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for appropriation under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. However, the total amount provided by the Commonwealth to institutions for operating purposes has not changed. Although the total amount legislated under section 17 has increased, this is offset by a corresponding decrease in the amount provided to institutions from the HECS trust account. The variation reflects a lower than anticipated Commonwealth contribution required to discharge student liabilities in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the act put forward in this bill include minor modifications to the open learning deferred payments scheme. These amendments will clarify some operational characteristics of the scheme. In particular, they will remove the current restriction on the number of units for which an eligible client may defer payment in the first semester to allow students to defer payment for up to a maximum of eight study units for any two consecutive semesters. Further, the amendments will clarify that the amount of basic charge payable by students under the open learning deferred payments scheme for a study unit in the December-March semester is the amount payable for study units in the following semesters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill seeks to amend the definition of `overseas student'. Currently, members of certain foreign armed forces who enter Australia in the course of their duties are considered under the act to be HECS liable students. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs treats these members of the armed forces as temporary residents. For consistency, it is more appropriate that these individuals are regarded as full fee-paying students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes a range of provisions to correct anomalies in previous amendments to the act which are of a technical nature and should be rectified so that a consolidated version of the act can be printed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to implement a number of changes announced in the budget. In particular, it changes repayment arrangements for certain higher education contribution scheme students, varies the level of grants funding for certain higher education institutions, clarifies provisions relating to the open learning deferred payments scheme and makes other amendments of an administrative nature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 of this bill, which seeks to introduce a pro rata HECS threshold for students who cease full-time study and enter into the work force for the first time, is, in our view, a most unsatisfactory clause. It introduces a range of complex provisions into the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, the sole purpose of which, as is clearly stated in the explanatory memorandum, is to bring forward revenue for the Commonwealth of $5 million a year from those least likely to be able to afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993-94 budget the government, with the agreement of students, announced that students repaying HECS debts would pay through the PAYE tax system rather than through the previous arrangement, which was for students to pay a lump sum at the end of each financial year if their earnings were above the specified HECS threshold. At present, the threshold is set at average weekly earnings; that is $26,402. Debtors repay their HECS debt at the rate of three per cent of their taxable income from this threshold to $30,004. Those with taxable incomes of $30,005 to $42,005 repay their debt at a rate of four per cent and those with incomes over $42,005 repay the debt at five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to repayment through the PAYE system means that HECS debtors will have their contributions deducted from their wages by their employers on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. Those earning a gross wage of $507.75 per week or more will have HECS contributions deducted. If at the end of the financial year that person has not earned more than the threshold amounts, any overpayment will be returned to them by the Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment proposed by clause 12 of the bill will allow HECS repayments to be calculated on a pro rata basis in the year of income in which a person first ceases full-time education. In other words, people who are entering the work force for the first time after completing their studies will pay a HECS contribution for the period during which they are in the work force. Therefore, a graduate who earns $15,000 between 1 January and 30 June will be required to repay their HECS debt at the same rate as someone earning $30,000 per annum. This means that the government has effectively lowered the HECS threshold to well below the yearly average weekly earnings level, despite its rhetoric that students would not pay until they were earning at least the average weekly earnings level. Yet another promise broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is particularly concerned that this legislation will be used as a precedent for further changes to apply pro rata HECS payments across the board to anyone who has a HECS debt, which includes students in part-time or casual employment or unemployed people who secure short-term work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is ignoring the problems of low income earners, treating them merely as an additional source of revenue&mdash;revenue which they will receive at some time but which they want now. The bringing forward of such a small amount of revenue&mdash;$5 million per annum&mdash;is hitting people least likely to be able to afford it. Many students leaving full-time education for the first time often have large debts to repay as a result of having studied for several years with no real income. The proposal is inequitable and unfair to these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system of pro rata is inequitable as it relates to the time frame in which money is earned rather than total annual earnings. A student earning $5,000 over two months who earns nothing else for the rest of the year will be required to repay part of his or her debt. A student earning the same amount over the whole year would not have to repay anything. This clause requires the application of a complicated formula, including a people's status in regard to full-time education, the number of months and partial months that they have been out of full-time education and their income before and after they found employment, all in order to determine whether or not they must repay HECS at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government deliberately misled students when it transferred the collection of HECS to the PAYE tax system. At that time it made no suggestion that a lowering of the repayment threshold would be a part of this change. This clause merely represents a grab by a desperate government for revenue in the short term, regardless of the consequences. It is harsh, inequitable and unnecessarily complicated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will oppose this particular provision on the basis that, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, it is inequitable and unfair to students who are low income earners. Many of these students will carry large debts from their years in higher education and will then be preyed upon by the government to provide additional revenue for a period of months, because the government accepts the fact that if the student's income for the year does not reach the threshold that money will be repaid. But for the time that money is in the hands of the tax office, the government will be reaping the interest payments from it and the benefits of having that money in hand. At the same time, the students who may well be  earning way below the threshold will lose that income, and thereby their financial burdens will be increased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government made no suggestion whatever, when it moved the HECS repayments into the PAYE tax system, that any measure of this kind was contemplated. Australian students are now in a position to see exactly the worth of the government's word. The students can also take note of, and perhaps be alarmed by, the fact that we have a government with massive financing problems that is desperately in need of revenue and that may resort to any measure to raise extra revenue, even for a relatively brief period, from people who can ill afford to provide that revenue: namely, students who have largely given up their income earning capacity for a number of years in order to improve their qualifications. Therefore, it is a matter that the coalition feels strongly about. We do not believe that this measure is justified or appropriate. We believe that the interests of students in this matter need to be defended. We propose to do that by opposing this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The higher education contribution scheme, HECS as it is known, is a source of much confusion and concern for both students and parents alike. It has also been a source of embarrassment for the government which, only after much prodding by the coalition, students and community groups, was last year forced to drop the proposed double HECS charge for students studying for a second degree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today will, in essence, introduce a pro rata HECS payment which will only add to the confusion and concern. This measure comes on top of the annual indexation which has seen HECS indebtedness for the average full-time course load rise from $1,993 in 1991 to $2,355 in 1994. Not only that but the government, despite the soothing messages in its August 1993 budget and a nominal reduction in the threshold from $27,748 to $26,402, raised the rate of repayment from two, three and four per cent to three, four and five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill affects persons leaving full-time education for the first time by calculating the HECS repayment on a pro rata or proportionate basis, depending on their time in the work force. Presently, a HECS debt does not have to be repaid until a yearly income threshold&mdash;currently $26,402&mdash;has been reached. But, under the government's proposed pro rata system contained in this bill, that threshold will effectively be lowered, as the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) explained in his speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure is clearly unfair, as it is an impost on first-time graduates which will essentially bring forward a payment of $5 million in HECS revenue per year from a group of people who can ill afford it: graduates who are already faced with a very difficult employment environment, the legacy of this government, and who are desperately trying to establish themselves after several years of being students with little or no income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not take account of the fact that many students after three, four or five years study come out into the work force pretty well strapped for cash, possibly having borrowed off parents and friends to get through that last year. They come out not having a wardrobe to wear to commence work. In many instances, depending on where they get employment, they have to buy a little car. However, the very first thing the government does to them in this first six months of employment&mdash;and in most instances that is when HECS will affect these students&mdash;is to deprive them of that little bit of income which would get them on their feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the collection of HECS by the PAYE system was supported by student bodies at the time of the August budget, and while I respect their view, I have some serious misgivings about PAYE collection. I recognise that on the surface it is a simple mechanism of collection, but I echo the misgiving which the coalition had at the time that it shifts the emphasis of the payment from being a debt to a tax&mdash;and therein lies the ability to expand that tax, as the member for Goldstein has pointed out. It is a bit like a hole in the dyke: at this stage it is only a trickle, but it might easily become a flood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some other silly aspects of this bill. For example, even a student who is paying PAYE tax and has a glitch in his income, perhaps from fruit picking over the holidays, will pay a HECS collection payment. If during the rest of the year he does not bring his income up to the $24,602, at the end of the year he will subsequently find that he has to claim that money back. He is being deprived of the use of that money during the year&mdash;again, something that students cannot very easily cope with. I support the honourable member for Goldstein in this matter. I think the whole range of measures brought forward by the government in this bill has not been thought through. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 in accordance with Commonwealth government responsibilities in respect of providing benefits to students within Australian higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the continued support of existing student services within Australian higher education institutions through an amendment to the act which will allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly and recover funds from the states' general revenue assistance if necessary. The bill will also allow the Commonwealth to make payments to student organisations directly for certain permitted purposes. The recovery of funds will be possible under the provision contained in section 15 of the States Grants (General Purpose) Bill 1994. This mechanism ensures that there will be no additional budgetary implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions contained in the bill will override the provisions of any state law or any other action the state may take to the contrary. The amendment is a direct result of the Tertiary Education (Amendment) Act 1994 passed by the Victorian government and the actions of the Tasmanian state government towards the University of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian act purports to abolish compulsory student unionism while protecting the provision of specified services to students. While the provisions of this act were being debated in the Legislative Assembly, amendments were made, after considerable pressure from the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the National Union of Students, to increase the range of services funded from non-academic fees. While the Victorian minister may add to the list of approved services by regulation, there is a danger that the list specified by regulation will limit the services and amenities available to students. For example, a number of activities and services such as student newspapers, student advocacy and general activities of a representational nature will not be provided for. The Victorian act also places restrictions on the use of profits from activities funded from the compulsory non-academic fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the Victorian government has legislated against student organisations, the Tasmanian government has used the Victorian act as a precedent to exert pressure on the University of Tasmania to conform to state government demands. The University of Tasmania has agreed to amend the university ordinances relating to the payment and use of fees for student association membership at the university. All students will continue to pay a compulsory student association fee but students who object to their funds being directed to the Student Representative Council, SRC, will have their fee dedicated to the provision of student services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally the role of the SRC has been important in meeting a range of non-academic needs of students on campus. The Commonwealth government will challenge the state governments to protect the rights of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action taken by the Tasmanian and Victorian governments has the potential to affect the culture and quality of services and amenities at universities. Their intervention is a direct attack on the autonomy of higher education institutions. Institutions and student organisations should jointly be able to make decisions about the imposition, collection and use of fees for the provision of services and amenities, independent of government interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By restricting students' expression of views on public issues, the Victorian government has cynically flouted the international instruments and principles which it had originally claimed to be the basis of its legislative action. Making the expenditure of fees levied by the institution dependent upon state governments' views of what is `appropriate' effectively amounts to the choking of open debate of government policies as they affect the institution and the student body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value and need for compulsory student unionism has been endorsed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and student organisations around Australia. This principle is in accordance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, article 22, concerning freedom of association. Furthermore, most if not all institutions allow for conscientious objection to the membership of student organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian act prohibits the acceptance by universities of financial assistance from the Commonwealth for a student organisation as a result of the state preventing or hindering the imposition or collection of fees, a provision currently contained within section 25A of the act. This amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 will allow the Commonwealth to make payments directly to student organisations for the purpose of enabling those organisations to continue to provide `benefits' to students and maintain funding support at a viable level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, through this amendment, will ensure that institutions maintain an environment that fosters the necessary culture and atmosphere for students to exchange ideas and hold and express opinions in a free and unimpeded manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in opposition to the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill represents yet another stage in a four-year battle by the government to defend its policy of compulsory student unionism. Over those four years the government has been plagued by its continuing failure to introduce workable legislation which achieves this policy. These failures represent more than poor drafting on the part of the government. They have much more to do with the indefensible nature of the changes it wishes to make and the government's resulting failure to justify them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the government introduced the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill which, if enacted, would have allowed the Minister for Employment, Education and Training to compensate student unions for revenues lost as a result of state legislation upholding voluntary membership of those unions. These funds would be paid by the Commonwealth, which in turn would recoup these moneys from the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After much debate, this bill failed to pass the other chamber and became one of only two pieces of legislation defeated by the parliament in that year. It signified the overall failure of the government, I have to say, in education and capped off a miserable year for the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins. While the bill was reintroduced and passed in 1992, it remained an embarrassment for the government, which lacked any mandate from those affected by the bill&mdash;that is, the students themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current bill is, in these respects, no different from its immediate predecessors. It is part of the confusion and failure which characterises the government's response to the issue. Its purpose is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to allow direct payment of funds to universities from the federal government. This reverses the current situation where funds are passed to universities on the condition that they will be forwarded to the student unions. This subtle change is a direct response to some clever drafting by the Victorian government in section 12J of its voluntary student unionism legislation which prevents universities from forwarding the funds to student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of this bill has been to establish a scheme which penalises state governments for protecting students' freedom to join or not to join a student union. The scheme is driven by the basest of political motives and the self-interest of the government. It is a scheme which discriminates between states on the basis of their respective policies. In just 55 lines of statute, the entire shabby approach of the government is fully exposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite decisively, this bill speaks volumes about the lack of principle of the current government. After spending years promoting the flawed cause of compulsory unionism and criticising coalition intentions to dismantle it, this bill actually stops short of a commitment to that policy. It does not enforce compulsory membership of students, which will soon be voluntary in three Australian states, nor does it force students to fund student unions, and by doing so associate themselves with those unions against their will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government has had some time to take action on its policy of compulsory student unionism, its failure to act is effectively the end of the debate. The coalition's long held belief has borne fruit and the intellectual battle has been won. The bill is a huge defeat for the government. A decisive victory in the battle against compulsory unionism has been struck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not about compulsory student unionism as such. It is not about enforcing universal membership or promoting student involvement in union affairs. Given that the Victorian VSU legislation maintains funding to a range of useful student services, it is not even about protecting the provision of services at universities. This bill results from another concern of this government, not one related to the public interest or to the welfare of students. In short, it is about protecting the supply of funds to Labor's student union mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since unions were formed at universities, political interests have been involved in the running and controlling of these organisations. Over the years, members of both sides of this House have been involved in this process. However, on this side, we have taken the principled stand that neither students nor anyone else should be forced to fund or join these unions. The government, however, lacks the same principle and has chosen through this bill to introduce a substitute funding source for unions. When students choose not to fund the government's mates, this government will come to their aid with taxpayers' money. It will bail them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, this bill allows the government to fund the wages of dozens of members of the Australian Labor Party working in student unions. It will also fund the activities and campaigns run by the National Union of Students to the tune of an estimated $400,000 per annum, since the union receives affiliation fees from publicly funded student unions. A repeat of the last federal election will see the National Union of Students spend $100,000 of these funds on a `Put the Liberals last' campaign. One can be sure that the officials of the National Union of Students and their Labor predecessors in this parliament will ensure similar spending patterns in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the minister might be satisfied by this outcome, he should not forgot that under this bill he must allocate funding to student unions in response to state reforms in favour of voluntary student unionism. Such political funding does not flow automatically. Instead, it is at the discretion of the minister whether he bestows financial favours upon his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We well remember the last minister who used her discretion to allocate Commonwealth money. That minister was the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), who no longer appears on camera behind the government speaker at question time. In her case, two-thirds of the discretionary funding went to either mates or marginal electorates. That was enough to earn her the title of the `Minister for Sports Rorts', and it forced her to resign in disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case a similar kind of accountability is going to arise. Indeed, the allocations of grants under this bill will make the sports rorts affair look timid by comparison. Consider the following: one of the largest student union beneficiaries of the minister's grants would be the Monash University student union, which is geographically located on the border of the minister's Hotham electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with its 1994 budget, the Monash union could receive a grant for its political activities of more than half a million dollars per annum&mdash;that is possibly more than any single grant handed out by Mrs Kelly. The minister might also be pleased to discover that, just last week, two Labor students were elected editors of the student newspaper at Monash University, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lot's Wife</EMPHASIS>. Subject to the vote being declared, they not only will have the potential to influence the votes of the many students residing in Hotham during 1995 but also will each receive wages of more than $11,000&mdash;which will most likely be paid by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister might like to explain, in the course of this debate, exactly how he intends to justify such a payment and the dozens of other payments which will result in money going into the hands of his young Labor friends. There is no justification for these potential payments&mdash;just excuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is anathema to all Australians' sense of decency and fairness. I have no doubt that it will result in a massive backlash against the government. The Australian people did not tolerate the original sports rorts episode. They will not tolerate its sequel&mdash;a sequel which might be described as `Unigate', after another incident in which government was caught red-handedly abusing its powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The political nature of the grants is not the only way in which this bill shows disrespect for all Australians. The fact that the funds transferred to student unions come originally from state funds has severe consequences for taxpayers in those states which decide to uphold student rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State taxpayers will be forced to fund unions which students refuse to join. As a result, the money available for other state services&mdash;hospitals, ambulances, police and schools&mdash;will be reduced. This threatens the quality and the availability of services for the residents of the states. In other words, the minister will be proposing to prefer his party mates to the sick, to those who are threatened with violence and to those who are seeking help in a variety of ways from their state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's priority is clear: money will be taken out of state coffers and given to the Labor Party's friends in the student unions. This is unlikely to be of great concern to the federal government, which continues to squeeze the state's capacity to provide these services in a variety of ways. This bill makes it clear that the government's objective&mdash;to fund student unions rather than other state services&mdash;is going to be fulfilled at the expense of the rest of the citizens of the states, who seek to guarantee the human rights of students to voluntary association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also represents an intrusion into the democratic processes of the states. At the last Victorian state election, the state coalition committed itself to a policy of voluntary student unionism in its tertiary education and training policy `Education for Life'. The now Victorian government stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition will ensure that compulsory unionism is not forced on students in higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>This policy, together with others outlined in that campaign, was accepted by a massive majority of the Victorian public. In contrast, this Labor government failed to put any policy on student unionism to the Australian people at the last federal election. This suggests that the government is well aware of the overwhelming opposition of Australians to compulsory unionism and that any move to protect its mates must be made away from the public eye. It also explains why this bill is being introduced well before the government will next face the voters and why we are unlikely to see a budget allocating funds under this bill anywhere near the time of the next election. This government has quietly sought to override the mandate of a state government by adopting opposing policies which lack electoral approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also affects the states by forcing their taxpayers to fund, and therefore to indirectly associate with, the political activities of student unionists. The federal government is threatening to subject Victorians, Western Australians and Tasmanians to a form of state sponsored breaching of their freedom of association. Instead of their funds being used to provide services which serve the public interest, taxpayers will be forced to make private grants to assist with the training of politically active student unionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be particularly offensive to students in  part-time employment. In many cases, these students will have opted not to join or fund the student union because they cannot make use of any of its activities. However, this bill will force them to contribute financially to those student unions. If indications of student opinion are any guide, a majority of students may be in such a position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the Melbourne University student union commissioned Student Services Australia to conduct a poll of students. The majority of students who expressed an opinion indicated support for the concept of freedom of association at tertiary institutions. The representative nature of this poll was demonstrated another two times in Victoria. Over a period of four days earlier this year, 3,000 first-year university students, constituting 10 per cent of all first-year enrollees, signed a petition calling for voluntary unionism in Victoria. That is a significant result, given the resource limitations on the petitioners. In the only referendum on voluntary student unionism in Victoria, the majority of voting students at the Rusden campus of Deakin University supported the state government's legislative moves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, this bill is a symbol of the lack of respect that the government has for the opinions of young Australians. Not content for them to live their lives according to their own political consciences, this government will decide which political causes warrant the financial support of students. In this case, the training of its political youth movement takes priority. The government's agenda of monopolising public institutions in this country is what matters above all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another offensive feature of this bill is that it rewards the poorest performing student unions the most. Unions whose services are not geared to the needs of students and which suffer a drop in membership as a result will receive the highest government grants. The danger of this system is immediately apparent. While most sectors of the economy&mdash;such as the transport, telecommunications and electricity sectors&mdash;are boosting their efficiency and consumer focus, the government is encouraging the opposite within student unions. This bill makes a mockery of the government's commitment to principles of competition reform and its accompanying emphasis on efficiency. It protects the monopoly position of student unions, even when a union is failing the students that it is supposed to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation threatens to undo 20 years of slow improvement in student unions leading to modern-day voluntary unionism reforms. Under pressure from the prospect of voluntary unionism, compulsory student unions in the late 1980s and in the 1990s moderated to some extent their political activities. They understood, at least in part, that their legitimacy rested on the perception that they were providing services for students. For example, the student union changed greatly during my 10 years as professor of politics at the Monash University. During that time, in a notable incident, I witnessed the destruction of a student union department designed exclusively to fund marginal off-campus political causes. While student unions could and should perform better, there has been some progress, particularly where radicals have been voted from office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, this bill provides student unions with a positive incentive to turn back the clock to the darker days of the early 1980s. It replaces student accountability with no accountability. The government does not care how much shortfall in revenue the unions experience as a result of decreasing membership and poor performance. The bill provides a blank cheque to failing unions. The government has made it clear that the most successful union is not the one that attracts the most members; it is the one that spends its time delivering partisan political messages rather than providing valuable student services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Membership will become incidental and even irrelevant to a union's pursuit of its objectives. The government is saying to its political mates, `Play your games. Ignore the interests of students if you wish. We will pick up the tab if students then refuse to join you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential reliance of student unions on government funds has met with mixed reactions within the unions. Many have privately expressed grave concerns about the implications of this legislation on the independence and integrity of their institutions. For instance, will those Labor dominated student unions which oppose the government's changes to HECS or Austudy be able to represent their constituents effectively? The minister's discretion under this bill to make payments or not make payments to these unions could very easily be used as a bargaining chip to ensure the silence of student unions on such matters. Not only would this put the independence of student unions at risk; it could also lead to further student disenchantment with their unions, reductions in membership and ever greater union reliance on the government's payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This vicious downward cycle, which will doubtless be known as the Crean effect, promises to destroy the very unions which the government claims to be protecting. It will make a mockery of student unions' claims that they represent students and further erode the participation of young Australians in the policy making process. It will be quite clear that a union dependent on a grant given to it at the minister's discretion is representing the government, which is prepared to make these payments to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the bill's outline, the minister claims that the state government legislation for voluntary unionism `amounts to the choking of open debate on government policies as they affect unionism and the institution and the student body'. What a joke! These are prophetic but misguided words. Whereas state governments are introducing freedoms and giving students more independence, the federal government is denying students an effective and independent voice in public affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This attack on the autonomy of student organisations and on the rights of students to control their own organisation, to exercise their human rights to join or not join an association and to engage in free debate untrammelled by the aspect of financial pressure from the federal government can be seen as an extension of the federal government's approach to higher education generally. All the rhetoric that we hear from the other side of the House about the autonomy of universities meant absolutely nought when the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Dawkins, established the national unified system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All universities were brought into the unified system under the administration of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Their autonomy meant nothing to this government. The only time we hear the government defending the autonomy of the universities is when it thinks this phrase can be used as a screen to defend the rights of its student union mates. This is the only occasion we hear the government defending the autonomy of the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The autonomy of the states to make their own laws under the democratic actions of the people of those states also means nothing to this government where it believes that it can advance its own political objectives. So the government's claims to be interested in the autonomy of student organisations must be seen for what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is one of the most offensive pieces of legislation introduced by the government. It denigrates students who refuse to join a student union by making their decision irrelevant to the operation of the student union. It penalises taxpayers in the states which introduced voluntary student unionism by making them pay for student unions. Ironically, it threatens the viability, independence and integrity of the unions themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It puts the minister at risk. I give this advice on the matter to the minister: he should think very carefully about the position which this legislation creates for him. It puts the minister directly in a situation where, through his discretion, he will decide whether hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money will be given to his political mates on campus. It will be his discretion. As I have said, we saw what happened to a minister who decided to allocate large sums of taxpayers' money in the sports rorts affair. This legislation puts the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, right up there in the public eye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the coalition will endeavour to ensure that the parliament will scrutinise very closely every grant to student unions made under this legislation. We will give these grants a great deal of publicity as they flow through. These grants overrule the decision of students that they are not prepared to support and fund these organisations. The only thing that remains is for the minister to decide whether he is committed enough to this bill to exercise his discretion. Go ahead, minister. Make our day. </PARA>

Despite the fact that Labor has been in office for 11 years federally and has done a wide range of things in the higher education area&mdash;many of them have been quite controversial and opposed by Labor and left wing students on campuses&mdash;the Liberals have still been unable to win any serious support in student union elections across the country.

That conference cost roughly 2c per student and was one of the major so-called crimes committed by the Student Representative Council in Melbourne University at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are basically the only serious examples that have ever been produced of alleged misuse of students' money, and they have been struck down in the courts. Robert Clark took the Melbourne University SRC to court and relied upon the provision in the legislation and the constitution of the SRC, which required it to spend money only for the direct benefit of students. Those provisions are virtually uniform across the country so, to the best of my knowledge, all student unions are restrained by those or equivalent words in what they can do: they can spend money only for the direct benefit of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the honourable member for Goldstein today did not repeat some of the ludicrous nonsense that the honourable member for O'Connor put forward. There is an enormous amount of mythology on this issue and very little substance indeed. Student unions have not funded terrorists. In fact, elections at student unions are almost invariably very heavily contested. They involve candidates from right across the political spectrum. They involve candidates who are not particularly interested in the mainstream political spectrum or even mainstream politics at all. In the 1970s, there were a number of deficiencies in how student unions were structured. For example, the way that delegates were elected to the annual council of the Australian Union of Students was, on many smaller campuses, clearly undemocratic. There was pressure brought to bear; campaigns from the right of the political spectrum within the student movement were ultimately responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those inadequacies were fixed up. Gradually, the student unions did lift their game and some of the features that were common in the 1970s were removed. There is no doubt that elections which now occur are democratically conducted and that there is a supervisory responsibility on the part of the university administration and the university visitor or its equivalent&mdash;the institution that is enacted in state legislation to ensure that the conduct of campus affairs is right and proper for people to pursue complaints if there has been some form of electoral misbehaviour or the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to correct the honourable member for Goldstein on one matter. Although it is obviously a bit out of date, I participated in a referendum at Melbourne University on the question of compulsory student unionism in about 1981. That referendum, with a substantial turnout, voted two to one in favour of compulsory student unionism. There has been a subsequent referendum&mdash;I cannot recall the year&mdash;which delivered a similar result. It is true that in recent times the only referendum that has occurred on a campus in Victoria has been at Rusden, where the vote for voluntary student unionism was about 280 and the vote against was about 260. This was out of the thousands and thousands of students in Victoria, and was hardly a representative indication of what the student opinion really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of prominent Liberals have launched their careers and, indeed, made their careers on the back of this issue. In the late 1970s, Michael Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) managed to win a considerable amount of glory in the ranks of the Liberal Party by being seen to take on the evil forces of the ultra Left in the student movement. It is even reported in the media now that they won great victories. This is an extraordinary rewriting of history because, had they won great victories, we would not be debating this bill now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, they did not win great victories. To the best of my knowledge, Michael Kroger never won a serious student election and the honourable member for Higgins won a term or two as the chairperson of the Monash Association of Students. They led an attempt to establish an alternative organisation to the National Union of Students called the National Association of Students, and the honourable member for Higgins was the prime mover in that attempt. From memory, that attempt lasted about six months, from 1979 to 1980, and then fizzled. So, in a direct sense, people such as Robert Clark, Michael Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins received a great deal of kudos within the Liberal Party and a good boost for their own careers but, in a practical sense, failed to achieve their objective, which was to destroy compulsory student unionism. Of course, they are still pursuing that objective with an equivalent amount of success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian legislation is nothing like voluntary student unionism. The first draft of the Kennett legislation provided for a compulsory fee still to be levied on students by universities to provide for non-academic services but for there no longer to be any form of membership or rights associated with membership. Therefore, students were going to be subject to a form of taxation without representation. The university would still levy a fee to cover a wide range of non-academic activities and the students would lose the right to elect their own representatives to control the expenditure of that fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a wide range of absurdities built into the legislative structure. Sport would continue to be compulsorily funded but culture and theatre would not. Universities would have to tender out services, so not only would students be denied the right to elect representatives to control the money that they were contributing but universities would have to tender out services and student unions would be artificially hampered in their ability to compete in those tenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide range of cultural activities in which university campuses have been the crucible of Australian talent&mdash;such as the arts, theatre, comedy and music&mdash;would be excluded whereas, as I said, sport would not be excluded. There was an enormous protest against this, predominantly from people who are not involved in politics but who are amongst the most prominent in Australian art, theatre, music and the like. This included such notables as Steve Vizard, who I understand is being touted as one of the many possibilities for the seat of Kooyong and whose potential candidacy has been made to appear quite respectable by some of the other candidates who have started to surface. So there have been substantial protests against the initial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government then had a bit of a change of heart and reviewed it even further. The amended legislation now allows for the compulsory funding of cultural activities. The main things that now can no longer be funded by compulsory fees are clubs and societies and student newspapers. We have the absurd situation where the debating society at Melbourne University can still be funded via compulsorily levied student fees but other cultural societies cannot. The overseas student service advocacy functions can still be funded by compulsory fees&mdash;including from people who are not overseas students&mdash;whereas other advocacy services cannot. Student radio and television can be funded by compulsory fees but student newspapers cannot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation where, in practice, the great assault on compulsory student unionism that the Victorian Liberal government has entered into is, in fact, nothing of the sort. What in effect it has chosen to do is sustain those parts of non-academic campus activities which are funded by the student levy, to sustain those parts to which it does not really object&mdash;which is about 90 to 95 per cent of the total of student union activity&mdash;and to target directly the bits that it does object to. Why does it object to them? Because, more often than not, those forms of activity involve political expression which is contrary to the position of the Liberal Party&mdash;not always, but more often than not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we now have the absurd situation where we have these great defenders of freedom, these great supporters of freedom of association out there in the public domain saying, `Well, yes, we support freedom of association and the right to choose. At the moment, you have to pay $300 or $350 for non-academic purposes to join the Melbourne University student union which provides the services. We are going to relieve you of this incredible burden. We'll still slug you for the fee and we'll still have that money being spent for almost all of the same services, but you will lose your right to decide through your elected representatives how that fee is going to be spent. We will have a situation where there is no structure of membership for the student union related to that fee.' So, in effect, you end up with the worst of both worlds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the honourable member for Goldstein did not say very much about the Victorian legislation. If he is honest I think he would be embarrassed by it because it is a million miles away from voluntary student unionism. It is a quarter-way house which is designed to extract the bits of student union activity that the Liberal Party objects to for political reasons and to hit them&mdash;for example, student newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have made much of the analogy with trade unions in this debate. Student unions have some similarity with trade unions, but not many. I am in a reasonable position to know. I have worked in student unions and I have been a trade union official. The advocacy role representing the broad interests of members certainly bears a similarity. But equally student unions have a lot in common with local government because, like local government, student unions exist to serve a defined constituency. A student union at Melbourne University serves a larger constituency than some of the recently abolished local councils. It serves a larger constituency than some councils that will continue to be in existence in rural areas in Victoria. They provide, in many respects, similar services to local government&mdash;perhaps not the same making of roads, collecting of rubbish and so forth, but a variety of other services that are all part of providing localised services to assist a specifically defined community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay rates like, presumably, the bulk of everybody else in this place. At the moment I do not use my local swimming pool very much. There are a variety of other things in my local municipality that I do not use at all, yet I am helping to pay for them. The argument that I should not have to do that, that I should be able to opt out, that I should be able to voluntarily seek not to participate in my local municipality, is roughly equivalent to the argument that I should be able to go to Melbourne University yet not participate in the provision of services of a broad nature, of a non-academic nature, on that campus. Sure, student unions are not precisely the same as local government, but I would suggest that they bear as much resemblance to local government as they do to trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument of freedom of association that we have heard is hypocritical nonsense. Student unions are, in effect, an integral part of campuses of universities&mdash;institutions to which admission is voluntary. Nobody in Australia is forced to go to a university. It is a bit like saying that you are compulsorily required to join the department of history if you want to study history at Melbourne University. We have a recent opinion from Alan Goldberg QC advising that the current arrangements with respect to so-called compulsory student unionism do not breach international law with respect to freedom of association&mdash;the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights freedom of association provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might well ask: who is this Alan Goldberg? Some left wing lawyer who used to be a student union official? No, he is not. Alan Goldberg, much to the interest of the media, I suspect, if the media knew about it, was the person who won the Dollar Sweets case. He was the person whose bags were carried by the honourable member for Higgins and whose success in that case has been lived off by the honourable member for Higgins ever since. He was the person who was out there defending, supposedly, the rights of small employers against unionists&mdash;hardly somebody who would approach an issue of this nature with great bias. He has also been the president of the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties. So it is an opinion, I would suggest to those on the other side, that should be treated with some respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the comments that the honourable member for Goldstein made. I found it amusing that he defines this legislation put forward by the government as a victory for voluntary student unionism. Maybe he is one of the small group in the Liberal Party who think they won the 1993 election or some of the others who think that Alexander Downer is doing a great job and that his poll levels at the moment are really good. It is an interesting new concept of victory. He also complained about the National Union of Students contributing funds to election campaign activity last year. That has not been typical. There have been some elections where the National Union of Students or its equivalent predecessor, the Australian Union of Students, contributed little or nothing in the election campaign activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might well ask: why did the National Union of Students put in so much effort last year? The answer is the education policy that the honourable member for Goldstein was responsible for. He was the reason. Because he put forward the most extreme, the most inequitable, the most favourable to the rich education policy that has been seen in higher education debate in this country for many years, the National Union of Students got very active in that election campaign. So if the honourable member for Goldstein wants to complain about that perhaps he should look at his own policies because they were what triggered the involvement of the National Union of Students. In the past the National Union of Students and AUS before it have been extremely critical of Labor governments and have campaigned against them on issues like HECS, amalgamations and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted also his interesting comments about the notion of the mandate. The Liberal Party are pretty funny on this notion of the mandate. When it is a Labor government that has a long, detailed set of policies and there is a particular policy that it is seeking to implement which has not been a highlighted issue in the election campaign, the Liberal Party says, `No, you have not got a mandate to do that.' The Whitlam government had numerous items of legislation rejected or threatened in the Senate, national compensation and national superannuation, for example, which were part of the platform it went to the electorate with in 1972 and 1974. According to the Liberal Party that was not a mandate. But when we had an issue which was completely inconsequential in the election campaign in 1992 in Victoria, the Kennett government had a mandate for that. The Kennett government also had a mandate that no worker would be worse off in Victoria. Subsequent events have started to illustrate what that mandate means for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are dealing with here is essentially a politically motivated debate. The Liberal Party has been unable to control student unions. Student unions are a source of dissent to governments like the Kennett government. They are a source of dissent to the types of policies that people like the honourable member for Goldstein would like to impose on the Australian people and on higher education. They want to stifle that dissent. That is the motivation behind their position on these issues. That is the reason why they oppose this legislation. That is the reason why governments like the Kennett government are putting such bizarre legislation into place. It is to stifle dissent on campuses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the last state election the Western Australian state coalition made it perfectly clear that it would introduce legislation to make membership of student unions voluntary. That legislation was introduced last year amid threats from then education Minister Beazley that if the Western Australian education minister went ahead with his proposed legislation the federal government would introduce legislation penalising the states the equivalent amount to that lost by student guilds who lost income caused by voluntary membership to student unions. The threats made by Minister Beazley, which have since been carried out, are anathema to democracy and are pure and simple standover  tactics by a minister not unfamiliar with such tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act to make provision for Commonwealth grants to student unions for circumstances where a state government takes action to implement voluntary student unionism and the student union loses members as a result and therefore loses income. The states grants bill recently passed in this place provides for the Commonwealth to recoup any moneys paid for this purpose from the states general purposes grants. I must say how ironic it is that the federal Labor Party is claiming that it is overriding the Tasmanian government's homosexual laws under the banner of providing freedom of choice for individuals but, when a state government does likewise for tertiary students who are old enough and smart enough to make decisions for themselves, the feds override those states by saying students do not deserve free choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, in conjunction with the states grants bill, is aimed at forcing Australian taxpayers to fund student services and activities which students do not wish to fund themselves. I will make a number of points on this, but the basic fact is that membership to any organisation, including student unions, should be voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the education policy of the Western Australian coalition&mdash;I realise that this legislation will impact on other states, but as a Western Australian I have a vested interest in the impact it has on my own state&mdash;released well before the last state election, states unequivocally that a coalition government would make membership of student guilds voluntary. The Western Australian government therefore has a mandate to introduce its legislation without any threats, standover tactics or overriding by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In overriding the Western Australian legislation, the Labor government is undermining the will of the people of Western Australia, who endorsed the coalition and its policies, including its promise to bring in voluntary student unionism. The Victorian and Tasmanian governments made similar commitments prior to their elections and also have a similar mandate to introduce their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Australian taxpayers should not be paying for student political activities which students have deliberately chosen not to pay for themselves. If students deem the activities of the student union to be unworthy of their support, it is wrong for the federal government to legislate for the Australian taxpayer to fund those activities which students have deliberately chosen not to fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have before us legislation which does not actually specify how much money, if the bill is eventually passed, this will cost the taxpayer. It could be $3 million; it could be $20 million. We do not know; the government does not know. Whatever it costs, that will be lost by the relevant states in states grants. Consequently, those states will lose out on roads, schools, hospitals and other more essential services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of how the Labor Party describes this bill, the thrust of this legislation coupled with the states grants bill is to punish states for providing freedom of choice for students. In the event of states providing students with the basic right to make decisions for themselves, the federal government has introduced this legislation to guarantee the income of student guilds at the expense of essential services to the relevant states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the state governments of Victoria, Tasmania and, of course, Western Australia are trying to enshrine the freedom of the individual in legislation by providing for freedom of association at our universities, the Labor Party is implicit in its intentions to restrict the freedom of students by forcing students to join the guild. If the Labor Party could have its way, it would have students who chose not to join their student union kicked out of the university. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that each of the governments in the three states I have mentioned has introduced a different form of voluntary membership. Victoria has outlawed a compulsory fee for political activities but has maintained a compulsory amenities fee to cover such things as food, child care and cultural activities. The Western Australian government makes membership completely voluntary and the Tasmanian government has come to an agreement with its university whereby students must pay a set compulsory fee, but the student may choose whether to pay all of this to student services or direct some to the political activities of the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of the format of their legislation, the states all provide voluntary membership in particular to the political activities of the student unions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no denying that the Labor Party uses student unions as a training ground. Over the years we have seen many former guild presidents end up in this place or in cushy positions in the trade union movement or the Labor Party. Even in this parliament there are many members opposite who carried out their political apprenticeship in a student union or guild. The federal government is introducing this legislation to protect its training ground and it is using taxpayers' money to train its future movers and shakers. By protecting the student unions, the Labor government is ensuring taxpayers' funds are used to promote its own cause. In relation to levels of corruption, this is more blatant and therefore worse than the misuse of funds we saw in the sports rorts affairs under the then minister for the environment, sport and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add that it is not just the political activities that are offensive to many students. Student guilds have had no trouble in offending other groups. I cite some examples. A few years ago the student newspaper at Curtin University in Western Australia, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grok</EMPHASIS>, published a number of what it called jokes which were plainly sick and most offensive to spastics, those with Down Syndrome and disabled people.

It is not up to the federal government to give student unions money which they lost through being unable to attract membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example comes from the front page of the April edition of the Edith Cowan University newspaper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harambee</EMPHASIS>, which features a sexually grotesque effigy of Christ.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might argue in both these cases that the editors of the student trash are entitled to freedom of speech, but that should only be available if students can similarly choose not to fund the publication of things like this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that certain state governments have rectified that situation, the federal government, knowing that student unions are so unrepresentative they cannot attract members, have introduced this legislation to guarantee the income of the student unions. This bill ensures that student unions remain unrepresentative, politically partisan and unattractive to join. With a guaranteed income, there is no way the unions will act in students' interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a corrupt bill. Like the sports rorts affair and the massive grants to Labor's mates in the trade union movement, this bill steals money off taxpayers and gives it to student unions which, at the end of the day, are using the money for anti-Liberal and pro-Labor purposes. It cares little for the rights of students. It ignores the fact that the states have a mandate to introduce voluntary student unionism. It cares little for the people of the states who will have less funding for roads, schools and hospitals, which is from where the money will be redirected to pay for the student political activity; and, finally, it ignores the fact that the vast majority of students care little for their student union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Students are old enough and intelligent enough to make decisions for themselves. The legislation of the relevant state governments provides for students to make their own decisions, including whether or not they shall join their campus student union. The legislation of the states was intended to make the student unions accountable and answerable to the student population. The legislation was designed to make student unions representative, hard working, attractive and worth joining. If the unions were none of these, students would not have joined. This legislation, by guaranteeing their income, allows student unions to ignore their members, knowing full well that even if they turn members off and lose them they will not lose a cent of funding. We could have a situation where a student union could give half its money to the League of Rights and it would not lose a cent of income from students withdrawing their membership. That is a complete and utter farce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill does not restrict students' abilities to make their own decisions, if students choose not to join their student union, for whatever reason, the government pays the shortfall and the relevant states lose the equivalent of what the government pays in lieu of students not joining the student union. For example, if a student decides not to join a student union because they do not use any of the outlets provided by the union or the guild, and they oppose the political activities of the union, then the union will not suffer. Student unions will not be forced to change their ways to attract members. They will not be forced to alter their policies to encompass the attitudes of all students. They will simply take money which should have gone to their states' essential services and waste it on their blatant political partisan activities. </PARA>

Because students will always voice their point of view publicly, and often very well, and because they are primarily opposed to the nonsense that the opposition comes up with, the opposition wants to get rid of student guilds. That is why the Victorian government tried to abolish student guilds in Victorian tertiary institutions. The evidence is very clear. For example, a Victorian Liberal Party education policy committee has stated on the record:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I wonder what members of the Liberal Party and National Party opposite would say if the majority of students on Australian tertiary campuses supported the Liberal Party. Would we see such legislation in Western Australia and Victoria if they believed there was political advantage in having those guilds? Of course we would not. That is the sheer hypocrisy of what people in the opposition parties are saying here today. </PARA>

By any stretch of the imagination we cannot call them unions in the normal sense of the word. So let us not get carried away by unions.

Is anyone on the opposition side going to suggest that David Penington is a supporter of the Labor Party? I would certainly like to hear someone from the coalition suggest that he supports the Australian Labor Party, because I can tell you he does not. What did David Penington state? `Absolutely crazy.' The stated position of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on the Victorian and Western Australian legislation is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the prerogative of universities to determine conditions of enrolment. The Vice-Chancellors have stated . . . that student organisations not only provide essential services and facilities but also are an important element in the social and cultural aspects of universities and are part of the education process . . . In addition to catering for the welfare of students while they are enrolled at University, student organisations encourage a broad range of activities by funding diverse groups ranging from religious societies to faculty associations to debating clubs. Participation in these activities is educational in the broadest of senses&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I say again, `educational in the broadest of senses'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">encouraging students to develop their social skills. Student organisations also promote a wide range of sporting activities and provide recreational facilities for the student community. It is essential that the student organisations continue to contribute to the ethos of universities in this way. To do so however, they must have adequate funds at their disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>Shortly after the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee issued that statement Professor Penington attacked the Victorian government over the legislation. Professor Penington called it intrusive, absurd, and said it undermined university cultural life and autonomy. In typical Kennett fashion the Victorian government refused to consult and refused to agree. We get used to that down there&mdash;what Kennett says goes; there is a one man government in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an amazing amount of pressure&mdash;not from Labor Party people, I might add&mdash;the Victorian government made a minor amendment to the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Stirling made some comments about the lack of interest of students in these organisations. Around 80 per cent of Australian public universities are affiliated with the National Union of Students, representing about 400,000 of the 575,000 students attending higher education institutions. Affiliation is consequent upon a majority vote in three-day referenda on the constituent campuses. Did you hear that? Referenda. Vote. The students voted to belong to the National Union of Students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand we are being told that this compulsion is not desired, that it is anti-democratic, yet on the other hand the opposition would remove the financial capacity of students to be involved in those democratic processes.

We do not expect them, frankly, to change. This legislation is desirable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since I was elected to this House in March 1993, few pieces of government legislation have struck me as being as cynical as the legislation we are debating today. Many pieces have struck me as lacking in commonsense&mdash;indeed, many of the government's legislative efforts have struck me as being hopelessly misguided&mdash;but few have struck me as being as cynical, as calculated to win votes, regardless of the costs, as the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill being debated today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no mistake: this bill represents a cynical political manoeuvre. It is framed to serve the government's interests, not student interests, and no amount of government rhetoric can disguise this fact. This bill will put in place a mechanism which allows the Commonwealth government to directly fund student unions in those states where student union membership has been made voluntary. What an extraordinary act of generosity! It is an extraordinary act of generosity because this bill could potentially translate into Commonwealth government outlays of many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not heard members of the government talk about the potential dimensions of its generosity. Perhaps they have been overcome by modesty. Stranger things have happened. It could fall to the coalition to do so for them. Let us look at how much money the Commonwealth government may be up for in the case of a single university that is affected by VSU legislation. Even making the conservative assumption that the university in question has about 20,000 students, and assuming that this university has previously charged a student union membership fee of $200&mdash;again, this is a conservative figure&mdash;the Commonwealth could potentially be obliged to direct up to $4 million to the university's student union. As I have said, $4 million to a single student union is extraordinarily generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am in awe of the government's generosity, may I ask where this money is coming from? My apologies if this question makes the government a little uncomfortable. How does the government intend to fund its generosity? In fact, the money the government intends to give to student unions will simply be recovered from the grants paid to state governments&mdash;grants that, in part, are used by state governments to provide funding to universities. And herein lies the gross cynicism of this bill. The money that the Labor government will give to student unions will be taken from Commonwealth grants to the states. The states provide funds to universities, despite what has been said by the previous speaker, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, the state government provides in excess of $2 million to our three universities. Clearly, a state's ability to maintain this funding will be significantly limited when the Commonwealth government deducts student union running costs from general purpose grants to the states. Ultimately, the funds the Commonwealth government will so generously be providing to student unions will reduce the amount of funds that state governments can direct to universities&mdash;funds that universities rely on to maintain their services to students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the government is redirecting funds from universities to student unions, and the standard of education that students receive will suffer accordingly. If this government were truly committed to the welfare of students, it would not be introducing legislation which will ultimately reduce the level of government funding received by universities, and it would certainly not be doing so at a time when universities are in a state of crisis from inadequate funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what the previous speaker had to say, the university system under Labor has undergone a massive upheaval. The number of students in higher education leapt by 64 per cent in the 10 years between 1982 and 1992. In itself, the opening up of universities to more Australians was a good thing. However, unaccompanied by any real Commonwealth government commitment to maintaining educational standards, it has been a disaster. During 10 years of Labor rule, funding per full-time student has dropped by 15.2 per cent&mdash;a dramatic decline in funding that has created a state of crisis in our university system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of Labor's lack of vision, student-staff ratios have increased to the point where tutorials now resemble mini-lectures rather than the personalised discussions that they are meant to be. Student services such as libraries and study skills courses are being continually cut back. Students are being asked to pay additional fees. In my electorate, science students at the University of Adelaide are being asked to pay 10c for every glass slide that they use in the course of their studies. Last year, the Adelaide university was forced to raise $400,000 from students in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian universities are already struggling to maintain their standards, and they cannot afford this legislation. The funding they will lose when the Commonwealth government redirects state grants towards student unions will simply exacerbate the already critical funding situation. Surely this begs the question: if the government is so concerned about the welfare of Australian university students, why has it drafted a piece of legislation that will further reduce the level of funding received by Australia's cash strapped universities? Why has it drafted a piece of legislation that will potentially result in worse student-teacher ratio numbers, fewer student services and more fees? Does it have anything to do with the fact that voluntary student unionism jeopardises the future of the National Union of Students, a union which had sufficient funds to run a $100,000 campaign during the last election&mdash;a campaign with the pro-Labor message of `Put the coalition last'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have rarely seen such cynical legislation. This legislation is to be condemned on many grounds. The manner in which this legislation invades an area of state responsibility is one such ground. Whatever the relative merits of voluntary and compulsory student unionism, the Commonwealth has no right to intervene in what is an area of state responsibility. The question of whether student union fees are to be paid as a condition of enrolment is a question relating to the governance of universities. Since universities are organisations incorporated under state acts of parliament, the Commonwealth has no business interfering in their operations. The way in which they operate is a matter for the state governments, and the issue of voluntary student unionism is to be decided by each state separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Commonwealth to interfere in what is clearly an area of state responsibility is to fly in the face of the spirit of our federal system of government&mdash;a system that exists to check the rise of centralised power, a system that Labor seems to have little respect for. It is up to each state and every state government to address the issue of VSU individually. Victoria has implemented VSU legislation, after taking this policy to the Victorian people at the last state election. Victorians made a decision that compulsory student unionism had to be reformed within their state and, in consequence, students at universities in Victoria now voluntarily join their student union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, a state which was bankrupted under Labor, the Liberal state government has listened to the people of South Australia and has found that there is no mandate for VSU legislation. It is right for South Australia to come to that decision. The issue of VSU is not a matter to be decided by federal parliamentarians, and this legislation should not pass through this parliament for that reason. Since the issue of VSU is not a matter for federal parliamentarians, it is not for me to say whether I support or oppose VSU. However, I have no hesitation in saying that I believe student unions are an essential part of student university life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it will no doubt upset members opposite, I have regular contact with the student representatives in my own electorate, and I think it has been a productive relationship. For my part, I certainly appreciate the access to student concerns that the relationship provides. Having benefited from my contact with student unions, I am particularly concerned about the impact that this bill will have on the autonomy and, ultimately, the integrity of these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In states which have VSU legislation in place, the independence of student unions is not threatened. Although Labor is given to peddling the simplistic view that VSU legislation is designed to destroy student unions, in reality this could not be further from the truth. Under VSU legislation, there is the potential for student unions to be re-energised by a membership which is no longer forced to join but which has chosen to join. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the future for a student union which acquires its funds from the Commonwealth is grim. Ideally, a union has no allegiance other than to its membership. Thus, a union defends its members' interests against any and all who threaten those interests. At times, and I suggest we are now in one of those times, students' interests may be threatened by the Commonwealth government. If a student union receives its funding from the Commonwealth government, can it realistically be expected to criticise the government? Of course not. You do not bite the hand that feeds you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government's legislation will have a far more destructive impact on student unions than any pro-VSU state government could come up with. With this legislation, Labor will ensure that student unions will be in the pocket of the Commonwealth government of the day. I understand that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has given assurances to student unions that any funding they will receive will be untied. If I were a member of a student union, I would be feeling just a little nervous about that particular promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is unusually loose. Decisions about whether a union receives Commonwealth funding are largely up to the discretion of the minister, and they are reviewable. I cannot help but wonder how the minister might apply his discretion if he realised the money he would be providing to student unions was soon to be used to run a `put Labor last' campaign during the next election. I would suggest that the instincts for survival might come into play. Not only will the autonomy of student unions be jeopardised by this legislation; at the same time the membership of those unions will be decimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's legislation would put in place very solid disincentives for students at universities affected by VSU legislation to pay membership fees to a union. Obviously, if you are a young student struggling to find money to pay for textbooks, you will not take up membership of a student union if you know that without your membership fee your union will survive on Commonwealth funds. In this way, the government's bill will act as a disincentive for students to join their student union. Student unions will be empty shells and the Commonwealth government will have destroyed the student union movement it purports to defend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this debate, government members have put up a concerted effort to portray themselves as the defenders of students' welfare, as fearless crusaders for the students of Australia. However, if it were not for the efforts of the coalition since the last election, Australian students would now be struggling under the weight of a HECS regime in which tuition fees for students who took longer to finish their courses would have increased by 50 per cent and in which fees payable for second degrees would have increased by 100 per cent. The changes that the Labor government attempted to put in place last year were totally unacceptable, and the attack on students continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the House has debated government legislation which seeks to extract earlier payments of HECS from students who work for part of the year after they first leave full-time study. The government has attempted to defend this change saying it is a logical extension of the pro rata changes it introduced earlier this year. All I can say is that students should watch out for further logical extensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition which is defending, and will continue to defend, student interest and it is the government which poses the threat to these interests. The legislation we are debating today should be seen as an attempt to obscure this fact. I cannot support the government's Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill. Despite the rhetoric, this bill does not serve the interests of Australian university students. It is a cynical, political act by a government whose focus is firmly fixed on the next election. </PARA>

<PARA>The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who was the federal Deputy Leader of the Opposition and education spokesman, lauded the state legislation. He stated:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary student unionism will have a disproportionately negative impact on female students. Voluntary student unionism is an attempt to privatise student organisations and to establish a system of "user pays".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will hit female students in two main ways. First, women are economically worse off than their male counterparts. Second, women both within and beyond the education system are discriminated against in society.</PARA>

<PARA>A lot of the services that are set up by the student unions are directed straight towards looking after the needs of female students. Some of the areas of service that will be lost if student unions do not have these funds are a personal accident insurance scheme, a union minibus, union recreation services, entertainment, publications, clubs and societies. It is very important that people going through university&mdash;I imagine it is; as I have said, I have not been there&mdash;mix with others and during those formative years come to their own points of view. It is important for them to be exposed to all types of views. If this funding were not to be available and were cut down by Jeffrey Kennett and his cohorts, those sorts of things would cease and one point of view would be put; and that point of view, no doubt, would be the Liberal Party's point of view, whatever it is these days&mdash;one cannot find out what it is. Mr Haddon Storey, the Victorian minister, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 11 May 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . has dismissed as "emotive" comments by the vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, Professor David Penington, that voluntary student unionism legislation could seriously damage universities.</PARA>
<PARA>As the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) said, Professor Penington is certainly no friend of the Labor Party, but Professor Penington has gone through university and he can see the advantages of free speech. He can see that students take advantage of all these various clubs, activities, child care and other facilities and publications that are supplied by the student union. I do not know what Professor Penington is supporting&mdash;who knows what he is supporting&mdash;but I believe that he thinks what Jeffrey Kennett and other conservative state Premiers are trying to do is completely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have an article that is of the opinion that the union bill will kill off campus newspapers. I spoke about those publications just a minute ago. They are very important. We may not agree with what they say&mdash;we may not agree with 90 per cent or 100 per cent of what they say&mdash;but to actually stop their publication, which the state legislation is about, is returning us to Nazi Germany where the authorities burnt the books. This is the same sort of thing. If we do not have that freedom of speech, how will information be disseminated?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campus of Monash University is in my electorate. A few weeks ago I met with the deputy president of the Monash University student union, Mr Jason Rogers, and discussed the legislation with him. Mr Rogers represents 10,000 students at Peninsula and Caulfield campuses. He said that, within the 10,000 people on the campuses, there was strong opposition to the state government's Tertiary Education (Amendment) Bill. He also stated that he was pleased that some of the university vice-chancellors were coming out and also opposing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things the state bill relates to is fundraising. The Monash University student union has been attempting to raise $2 million towards a $5 million amenities building for students on the Peninsula campus. The building, which is to be funded by the federal government, will house a cafeteria service, gymnasium, lounge and other services. The federal government is putting in $3 million and the student union $2 million. What for? For the benefit of those people who use the university. It is not for the benefit of members of the Labor Party who happen to be on the campus at the time. I am quite certain they will use it, but so will members of the Liberal Party who happen to be on that campus. It will be there for all students to use. That project would be jeopardised were this state legislation to be imposed on the students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rogers has said that the state government's proposed banning of fees for campus activities would have, in effect, removed many services enjoyed by students. He said that the result would have been that many of the present services provided by the union would have been taken over by fast food outlets. McDonald's, instead of the unions, would have been looking after the campuses. We only have to look at what has happened with Victorian hospitals. McDonald's is in the children's hospital. Various fast food chains have gone on to secondary college campuses, all with the blessing of Mr Hayward and Mr Kennett. One wonders who the McDonald's franchisees are who get contracts to go into these areas. I could not put this situation better than it has been put by Rebecca Peniston-Bird in two articles appearing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. The first article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student unions exist to serve and promote the interests of all students. Fees aside, there is one student voice and that voice is legitimate because it is accessible to all students via the democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA>The second article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of universal membership of student unions say their emphasis is on the principle involved&mdash;freedom of association, or non-compulsory levies&mdash;but all they ever talk about is how much they dislike the actual student bodies concerned. This freedom of association line is simply used to mask the fact that it's not our existence that offends the Liberal governments, but our politics.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it boils down to. Liberal governments do not mind the student unions; they just do not like the politics of the people involved. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student associations have opposed Liberal and Labor higher education policies because both parties want higher fees and lower living allowances for students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crucial feature of student associations that has marked them off for destruction is that Liberal students don't often get elected on campuses, not just in Victoria, but across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps it is the Government's position that if Liberal club students do not have control of student affairs, then democracy is no longer viable.</PARA>
<PARA>Rebecca Peniston-Bird has put the argument quite succinctly. Kennett wants to cut down the student unions because the Liberals cannot get control of them. They cannot have a say. One remembers that, when the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was at university, the Liberals tried to get control of the student unions. I do not know whether they did. I think Mr Kroger and the honourable member for Higgins were involved in a fight over this matter at Monash many years ago. I did not go there; I just recall that there was a bit of talk about it. The whole history of this matter was outlined on a page in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lot's Wife</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberals thought that now that Jeffrey was in power they might be able to get control of student unions. They will not. Until the Liberal Party gets itself together, until it gets a few policies and puts them to students, it will never get control of student unions. That is what the Liberal Party does not like, and that is why it is trying to stifle that voice&mdash;a voice of democracy. We may not all agree with that voice, but it must be heard. </PARA>

It is expensive in terms of the amounts of money that will be inflicted on taxpayers.

There is no argument which would support answering that question in the affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994 is yet another example of Labor's outrageous double standards and its lack of concern for basic human rights when these rights conflict with the doctrinaire interests of the Australian Labor Party. The bill seeks to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, the principal act, to make provision for the Commonwealth to directly fund student unions or guilds for the loss of compulsory membership fees in circumstances where a state takes, or has taken, action to implement voluntary student unionism. The bill will also allow the Commonwealth to make direct payments to student organisations for certain undisclosed, permitted purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A corresponding clause in the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994, which was introduced into the House on 29 June this year and debated earlier, will allow the Commonwealth to recover any moneys paid to student organisations for this purpose from the states general purpose grants. This bill represents an attempt by Labor to entrench compulsory student unionism within the ethos of Australian higher education institutions through the provision of direct taxpayer funding to student organisations and through the thuggery of federal financial coercion of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it bluntly, this bill seeks to override the legitimate and democratic legislation in Victoria and Western Australia and to override proposed steps towards the introduction of similar legislation by the Tasmanian government. It concerns me and many on this side of the House that the operation of this bill effectively limits those rights that all fair-minded Australians have come to expect: the basic rights of freedom of choice and freedom of association. This is the reason the coalition opposes this bill. There are other reasons, which I will touch upon later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Fraser government, such basic rights were acknowledged and protected in the form of the Australian National University Amendment Act 1979 and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Act 1979. These pieces of legislation ensured that membership of student organisations was made voluntary, that the fees payable for membership of student organisations was made voluntary and that compulsory fees could be levied only for the provision of amenities and services. Where the council of the university or college made compulsory fees money available to a student organisation for the provision of approved services or amenities, the council had first to be satisfied that the governing body of that organisation was representative of its members, and it then had to ensure that money was applied only for the provision of amenities and services that were not of an academic nature and were of direct benefit to the university. That is the record of the coalition and the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as ensuring a student's basic right to freedom of association, the Fraser government recognised and respected the sovereignty of the states and did not attempt to use the states grants legislation to force state government action on this issue. That coalition government limited itself merely to recommending that the states follow the Commonwealth's lead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In contrast to this entirely reasonable and sensible approach, let us reflect on Labor's illustrious history on compulsory student unionism. The Labor Party has a shameful record of enforcing the undemocratic and unrepresentative policy of compulsory membership of, and payment of fees to, student organisations and unions. In January 1982, the then shadow minister for education, Mr John Dawkins, indicated that Labor would `act to ensure the autonomy of student unions'. In reality, this meant that Labor would force all tertiary students to become members of a political student union and to provide financial support to that union in the form of the payment of compulsory fees. The payment of those fees would become a precondition to their receiving education, regardless of whether they wanted to become members of a student union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the Hawke government legislated to remove the fair and equitable controls on student union fees that were introduced by the Fraser government and that were to apply to higher education institutions in the Australian Capital Territory. Under the Fraser government, accountability and responsibility were fostered and encouraged. The Hawke government ensured the demise of efficient and representative student organisations that were accountable to individual students. But that was only the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, after initial indications from the Victorian and Western Australian state governments that they would be legislating to outlaw compulsory student union fees, the Keating government amended the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to ensure that institutions would receive funds to pass on to student organisations if they were prevented from collecting compulsory fees by lawful state government action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1993 was then passed. Section 20 of the act enables the Commonwealth to recoup from the states any money paid by the Commonwealth for the purpose of funding student organisations. That legislation was also introduced in response to proposals from the Victorian and Western Australian state governments to outlaw compulsory student fees. Not only is the amendment a complete abuse of state responsibilities; it also sets an ugly precedent because it overrules state sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill before us, which is the proverbial icing on the cake. But why the fuss? Why put so much effort into circumventing state attempts to give university students the right to choose whether or not to join a union, guild, organisation or whatever else one chooses to call the current student university unions? Labor's current draconian stance on this issue is far from unpredictable for reasons that are blatantly obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would have this House and students across Australia believe that this legislation is to protect the human rights of students. Nothing could be further from the truth. This government claims that voluntary student unionism&mdash;this so-called heinous act which would allow students to exercise their right to freedom of association, as do all other Australians&mdash;is intended to restrict students' expressions of views on public issues by choking open debate of government policies as they affect the institution and the student body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that I speak for all fair-minded students when I say that the only side of the debate that is currently being choked in student unions and organisations around the country is that which differs from Labor. In reality, student unions, particularly the National Union of Students, are strongly Labor oriented organisations, and they do not care who knows it. Almost all student unions use part of their compulsorily acquired funds to pay for affiliate membership to the National Union of Students. The NUS is the central organisation to which about 80 per cent of Australian public university campuses are affiliated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting but not very surprising that, when we look at the fine print, we discover that, out of all the university campuses affiliated with the NUS, only a small minority of students from those universities have ever bothered to vote for that affiliation. Of those who did vote, only about nine per cent actually voted in favour of becoming affiliated with NUS. In reality, this very active political organisation which claims to represent 80 per cent, or 400,000, of the 575,000 students enrolled in Australian public universities would be lucky to represent 40,000 students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just the National Union of Students which is unrepresentative. The proportion of students who vote at student union elections around the country varies between universities. In 1993&mdash;and I take an example which is fairly representative of the usual trend from year to year&mdash;the University of Sydney recorded the country's highest voter turnout of only 16 to 17 per cent of students enrolled. Deakin University recorded the lowest voter turnout with only three per cent of the student population bothering to vote in student union elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a situation where a student organisation compels students to pay a compulsory fee, purporting to be acting in the interests of all students, whilst at best it is representative of a majority of the views of only 16 per cent of the student population. But what is more alarming is the fact that these grossly unrepresentative organisations are nothing more than Labor training grounds for Labor lackeys. These organisations cannot even claim to be representative of one-quarter of the student population, yet they are in a position to receive a significant portion of the compulsory funds levied on students and can then use those compulsorily acquired funds for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1993 federal election, NUS spent more than  $100,000 of students' compulsory fees on an anti-Liberal campaign entitled `Put the Liberals Last'. Is there any doubt then why the Labor Party places so much importance on having a strong and well funded support base in the form of the National Union of Students and student unions on university campuses? I do not think so. Is there any misconception as to why the current Labor government is so intent on ignoring the sovereignty of the states of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania by overruling those state governments' legitimate legislation in the form of this bill? I do not think so. Is there any uncertainty about whether the federal government will respect the rights of Australian students when it comes to their right to freedom of association? The answer is clearly yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government considers students as nothing more than second-class citizens when it comes to their freedom. Labor is only too happy to jump on the bandwagon of international treaty making and human rights conventions. And so it should. The right to free speech and freedom of association forms the very cornerstone of our democracy and our society. However, this government lacks the ability to stand up for its convictions almost as much as it is prepared to abandon so many other of those basic rights when it is politically expedient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this government, in the name of human and civil rights under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, that will overrule the legitimate right of the democratically elected Tasmanian government to determine and maintain its own laws and criminal code. I remind the government that article 22 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory and which Australia has ratified, also states that everyone shall have the right to freedom of association. But when the rights of students conflict with the interests of the Labor Party, human rights and civil liberties are conveniently forgotten. Clearly, these measures are in breach of article 22 of the United Nations convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sorry reflection on Labor that it selectively chooses to both abide by and ignore its own rules of fairness and justice according to its own politically expedient ends. What does the government do when the states move to legislate for voluntary student unionism? Not only does it attempt to legislate to ensure that unrepresentative and politically active student organisations receive direct funding from the federal government; it then financially penalises the state concerned by removing from state grants that amount which has been paid by the federal government to the student organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is quite prepared to give students all the freedom in the world to express their views on public issues as long as they are complementary to Labor's agenda. We should ask ourselves what this government is afraid of. What difference would it make if students were given a choice? The obvious answer is that Labor would stand to lose its unrepresentative but well-funded support bases on university campuses and student unions would become democratic and accountable organisations representative of the views of the campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To argue that student services and amenities would decline as a result of voluntary student unionism is clearly ridiculous. Individual students already get very little from student unions. In fact, most of the services and amenities that these unions provide would be better provided by university administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should ask ourselves again what this government has done for tertiary students since it came into office. Labor is denying, and has denied, students their right to freedom of association. In the 1991-92 budget, Labor increased the annual HECS contribution charge levied on all tertiary students by $144 above the normal indexation increase. In the 1993-94 budget, Labor increased the rate of repayment of the HECS debt by one per cent for each of the income threshold categories. </PARA>

It now has the audacity to make the Australian taxpayer fund student services and political activities that a clear majority of students themselves do not want to fund. It is nothing short of disgraceful that student newspapers, both internal and external political campaigns and student elections should be funded by Australian taxpayers.

Students unions, associations or guilds are a tradition developed many years ago at Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom. They are not a new phenomenon. It is also to be noted that the term `student union' is somewhat of a misnomer. Student unions are not unions in the industrial sense, especially since students are not employees in an industry. Student unions are not industrial organisations that negotiate wages and conditions on their members' behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Student unions are more in the nature of community clubs which provide a range of services to their members. Student unions do, however, engage in political campaigns and take stands on issues affecting students, such as education fees and student allowances, in a similar way to industrial trade unions and other interest groups. However, student associations are essential for countless services, such as cheap food and drink, photocopying, housing, sport, recreation, theatre, social groups, appeals, complaints, career counselling, sexual assault counselling and services for international students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that the Victorian government's legislation is aimed directly at attacking the right of student associations to actively consider and promote ideas and issues.

The questioning in which young people engage at university through student unions is an acknowledgment that they view the world differently from their parents. They are the ones who must deal with the problems of the future and the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must acknowledge that young people are left with the responsibility of dealing with the problems of tomorrow that have been created by those in authority today. That is why students question things and why they may appear to be radical to some people who do not like what they have to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such activities are an essential part of campus life. In a democratic, pluralist society, they are activities that are entitled to be supported. Historically, they have been supported by all sides of politics. It is only with the advent of the New Right within the Liberal Party post the departure of Sir Robert Menzies that we have seen the conservatives embrace this issue as a cause celebre. For most of this century, the right of students to engage in these sorts of activities was never a political question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the Kennett government on this issue are a case study on the way that government operates. The Victorian legislation was clearly politically motivated. A document sent to Victorian coalition members in February 1994 by a Liberal Party education policy committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not want compulsory student moneys flowing out to anti-Kennett and anti-coalition campaigns and other fringe activities of the hard student left.</PARA>
<PARA>Previously, it had been reported that a spokesman for the Victorian education minister, Mr Storey, had said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the legislation was not intended to affect "genuine" services, but to curtail compulsory funding for political activities.</PARA>
<PARA>In this respect, it is no different from the Kennett government's actions regarding a range of issues: on the question of restrictions to FOI legislation, as we have seen recently in relation to the Grand Prix; on the question of local government amalgamations; on the sacking of Moira Rayner, which was referred to earlier by the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland); and on the assault on the award system and restrictions to trade union activity&mdash;all actions couched in libertarian rhetoric in an inept attempt to conceal broader political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original bill proposed was even more draconian than that which was passed. The initial outrage over the proposed bill came from a range of sources, most notably from Professor David Penington, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Melbourne and not someone who could be painted as a friend of Labor. He attacked the Victorian government over the legislation, calling it intrusive, absurd and undermining university cultural life and autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the hue and cry that resulted from the draft bill, some amendments were made. Proposed section 12F included some activities that were to be banned. These were: visual arts, performing arts and audio-visual media; debating; libraries and reading rooms; academic support; accident insurance; orientation information; and support for overseas students. The amended section 12F also gave the minister the power to declare any facility, service or activity to be for the direct benefit of an institution or its students. That such activities were not included in the draft bill says a lot about what the Kennett government thinks about universities and the role that they play. It also says a lot about how paranoid the conservatives are regarding potential sources of criticism and dissent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of arguments for and against compulsory student unionism. The one which I suppose holds the most support is the question of freedom of association, which has been referred to today by a number of honourable members. The principal argument against compulsory student union membership is that it infringes upon the fundamental right to freedom of association. This is the argument used by the Western Australian government when introducing its legislation on the subject. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a signatory to three international agreements specifically outlawing the practice of compulsory association. Article 20 of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association". Australia is also a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Labour Organisation's convention concerning freedom of associations. Those conventions specifically denounce the practice of compelling individuals to become members of associations. UN General Assembly resolution 217(III) of 10 December 1948, in addressing those statements on human rights, stipulates that "every individual and every organ of society should strive to secure their universal recognition and observance". Governments have an obligation to protect the rights and liberties of their citizens. As legislators, we have an obligation to uphold and defend those rights and freedoms which have been universally recognised, including the right to freedom of association.</PARA>
<PARA>Opponents of this view argue that compulsory student union membership does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association and that this has been confirmed in the courts. In Clark v. University of Melbourne&mdash;a case which was referred to earlier by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner)&mdash;the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held that the `essence of the university's powers is that they are powers of self-government, affecting only those who choose to become members by enrolment' and that `they cannot touch anyone who does not voluntarily bring himself within their reach'. More recently, in Harradine v. University of Adelaide, the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suggestion that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at all relevant to the issue here is not sound. That Declaration is not part of the domestic law of South Australia. In any event, CL8 of Statute XXV does not deny the rights in Article 20 to anyone. The Article does not demand that there be no qualification for entry to a university as a student. Nor does it contemplate a "union" at a university. Moreover, no-one is compelled to belong to the union. Membership follows lawful entry to graduate study at the university. And, of course, membership produced by payment of a fee can be ignored, never exercised.</PARA>
<PARA>At both an international level and in local courts, it is apparent that compulsory student unionism does not constitute a breach of any legally known provision of freedom of association. Opponents of compulsory student unionism have argued that it is wrong to require a person to pay fees to a union which may in turn make financial contributions to political campaigns which run contrary to that person's beliefs. This argument, although superficially attractive, misunderstands the nature of student associations. They are elected bodies. They are representative bodies not unlike local, state or federal government, or other community based organisations that represent a constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions, I have questioned the actions of my local government, my state government and, at times, the federal government. Often, people do not agree with the actions of those who are elected to represent them. Any action, by definition, will almost certainly lack unanimity. Representative organisations act according to their charters, in what their elected representatives decide is in the best interests of their constituency. It is in the nature of democracy that there are winners and losers and that the taxes or fees of the losers will be spent on the winners' agenda. There is nothing to prevent one from becoming politically involved in order to change policies one disagrees with, and examples of this have been quoted today in this chamber by members on both sides of the House who have endeavoured to do that through the student movement. Also, there is still the right for students to choose to attend a higher education institution where one can claim conscientious objection to the payment of fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue which is often raised is the question of institutional autonomy. Administrators of higher education institutions have generally defended their right to impose compulsory student union fees on the basis of institutional autonomy. For example, in 1978, the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU asserted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The oversight of student organisations was a matter which was properly the responsibility of Council.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the university council. In 1989, the Chairman of the AVCC, Professor B.G. Wilson, said that unions were `an integral part of campus life'. The professor continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years it has been one or two actions on single issues by student political clubs and newspapers that have caused some heartburn. In the context of the larger student union picture, they are few in number and only a tiny minority in budgetary considerations.</PARA>
<PARA>He also stated that many universities already allowed or were moving towards student exemptions on the basis of conscientious objection. At the same time universities were aware that, if membership of student unionism became non-compulsory, many would simply opt out. Professor Wilson continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we should realise is that because student unions rely heavily on student participation and volunteer labour, many of the facilities they provide are at reduced costs to their student members. Many have also committed themselves to longer-term debts on permanent buildings and sporting facilities and without compulsory membership, they would be unable to repay these debts which would total many millions of dollars across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The AVCC underlined this view in its latest policy statement, noting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . government must recognise that universities are autonomous and that autonomy is necessary to protect open enquiry . . . and that autonomy and diversity should be recognised, maintained and rewarded by ensuring that universities retain control over admission of students to university . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Kennett government's actions are a direct attack on university autonomy and should therefore be opposed. The Victorian government also argues that money is being wasted and massive savings will be made by stopping political activities involving student newspapers or other areas of student union or association activity. The truth is that very little of the fees collected from student dues are used for political activity. Approximately three per cent to five per cent of the fees would be allocated to activities that could be defined as broadly political. The remainder of the money would be allocated to such things as the cafeteria, student services, sport, entertainment, theatre, and clubs and societies. That is where 95 per cent to 97 per cent of the student fees go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument being used about massive savings in student fees is deceitful. Students will not save much money as a result of this legislation. In fact, they will have less ability to have a say about what happens. For political reasons, some states wish to break down student organisations. They are not about replacing or providing the services in another way; they are about eliminating these services or operating them on an individual user-pays basis, which effectively eliminates many of the services or sees them distributed unequally along the lines of wealth. In the same way as citizens are able to engage in the political process, students are able to participate in their organisations and are able to control their organisation's policies and actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have an obligation to support the society they take part in, either through general taxation or union dues. State electors pay tax, federal electors pay tax and local electors pay rates. Student unions are democratically elected bodies representing students. The conservative state governments jump up and down about liberty whenever it means that they can put at a disadvantage some group which is able to raise a voice against anything they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the anti student union legislation is to completely disempower students. It is a fundamental right of students to be able to be critical of government, and it is of key importance that critical thinking is developed and encouraged in our universities. Those hit hardest will be the students of the smaller, less wealthy and most isolated institutions, which are already the least able to stand up for their own rights. This government has the power to act. It has a responsibility to safeguard the rights of students. The Kennett government is once again up to its old tricks, attacking its opponents with whatever means are at its disposal. There is broad support within the university sector for the actions this government is taking. The bill deserves the support of this House and of those opposite. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party is like a wily old fox. It shows cunning and stealth in many of the things it does. In Australia, the fox is considered to be vermin. The ALP plays the game of politics as if it is the creator of all things Australian, as if it provides for all Australian people. It has put its people into positions of power within most community groups in Australia to speak against any opposition. It owns the union movement. It puts its people in positions of power in the Public Service to provide ease of flow of information to it. It promotes certain journalists to push its agenda, as confirmed by Monica Attard the other day at the Walkley awards. In more recent times it has even put its own leaders in gaol. Who knows why it does this? It is probably to recruit future members. I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure Brian Burke and David Parker, both convicted criminals and former leaders of the Labor Party, are examples of the fine principles under which this party sometimes operates. We all know that the Labor Party distorts the truth, especially when it comes to keeping its word. Goebbels, that fantastic propagandist of the 1940s, did the same thing. His idea was to keep telling the same story long enough and eventually it will be accepted to be the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the current story the ALP, the Labor Party, tells in Australia. It says that there is no unemployment problem in Australia. It says that there is no overcrowding in our education system. It says that there are no problems with our health services or overcrowding in hospitals. It says that we have no problem accepting international treaties in Australia. It says that there is no problem with the social security system. This is the story that the Labor Party, the party that used to represent the interests of the Australian worker, now represents. But does it accord with the truth?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the ALP, the so-called workers party, is the party that drops people from unemployment benefits if they do not meet the standards required by the performance contracts that unemployed people are required to sign. The Labor Party also looks after the youth so well that in Australia we have fewer apprentices in training that we ever had before. This is the party that has ignored the needs of our rural community for the last four years. Its members are coming out this afternoon to talk about marvellous rural things that should have been done four years ago. This is the party that looks after our senior citizens with so much disdain that at the last election it said senior citizens would not have to pay tax any more. That lasted until 15 March, two days after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the party of high spending and high borrowing. This is the party that is creating a financial crisis for our future generations. Australians need to understand that our youth will be paying the bills that we are now creating for ourselves. This is the party that says, `Do it our way or not at all.' The romper stompers of social engineering and the thought police of the ALP are now at it again. The Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill is typical of the way the Labor Party plays politics&mdash;like the fox. Like the vermin the fox is to this country, so too is the tawdry way the Labor Party treats the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Democracy is all about choice. Many Australians who vote for the Labor Party have fought in defence of our country to make sure that Australians have freedom of choice. But, sadly, this bill perpetuates the Labor notion of no choice, and therefore no democracy. This bill takes the choice of Australian students away from them, more so in the states of Victoria, Western Australia and Tasmania. These states have applied legislation which allows students to choose whether they wish to join the formerly compulsory student unions or not to. Students&mdash;let us think about this concept&mdash;the very future of our nation, should have the basic rights of any democratic citizen; that is, the freedom to join an association or the freedom to choose not to. Yet the Labor Party, that wily and cunning old fox, wishes to perpetuate the notion that our country's youth have no responsibility and therefore demands that they join unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the right of the majority of Australians to freedom of religion. They have freedom of political choice, freedom to carry on their lives to their benefit and to this country's benefit. Yet the Labor government would have none of that. It does not give people choices. This notion is quite foreign to the members of the ALP, the romper stompers opposite. They insist that students, free thinking Australians, must join a union. The reason for demanding such is the totalitarian notion of penalising those states which have legislated for such freedom of choice. The government insists through this bill that states do not have the right to legislate their own affairs. The states do not have the right to legislate for freedom of choice. This government insists that the states cannot provide choice to their own students at university. The government is planning to withhold funds if the respective state governments do not comply with demanding that students join unions. No choice there!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by those with some knowledge of this matter that student unions provide a very definite service to students and that therefore all students should be members. I am sure that some services are provided which add to university life and help some students. I remind the House that many notable Australians have served as student representatives within certain universities, mostly Labor politicians, confirming the view that the union is financially supporting the growth of Labor Party members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most obvious to come to mind as one who has been part of this whole union movement is David Parker. The minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), would remember David Parker. He is the former Deputy Premier of Western Australia, one of the leaders of the Labor Party and now a criminal for spending funds that were donated to him. I do not know whether it is a common approach to Labor politics&mdash;we have yet to find out&mdash;this notion that if one provides one should join. The concept is that, if one serves you, you must go and join them. I cite in my own electorate the Balga and Morley Salvation Army Corps, which helps a lot of people in my electorate who are subjected to the Labor Party policies and who are really suffering in our disadvantaged society. The corps helps them but does not require them to the join the Salvation Army Corps. Yet the Labor Party thinks that students are different and requires them to join student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me draw upon a personal experience which highlights the problem associated with forcing students to join a group  which may very well be acting contrary to one's own beliefs. A constituent of Cowan, a Regina Kroczek of Marangaroo, contacted my office regarding her concerns over a publication of the April&mdash;I underline April as it is a significant month&mdash;issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harambee</EMPHASIS>, a magazine produced by the student union of Edith Cowan University. Edith Cowan, the namesake of my own electorate, was a leading campaigner for social justice back in the 1920s. She would turn in her grave if she knew what was happening at the university named after her. My constituent writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a student of Edith Cowan University I am appalled at this issue of the student guild publication, Harambee. The cover is offensive to me as a Christian. It is both blasphemous and repulsive.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, your inquiring mind is probably thinking, `What sort of thing was happening on the cover of this particular magazine?' The cover actually depicted the figure of Christ&mdash;this is in April, around Easter, which is a very important time for most Christians&mdash;at the time of crucifixion. This depiction was quite grotesque in its design. It included a huge male appendage, being the penis, in a very unflattering position. This, surely, is the lowest of bad taste student humour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the people responsible for such a design lack the fundamental maturity of knowledge, and thus wisdom, required to publish such a public document. Despite being the open-minded person that I am, I was in fact offended by the depiction. Yes, it is blasphemous and it is degrading to Christians. It is appallingly confrontationist towards any responsible and reasonable citizen. My constituent went on to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The articles inside the magazine are no more educational than the cover. The editorial itself uses the most foul language imaginable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely, in our country Australia there is still some protection of those who wish to live decent and moral lives, free from ridicule for their beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA>Not from this union, apparently. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the guild is a compulsory union for all students, including Christian students, one would expect this group to show some respect for all members who were forced to join this group. As the guild shows nothing but contempt for anyone who dares to question their standards, and they are a law unto themselves, I request your intervention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the guild was a voluntary body, they would have no choice but to give quality service to members and to treat all members with dignity and respect.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something which I think is foreign to a lot of the foxes in Australia. Here is an example of a student who may have been forced to join and risks having her funds used in a totally inappropriate way. The funds of Christian-minded students have been used to distribute Christian denigration and what could be considered threatening pornography. What are others expected to do? Under future state laws, students can be protected for they do not have to fund such activities, yet under this bill they will be forced to endure more abuse. By implication, the Labor Party stands condemned for approving this activity. This is yet another example of the Labor Party's romper stomper attitude to caring Australians: squash freedom and legislate for the enjoyment of a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attitudes of the students are shared by other community leaders within the seat of Cowan. The principal of Emmanuel Christian Community School in Girrawheen wrote to me about the very same issue. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your commitment and dedication to the community . . . I write to you to express my deepest concern about what is happening in our universities, especially in the students guild magazine. I refer to the cover of the April issue of the Harrambee produced by the Edith Cowan University student guild. I find the cover offensive, disgusting and insulting to me as a member of the community who works and cares for young people.</PARA>
<PARA>There could be a little argument that the magazine has impressed many in a very negative way but probably would not have done so if it was produced with funds from a voluntary group. The fact that compulsory funding has been used to produce a magazine which pays scant regard to the religious, political and moral attitudes of those that provide the funds is Labor totalitarianism at its finest. These funds are collected through the imposition of draconian rules that require students to join a group in which they have no say as to where those funds are being diverted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is common knowledge that student union funds were used at the last election against the Liberal Party.

It sounds remarkably familiar&mdash;the government providing funds to an organisation that in turn donates funds back to the Labor Party campaign to stay in government. I cite as an example of that particular notion the recent wharfies' pay dispute. They now do not pay tax. They do not pay Medicare. They impinge themselves on the Australian society that everyone else pays for, but the wharfies do not have to pay a thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the comments of the ACTU's Jennie George during the debate on industrial relations? She said that it was payback time.

In my home state of South Australia, the state with the most recent Liberal leadership, the Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education, Bob Such, has rightly pointed out that the term `student union' is something of a misnomer and that `student association' is a better term. Following on from this, he has made the point, `We regard university students as adults and, accordingly, the responsibility is on them to involve themselves in student association activities.'</PARA>

True, those student politicians still suffered from their own forms of undergraduate self-indulgence. Rather than reading Gramsci, they liked to quote von Hayek. But on many campuses they made a real impact. They won control of student unions. Once students were no longer funding the pet campaigns of the leftovers from the 1960s who had decided that free education meant they could spend their lives as activists, they significantly reduced union fees. When the Left howled over the introduction of a $200 government administration fee in 1987, many campuses the Left ran were forcing students to pay a higher union fee. Liberal and even moderate ALP students were able to make a real difference in student union administration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week, the opposition has been highlighting just what the government's education policies mean for students. We have been pointing out what its record has really been. The government has liked to trumpet the importance of tertiary education but, at the same time, it has failed to make sure that it is properly funded. Since 1983, the financial support provided for each full-time student has fallen by some 16 per cent. The government has liked to portray itself as the champion of accessible education, but not only has it created the means for universities to seek more funds through the charging of fees but also its own funding cuts have created a need for such fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tertiary institutions across Australia, like the ANU, are now charging fees in an increasing range of courses. They are doing it out of necessity and with the full support of the government. The student unions which hope to benefit from this legislation certainly have strange tastes in bedfellows. The government's guidelines for the 1994-96 funding triennium put the position clearly. The guidelines read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The regulation of arrangements for fee paying postgraduate courses will be considerably relaxed . . . Higher education institutions will be free to charge fees for both course work and research degrees and the level of fees charged will not be regulated. Postgraduate training that is required for registration for professional practice will not be protected.</PARA>
<PARA>With a policy like that, no wonder the government has to try to buy the silence of students. Unfortunately, it seems as if it will succeed. As I said earlier, when it comes to the crunch, the government's mates in NUS will try their hardest to cover up its record. </PARA>

But I am sure NUS will want to please the government. It will claim that life under the Liberals will be worse. Of course, under this legislation, it will be doing this with public money, since the bill allows the Commonwealth to make direct payments to student organisations for political use. </PARA>

Student unionism is scarcely a matter of national importance. Those of us who have played student politics know its significance is limited. It probably does provide some training for future political life, but virtually all of it is very petty and of interest only to the editors of student newspapers, which on so many campuses today, are like student politicians themselves&mdash;totally ignored by most students. </PARA>

At Melbourne University the student union has recently spent $20,000 attacking the policy of the democratically elected state government, but that is only the beginning of the sorts of things that these unions do. The Melbourne University student union has recently spent money&mdash;which, under the government's legislation, will be taxpayers' money soon&mdash;to defend the so-called Austudy Five, who were engaged in a violent demonstration against the policies of the federal government. The Melbourne University student union gave $500 towards the general expenses of these people and $200 towards their travel costs in going to Sydney to engage in a violent demonstration against the policies of the democratically elected government. </PARA>

So what we are going to have under this legislation of the government is WA Inc., Victoria Inc. and South Australia Inc. translated to student unions.

The National Union of Students in the last federal election campaign gave $100,000 to the federal ALP, so what we are seeing here is really a giant money laundering exercise. It is a way of taking the money of taxpayers&mdash;the money of ordinary Australians&mdash;and putting it in the coffers of the Australian Labor Party.

The Labor Party is utterly ashamed that this legislation goes directly against article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. If the ALP is going to rely on these United Nations conventions and treaties and declarations, it cannot be selective. If it believes in these rights, it believes in all of them. It cannot go around saying, `Well, yes, that's one that we will try to enforce; that's one that we won't have enforced at all.' The fact is, if you believe in these things, if you want to use these things as political manifestos in this country, either you have them all or you do not worry about them. This piece of legislation directly conflicts with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which surely should be something which members opposite hold dear. </PARA>

The fact is that when we were in student politics, when we were running these organisations, we were campaigning for this very principle, because it is a fundamental belief of people on this side of parliament that no-one should be compelled to belong to an association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, when you consider just what these student unions actually comprise, that the government should be rushing off to defend them.

In fact, the numbers of people supporting the sorts of people that this government now wants to subsidise with taxpayers' money are small.

The more people opt out of these student unions, the more taxpayers' money is going to be poured into those selfsame union coffers. In other words, this government is subsidising incompetence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore and nevertheless, the explanatory memorandum does start to draw out what this legislation is all about. For many years within our academic institutions, our tertiary institutions, where one would think that freedom of the individual was a paramount principle, there has been a compulsory levy. The levy has not been directly associated with the learning for which students attend that institution but has provided all sorts of little extras that somebody thought the students should have&mdash;not for a minute what the students themselves might have thought was necessary for them to gain an education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compulsory levy, to the best of my knowledge, was never directed to assisting the tutors, the professors and the other educationalists to better do their job; that has always been funded quite properly and separately. The sorts of services that are referred to are the availability of a cafeteria or a bar. Of course, if one were in the Temperance League one would wonder why one should be obliged to fund a bar by this most outrageous process within the academic institutions. In fact, when governments tried to persuade the chancellor and his colleagues not to make this levy compulsory, they simply said, `You can stop us but we simply will not mark the examination papers of the students who do not pay.' I just wonder how Hitler would have responded in those sorts of circumstances, but I have to say that he would have responded in a very similar way.

Do you mind if I don't remain a member this year?' That federation, being more democratic than our academic tertiary institutions, accepted that but brought it to my attention as an example of how poorly paid the lower ranks in our services are.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In finalising my response to the remarks of the member for McEwen, let me just point out this one simple fact, because he seems to have a concern that people might make improper suggestions to members of parliament from time to time. The improper suggestion I am referring to is money&mdash;money paid to members of parliament, who generally believed it was their money. It follows that that is a bribe. Of course, the donors were quick to tell the royal commission that they donated to the ALP. They saw what happened to some people in Queensland who were caught out giving money to members of parliament. I do not condone that either. I am not like you blokes. You try to say something is right because someone on the other side did it. I do not. I say it is wrong whoever did it. But what I am telling you, in the simplest of terms, is that your colleagues over there took the money and they did think they had the right to spend it.

It was no joke that he was so friendly with Holmes a Court, took his money and spent his money. It is very obvious why the SGIC, with $64 million worth of assets, was told to pay out $800 million to an entrepreneur who could not flog his assets anywhere else in Australia because the market had crashed; and you put his wife on the Reserve Bank board. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I would like to make some observations about contributions which have been made by a number of our friends from the opposition. I heard the previous speaker, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), talk about Goebbels. If ever I have heard a speech which was full of fatuous and gratuitous advice and false assertions the speech made by the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) was one. He described this piece of legislation as being about corruption and theft. You are nodding your head in affirmation. Do you accept it is about corruption and theft? His exact words were, `This bill is about corruption and theft.' He stands condemned by those words, yet the member for O'Connor stood up and, in his own gratuitous way, attacked a member on our side of the parliament for raising particular issues. I ask you: if he is fair dinkum, does he accept the proposition that the allegations made by the member for Stirling were completely out of order?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The allegations were very simple. I will repeat them: `This bill is about corruption and theft and is despicable.' They were made without substantiation. Your side is forever coming into this place and blandly making assertions about corruption with not one shred of evidence, and you expect these propositions to be copped by the Australian community. The shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), nods his head in affirmation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Hon. J.D.M. Dobie)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! The parliamentary secretary will address his remarks through the chair. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite remarkable that the shadow minister can sit here at the table and support those assertions about this piece of legislation. What is he saying? Is he saying that all student unions in Australia, or particular student guilds, or particular individuals and student guilds, or particular universities, or vice-chancellors, are corrupt? Is that what he is saying? If he wants to make those assertions, why does he not bring them into this House and table them? If he thinks there has been illegal activity, why does he not go to the police?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been no attempt by those on the other side to substantiate these allegations. They use this parliament all the time for these sorts of approaches. They are not content with addressing the issues. They come in here in a way which is completely despicable, and indeed un-Australian, and make these grandiose assertions which have absolutely no foundation. People have to ask themselves: to what depths will members of the opposition sink? This debate has epitomised the depths to which they are prepared to sink. The member for Stirling, who stands up and makes these gratuitous statements, stands condemned. I suggest to them that, if they want to make these allegations, they had better be sure of their grounds. Given the tawdry state of the opposition at present, the impression given by the opposition, including the shadow minister, is not surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding what the opposition is proposing, this bill seeks to maintain the status quo. It seeks to maintain the democratic rights and freedoms of association and freedom of speech that students currently enjoy&mdash;nothing more and nothing less. The opposition is seeking to take away these particular rights. It is the Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments who are seeking to remove these rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be clear about it. It is those state governments which are seeking to remove those rights. It is hypocritical although not surprising that the opposition is against this legislation. We have the member for Goldstein arguing that the Commonwealth interferes in the autonomy of institutions, yet here we have him supporting a piece of legislation for Victoria which is seeking to prevent an institution from receiving funds for transmission to student organisations. So what is he supporting? On the one hand, he says governments interfere too much; on the other hand, he says he wants to support a piece of legislation which validates the interference of the Victorian government in the affairs of the university and its students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to the assertion of the opposition, compulsory student unionism is not a contravention of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and legal advice supports this. The opposition claims that the legislation is forcing the costs on the taxpayers. A number of members from the opposition including the member for Stirling, the person about whom I have spoken previously, the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and the member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) argue that this legislation will take away funding for state essential services such as hospitals, schools, police and roads. They know that is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is within the province of the state governments to exercise their rights but, at the same time, they need to understand that this government believes that students should pay for their student organisations and this is what they do at the moment. That should not come as a surprise to the shadow minister if he was aware of the content of this legislation and of what happens at university campuses around Australia at this moment. The actions of the Victorian government are preventing this. It is refusing to allow universities to collect student organisation fees from the students. The opposition argues that the student organisation fees should be voluntary. It also knows, or it should know, that there have always been avenues for conscientious objections from students so that they can choose not to join. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not, as the opposition pretends, about guaranteeing income for students so that the government does not have to worry about them. It is not about buying the silence of students, as the member for Sturt claims. I can recall my days at university. They are in the long distant past, but I vividly remember my involvement with student unions and student politics. I cannot think of one occasion on which we went out to support the government of the day. Whilst it is understandable that the opposition should be concerned about its support amongst the student community for its policies, or lack of, what it should not be concerned about is the fact that students should actually have political views and involve themselves in political activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition were aware and fully cognisant and supported the rights of full participation in a democracy, it would be saying, `Go right ahead; let us encourage it.' Because it believes that, somehow or other, there is a connection between student unions and the Australian Labor Party or other nefarious political organisations, what it is saying is that we should not allow these unions or these guilds to operate. That is the logic of its position and it is completely unsustainable. It is a fundamental right for students to be critical of the government and the opposition and it is of key importance that critical thinking should be developed and encouraged in our universities and other educational institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand who opposes this proposal. The people who are opposing the government's legislation are the conservative state governments around Australia and the opposition&mdash;not the universities, not the student guilds, not the unions relevant to the higher education institutions but the opposition. Why is the opposition opposed to it? Its mate, Jeff Kennett, the Premier of Victoria, has decided he wants to take a stick to students. The people of Victoria are fed up to the back teeth with the way in which they have been treated by the Kennett government over education matters. Students have the temerity to demonstrate their opposition to the Victorian government and perhaps to use their own organisational skills and their own resources, which they properly have as a result of their association with these universities, to organise against the Victorian government so the way to stop them is to silence them. The opposition will not allow them to operate. It will just turn them off. That is the approach which is being advanced by the opposition and it is the sort of approach which is not acceptable to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out that in a policy paper released by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee on 26 April student organisations are described as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not only providing essential services and facilities but also are an important element in the social and cultural aspects of universities and are part of the education process. They encourage a broad range of activities by funding diverse groups, ranging from religious societies to faculty associations to debating clubs. Participation in these activities is educational in the broadest sense, encouraging students to develop their social skills.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps important, you would think, even for the opposition. The paper continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Student organisations also promote a wide range of sporting activities and provide recreational facilities for the student community.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the student organisations also lobby for the rights and welfare of students more generally, and they should be supported for doing that. The NUS, the National Union of Students, acts as a national voice for students and should be acknowledged for doing so. But, of course, we cannot have the NUS, as it might at various times, choosing to oppose the opposition; if they are seen to oppose the opposition, we should silence them! That is the answer: shut them up; do not allow them to operate! We had the member for O'Connor talking about Goebbels. If we are talking about fascist activity, this about takes the cake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to members opposite that they continue to claim that somehow or other the NUS is stacked by Labor stooges. I do not know how we are supposed to operate this organisation. Most members opposite themselves at some stage or another were university students. Are they suggesting that there is some fifth column of the Labor Party in universities? What are they saying about the rights of people to have opinions of their own? What are they saying about the rights of individuals to organise? What I read into this opposition and the will of the Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments is that they oppose those rights. They do not like people to be different; they want people to think the same as them. If people do not think the same as them, do not let them operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to honourable members opposite, in case they had not realised it&mdash;and I suspect that the shadow minister has not realised it&mdash;that the NUS has been demonstrating against the Labor government even as late as last week. It lobbied hard in the lead-up to the budget and we expect it to lobby hard in the lead-up to the next budget. It is lobbying now against possible introduction of increased costs for students, against up-front fees and possible changes to HECS. Indeed, in my own electorate there was a demonstration outside my office late last week. I did not get the police and say, `Listen, shoo these people away, lock them up, close them down.' They had a legitimate right to demonstrate for their views; they had a legitimate right to be heard. In fact, my response on radio was to encourage them in that activity, because that is what they should be doing, expressing views, having opinions and making sure that they are heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are also currently demonstrating against the university administration and the government of the ANU. In the course of my consideration of this demonstration last week in Darwin, I actually recalled quite vividly a similar occupation of the chancellery building here at ANU when I was a student. That was 1973. Perhaps I am divulging something which I should not divulge. I can recall the occupation of the chancellery and I participated in that activity. It was not some wicked act, we were not anarchists, we were not bomb-throwers or terrorists. The seats were marginally more comfortable than the ones we were sitting on in the lecture theatres. What we were doing was demonstrating, as we thought was our right and was seen to be our right by the university, and as is being accepted by this university, the ANU, as the right of the students here in Australia today. We were demonstrating because we wanted to make a point about a range of important educational issues, exactly as students were doing last week, however misguided they might have been in their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess this is really at the heart of it: members of the opposition do not want students to understand, have a view or express a view about opposition policy. I do not blame the opposition, because it would be exposed as not having a policy. If it has one, it has not articulated it, and the only response that students can make to the opposition is, `We recall your policies prior to the last election. We recall the proposals for vouchers and for full fees.' There is no indication if there is another policy, if there is a new policy or if the opposition has resiled from this policy. What is the opposition's policy? Does it have a policy? It has an opposition leader who certainly does not know where he is, so I suspect he does not know what his policies are. But I imagine that, at the appropriate time, he will pull one out of his back pocket and demonstrate it, perhaps to people in business. He will then go around, be confronted by a group of students who oppose him&mdash;and he will pull out a different policy, because that has been his form to date. I do not expect it will change in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) likened the government to a sly fox. I have already remonstrated with the member for Stirling. The government has stood by its commitments to students, has been up-front about its policies and is consulting with students. But what can the opposition tell students around Australia? Really, I do not need to talk in depth about a document that has sunk without trace but, in launching The Things That Matter at the National Press Club, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) indicated that the opposition will be encouraging education institutions to look to `new and creative ways of attracting funds from the private sector'. That is what we know about the opposition's higher education policy. According to Senator Hill, on 2CN on 15 September, we will have to wait until the next election before the details of these innovative ways of raising money are obtained. Is it any wonder that people in the community, including students at universities and other institutions, might query what the opposition's policies really are?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Warringah made an outrageous claim that this bill is a way of redirecting funds from students into the Labor Party coffers. This is untrue, and the honourable member and other members of the opposition would be well advised to check the facts. The National Union of Students did not make a financial contribution to the ALP during the last election, very contrary to the article published by Padraic McGuiness in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 30 June. These assertions are incorrect; they are without foundation. For the information of the members opposite, the National Union of Students has instructed its solicitors to issue a defamation suit against Nationwide News Pty Ltd, the publishers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and Mr McGuiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I suggest to the member for Warringah that, when talking about this issue, people should think very carefully about what they say outside of this parliament. We can expect that they will repeat those sorts of allegations in this place because they use it as a cowards' castle, as I said earlier in my speech. They are prepared to make outrageous claims, assertions and defame individuals or organisations without any substantiation and use this parliament as a protection&mdash;the protection of privilege. Yet they will not walk out of the shelter of this parliament to make those allegations in public because they know that when they do&mdash;if they were able to, if they were game to, if they had the guts to&mdash;inevitably they would be in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a pity that the members of the opposition similarly have not taken the time to check the facts in this case instead of building their case on lies and scaremongering. This government stands on its record. It is strongly opposed to the introduction of up-front fees for undergraduate courses, and it has made a strong commitment to the HECS scheme. Total Commonwealth funding on higher education will have increased from $3 billion in 1983 to $4.8 billion in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is strong on criticism but not on policy. It has not given us any reasons why this bill should not progress through this House and through this parliament. The opposition has relied on false accusations and defamation, essentially, of groups and individuals who are outside of this place. The opposition has no substance to its allegations. Those opposite know that they cannot prove those false allegations and they should be condemned for them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill was introduced on 30 May 1994 after passing through the Senate with minor amendments. It was then referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee reported on 30 June 1994 and recommended that the bills be passed by the House after the incorporation of some amendments. A government response to the committee's report has been tabled and government amendments will be moved later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations which were imposed by the United Nations Security Council on 25 May 1993, when it adopted resolution 827. That resolution established the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Since 1991, and adopted the statute of the international tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to establish the tribunal as an enforcement measure under chapter VII of the United Nations Charter created, from 25 May 1993, an immediately binding obligation on UN member states, including Australia, to take whatever action necessary to implement the Security Council's decision and to meet the obligations imposed under the statute of the international tribunal. It is obviously desirable that Australia should be in a position to comply with requests for cooperation with the tribunal as soon as they are received, and it is therefore important to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statute imposes obligations on member states `to cooperate with the international tribunal in the investigation and prosecution' of accused persons and to comply `with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber'. Such requests may involve, among other things, the identification and location of persons, the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, the arrest and detention of persons, and the surrender of accused persons to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill contains provisions enabling Australia to comply with these international obligations. It specifically provides for the handing over of accused persons to the tribunal for trial; other forms of assistance to enable cooperation with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders; the recovery and return of property and proceeds of crime located within Australia; and the tribunal to sit in Australia if it so desires. The aim was to keep the legislation as simple as possible, while still enabling us to meet our international obligations. The bill adopts a minimalist approach, providing only for the mandatory obligations imposed by the statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was originally intended that the bill would also provide for imprisonment in Australia of persons convicted by the tribunal. We have been consulting with the states and territories on this issue, as any persons will need to be imprisoned in state and territory prisons. The matter has not been included in the bill because not all states and territories have responded on this issue, and imprisonment within Australia is not a mandatory obligation under the statute. However, I recognise that it may be desirable to amend the legislation at an appropriate time, for example, when all the states and territories have responded, and if the tribunal commences proceedings against Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now mention some important features of the bill. Part 3 of the bill covers the surrender aspect of our obligations. The statute requires countries to `comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber, including . . . the surrender or the transfer of the accused to the International Tribunal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Extradition Act 1988 was used as a general model for Part 3 of the bill, the bill departs from that act in a number of ways because of the different circumstances and purposes of the legislation. In this case, Australia has binding international obligations to comply with requests for assistance by the tribunal, and as a result the mechanism for handing over of persons to the tribunal is more streamlined and has less grounds of refusal than under the Extradition Act. The reason for this different approach stems from the unique nature of our international obligations. One way in which this case differs from usual extradition situations is that the obligation to transfer accused persons to the tribunal is derived not from a treaty based obligation but from the duty of UN member states to implement the decisions of the Security Council. In addition, persons would be surrendered to an international body rather than to another country. In any event, persons surrendered to the tribunal will have the benefit of internationally recognised procedural and legal safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the bill provides for the Attorney-General to have a residual discretion to refuse the surrender of a person in exceptional circumstances. I note that a government amendment to be moved later proposes that the word `exceptional' be replaced with `special'. Although exercise of this discretion may cause some embarrassment internationally, it does provide discretionary protection for Australian residents that may not be available under the tribunal's safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parts 4 and 6 of the bill provide for other types of assistance to enable Australia to cooperate with the tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of alleged offenders, as required by the statute.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 covers the taking of testimony and the production of evidence, the service of documents, search and seizure assistance, and assistance in relation to the giving of evidence at hearings, and assisting in investigations in foreign countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears that the tribunal may make forfeiture or confiscation orders under the statute and then seek to have those orders enforced in Australia. It is not totally clear exactly what kinds of orders, if any, the tribunal may make in relation to the proceeds of crime. It is envisaged at this stage that the tribunal is only likely to make forfeiture orders and therefore the bill in part 6 includes provisions whereby forfeiture orders may be enforced in Australia. If the tribunal determines at a later date that it will make restraining orders or pecuniary penalty orders, which it might seek to have enforced in a particular country, or that it will issue information gathering orders, then it will be necessary at that time to amend the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parts 4 and 6 are based upon corresponding provisions in the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. However, one major difference is the grounds on which a request may be refused. While the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act contains a number of such grounds, the bill has only very limited grounds, namely, that complying with the request would prejudice Australia's sovereignty, security or national interest or that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the non-compliance. This is a direct result of the binding international obligations in this situation. Apart from this matter, the procedures in parts 4 and 6 of the bill are almost identical to those employed in similar situations under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill covers the possibility of the tribunal sitting in Australia. Although this is considered to be a remote possibility, the provisions are necessary because the Security Council resolution provides that, while the tribunal is to have its seat at The Hague, it may sit elsewhere when it considers it necessary for the efficient exercise of its functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While sitting in Australia, the tribunal would be exercising the judicial power of the international community, not the judicial power of the Commonwealth. However, Commonwealth legislation is required to authorise the tribunal to exercise coercive powers within Australia, such as to compel attendance, and to require production of evidence. The Security Council resolution does not compel Australia to automatically authorise the exercise of such powers. As  matters of comity, countries would expect agreements to be reached about the exercise of power in their territory by a foreign tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 of the bill therefore enables the tribunal to sit in Australia for the purpose of performing its functions, and provides that the tribunal's powers while sitting in Australia will be such powers as are prescribed by regulations. Those regulations will implement agreements between the Commonwealth and the tribunal about the powers that the tribunal may exercise while sitting in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue in the short term. However, there are possible implications for Commonwealth agencies which may be affected by the legislation. For example, there may be resource implications for the Australian Federal Police, and cost and resource implications might arise if the tribunal decides to sit in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These costs cannot be quantified at all at this stage as they will depend upon the extent to which the legislation is used in Australia. However, the legislation will be reviewed after it has been in place for a period of 12 months to determine the extent to which it has been utilised and to assess the resource implications. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA>The International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill is consequential upon the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994. It was introduced on 30 May 1994 and has been considered by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. An amendment to the bill arising from the committee's recommendations will be moved later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes consequential amendments to certain Commonwealth acts. The amendment of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act is to the effect that decisions under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1994 will not be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. A government amendment will shortly be moved to delete this amendment. This will give effect to the committee's recommendation that decisions under the proposed act be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendments to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act is to enable the Director of Public Prosecutions to appear in proceedings, and to grant indemnities to persons who are to give evidence for the purpose of proceedings, under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Migration Act simply facilitate the entry into Australia and subsequent departure of persons who are required in Australia for purposes connected with the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act enable forfeiture orders made by the international tribunal and registered under the International War Crimes Tribunal Act to be enforced as if they were forfeiture orders made under the Proceeds of Crime Act at the time of registration. This is consistent with the approach by which foreign forfeiture orders registered in a court in Australia under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the amendment to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is to ensure that lawfully intercepted information can be used in proceedings under division 1 of part 4 of the International War Crimes Tribunal Act. Those proceedings cover the taking of evidence, or production of documents or other articles in Australia for the purposes of, and at the request of, the tribunal. The bill is expected to have little impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do so today in the permanent absence of the former member for Kooyong, and I might just very briefly, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, add my comments to those already expressed on the recent resignation of the member. I suppose Mr Peacock has been a member and part of my political understanding and circles for a very long time. In fact, my late mother was a great admirer of Andrew Peacock, and I can remember how it was that, when the Sandringham branch of the Liberal Party was reformed in the late 1950s, the rising star of the Liberal Party, then Mr Andrew Peacock, was invited to chair the re-formation meeting. My mother was a person of some political acumen, and when my mother said that Andrew Peacock was a person of stature and ability it was an impression and a remark that has remained with me for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, I suppose your appreciation of a person's quality varies a bit with your experience, but my experience with Andrew, and it has been solidified over time, is that Andrew is a person of very great character, and I know his departure from the House will be greatly missed. One of my colleagues in the media was remarking on his superlative performances in the last week in dealing with the media. It shows you that experience is a very valuable thing in politics. Of course, in the foreign affairs area he brought tremendous experience and great credit to his country in the way in which he acted, not just as the minister but as the shadow minister for foreign affairs. So it is that I find myself today warehousing the shadow ministry for foreign affairs and speaking on this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills before the House will establish a legislative framework enabling Australia to comply with a resolution of the United Nations Security Council establishing an International War Crimes Tribunal. This tribunal will prosecute crime arising from the ongoing conflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. In May 1993, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution establishing an international tribunal for the sole purpose of prosecuting persons responsible for serious violations of international law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This resolution adopted the statute of the international tribunal which details the competence, jurisdiction, powers, composition and procedure of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution was taken under chapter VII of the charter of the UN, which concerns actions with respect to threats to peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression. Resolutions taken by the Security Council pursuant to this chapter are mandatory and binding on members of the United Nations. In particular, article 29 of the statute provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. States shall cooperate with the International Tribunal in the investigation and prosecution of persons accused of committing serious violations of international humanitarian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. States shall comply without undue delay with any request for assistance or an order issued by a Trial Chamber, including, but not limited to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the identification and location of persons;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e)the surrender or the transfer of the accused to the International Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Pursuant to the terms of the resolution, Australia, along with other member countries, has an obligation, as is clear from the words I have just read, at international law to cooperate with the tribunal and to take measures under domestic law to implement the provisions of the resolution and the statute. This bill seeks to fulfil these international obligations by making provision for these matters in Australia's domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has made a significant contribution to the international tribunal. Sir Ninian Stephen, a former Governor-General and High Court judge, has been appointed as one of the 11 judges of the tribunal by the General Assembly of the UN. The previous director of the Australian War Crimes Special Investigations Unit and the War Crimes Prosecutions Support Unit has been appointed a deputy prosecutor to the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill have been outlined today by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). Therefore, it is unnecessary for me to go to the provisions in any detail. But I will just say that part 1 of the bill is preliminary. Part 2 allows the tribunal to make a request for assistance to the Attorney-General. Part 3 establishes a mechanism that allows for the surrender of persons to the tribunal. There is a discretion in the executive, or government, to refuse a request by the tribunal. However, this discretion is much tighter than the Extradition Act 1988 on which the bill is modelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 deals with other forms of assistance to the tribunal, including the taking of evidence and production of documents in Australia, search and seizure in Australia of evidentiary material, giving evidence at hearings or assisting in investigations in foreign countries. Part 5 covers the possibility, which is acknowledged by the government to be remote, of the tribunal sitting in Australia. Part 6 deals with the possibility of the tribunal making forfeiture orders and allows for their enforcement in Australia. Again, this part is modelled on provisions in other legislation; namely, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Part 7 elaborates the powers of search, seizure and arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A brief history of the bill is that it was passed by the Senate with amendments, and there was a lot of debate in the Senate about aspects of the bill. The Australian Democrats introduced amendments which were not agreed to by the coalition. The shadow minister for justice, Senator Vanstone, who has had carriage of the bill in the Senate, believed that the amendments moved by the government and the Democrats required further examination and should be examined by a legal and constitutional affairs committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the first reading of the bill in the House of Representatives, the bill was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. From my reading of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, there was a discussion in parliament when the committee handed down its recommendations. There are a number of members on the committee from the coalition side: the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). It is generally recognised that the committee has done a very thorough job. This confirms once again the usefulness to the parliament of a committee structure that can examine legislation of this sort in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition had a number of concerns with the legislation. We were keen for the bill to be referred to a committee. Our concerns covered such matters as the potential embarrassment that could be caused by there being an opportunity for the Attorney-General to not pass over the subject of a warrant to the International War Crimes Tribunal. In other words, there was some discretion in the hands of the Attorney-General which may have created difficulties given the fact that Australia's participation in the UN places upon us a mandatory requirement to comply with such a request. We were also concerned that complications could arise in an emergency situation under the proposed legislation. There was also concern about the seriousness of agreeing to hand over citizens into someone else's jurisdiction especially when we could not rule out the prospect that it may be our citizens that could come within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those matters were referred to the committee and the committee did a very thorough job investigating them. The committee has basically answered the concerns that we had. I was very pleased to see in the committee report dated 30 June 1994 that the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . before surrendering an accused person the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either in the manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a most important point that the chairman made. I am pleased to see him in the chamber today presumably to speak on the bill. The government has now responded to the very extensive report of the parliamentary committee and the bulk of the recommendations have been picked up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Tangney will speak on some of the recommendations contained in the report and the response from the government. He is one of the best qualified lawyers in the parliament. He is a Queen's Counsel. We are very pleased to have the benefit of his advice on this and many other matters. He has been concerned to encourage the government to take up a recommendation for the introduction of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) procedures into this legislative framework. This was a matter requiring a delicate balancing of factors by the government. After its reconsideration of the issue, it took up the recommendations of the committee. Having previously considered the matter and taken the decision the other way, this was quite a good win for the committee, and it reflects well on all concerned that the government has now erred on the side of providing an additional avenue of appeal for Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two recommendations which the government did not entirely adopt in its otherwise supportive response to the committee's recommendations. The government did not accept recommendation No. 12 which was aimed at ensuring the right of Australians to return to Australia without falling foul of the current migration law. The government's response basically is that people have this right of return and it would not in any way be affected or reduced by the operations of our international obligations pursuant to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation that the government did not adopt was recommendation No. 20, in relation to a sunset clause. The committee recommended that the idea of a sunset clause be further considered. After further consideration, the government rejected the idea of a sunset clause but came back with a commitment to review the operation of this legislation. I think the minister said that it would be reviewed after 12 months, whereas the government's response mentioned a longer period. Be that as it may, it is important that this new procedure be the subject of close monitoring to ensure that it operates in the way intended by the parliament. That is all I wish to contribute on behalf of the coalition parties in respect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a general comment on Australia's action in complying with the obligations we have as a participant in the United Nations. From these bills, our message should be very clear&mdash;and I believe it is very clear: war crimes will not be tolerated. We stand ready with other participants in the United Nations, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Sweden and Italy, to act against war criminals. The message to those responsible for heinous crimes against humanity is that the civilised world will give them no safe haven. Their conduct cannot be allowed to go unpunished. As a responsible member of the world community, we will undertake our obligations in concert with others to ensure that we do all we can to bring to justice those who commit heinous criminal offences. This is an important principle for all Australians per se, not just for the way in which we stand as a member of the international community. If we are not prepared to stand against injustice elsewhere, we taint our own notions and standards of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about international obligations, and there will be a lot more debate about them in this parliament. In this matter, we voluntarily enter into the United Nations and thereby voluntarily accept our obligations to the world community to participate in actions such as this. It may be mandatory for Australia to introduce, at domestic law, a legal framework so that we can meet our obligations at the UN, but we meet those obligations willingly because that is part and parcel of our participation in the work of the United Nations. It must always be the case for a country such as Australia to give very high priority to bringing to justice those who commit serious war crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence which may provide the basis for some prosecutions. For example, one suspect is apparently in custody in Germany, and I understand that others may fall within the jurisdiction of this tribunal. Many Australians would feel that this is not a matter with which they are directly associated, and that may well be true, but I conclude by saying that we have obligations as a member of the international community and this legislation ensures that we meet those obligations. It thereby has the support of the coalition parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise in support of the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill which are before the House today. I understand that a number of amendments will be moved by the government later arising out of an advisory report that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs placed before the parliament on 30 June 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the benefit of being provided with the government's response to that advisory report. Basically the advisory report by the committee made 21 recommendations that the committee thought would, in effect, be constructive suggestions that would strengthen the legislation and would not detract from our international obligations. It is pleasing to note that the government has accepted, in effect, 18 of the 21 amendments and has partially accepted a 19th amendment, which is not a bad strike rate&mdash;18 1/2 out of 21 will do me any day of the week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That strike rate is indicative, frankly, of a number of things. We are fortunate on that committee to have a number of committed members from both sides of the parliament with a level of expertise that shows that exercises like these can be beneficial. We are also fortunate, in my opinion, to have a very professional secretariat, a secretariat that this parliament can be proud of. Too often we as members of parliament do not acknowledge enough the professional support structure we receive in this place. I would also like to commend the secondee from the Attorney-General's Department, Ms Annette Willing, who was seconded to assist the committee in the preparation of the advisory report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only the second advisory report that has been placed before the parliament, but it is the second one where substantially the recommendations of the committee have been taken up by the government. That is no mean feat and stands testament to the professionalism, as I say, of the support structure that we have on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point needs to be made and reiterated that it is a partnership. In this report, and the previous one also, we were about making constructive suggestions. We had bipartisan support basically for the purposes of the legislation and for the principles behind the legislation. Frankly, I am a great believer that we are not here just as rubber stamps and that the repository of wisdom does not just lie in the executive or the bureaucracy. We are here as representatives of the people and we should be prepared through procedures like this, in terms of advisory reports or public hearings, to subject our legislation to scrutiny because I believe it can be enhanced and enriched. That is what has happened here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, when the legislation was placed before the Senate, the government formed a particular view. I think the reason it formed a particular view was&mdash;and this should be noted&mdash;that we were one of the first countries to respond to United Nations resolution 827 that was passed on 25 May 1993 by the Security Council. As a committee, we had the benefit of looking at some draft legislation from other countries. As I said in my foreword to the committee report of 30 June, in making recommendations to the parliament it became important for us to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, before surrendering an accused person the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either in the manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender.</PARA>
<PARA>Basically, a lot of our recommendations were finetuning. The government did change its original approach to a couple of the substantial ones, which I will come to. Initially, it was a situation where the Australian Democrats had moved amendments in the Senate because the government's position was that it was not going to allow some judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 because it felt that that might constitute undue delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became obvious during the hearings, and indeed from what had happened in other countries overseas, that it was too strict a definition to say that the fact you were allowing people to exercise their legal obligations within your jurisdiction could itself constitute undue delay. It is good that the government has accepted the committee's recommendation in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation the committee made that the government has accepted, and which I think will assist, is that `exceptional circumstances' be replaced by `special circumstances' in subclause 12(3) of the legislation. It is pleasing that the government has accepted that. Whilst we as a committee understand the use of the words `exceptional' and `special', we were attempting to ensure that there was some consistency in the terminology. It is worth reading the government's response, which states why it accepted this recommendation, because it summarises basically what the committee's concerns were. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>namely, that `exceptional' be replaced by `special' in subclause 12(3). It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that, in light of the objectives of the Bill, the seriousness of the alleged crimes and the mandatory nature of Australia's international obligations, the circumstances <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">should</EMPHASIS> be exceptional for bail to be granted to a person arrested pursuant to the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee appears to have accepted this concept.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed we did. The committee considered that the advantage of using `special' instead of `exceptional' would be that `special circumstances' is a recognised term in the extradition field and there is a body of case law on its meaning. I think basically the government accepted that, which is pleasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my foreword to the advisory report I did give a narrative on these bills. I think it is worth restating. The purpose of the bills is to allow Australia to fulfil its obligations to the United Nations, to support the tribunal now being established in The Hague. The tribunal will try war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia since 1991. The tribunal was established by resolution 827 of 25 May 1993 of the Security Council. This resolution expressed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . grave alarm at continuing reports of widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law occurring within the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and especially in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including reports of mass killings, massive, organised and systematic detention and rape of women, and the continuance of the practice of "ethnic cleansing", including for the acquisition and the holding of territory.</PARA>
<PARA>As a member of the United Nations, Australia is bound to give effect to resolution 827 and to its annexure, the Statute of the International Tribunal. The resolution urges all states to take any measures necessary under their domestic law to implement the provisions of the present resolution and the statute. The resolution, the Statute of the International Tribunal and comments by the president of the tribunal, Mr Antonio Cassese, combine to urge member states to surrender persons who are named in warrants issued by the tribunal without undue delay and to adopt a strict interpretation of this requirement. The tribunal has been established as the court with the responsibility to ensure internationally acceptable standards of justice are upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has studied the comparable legislation of other countries and finds that in most cases wider safeguards than those encompassed by the Australian legislation are available before citizens are surrendered to the tribunal. Recognising the binding obligation to support the tribunal need not be interpreted as agreeing to the automatic surrender of accused persons to an international tribunal. It appears not to have been so interpreted by Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada or the UK. The upholding of legal rights should not be construed as undue delay in complying with resolution 827. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters substantive to the charges laid against an accused person are the proper subject of trial before a trial chamber of the tribunal and should not be addressed before surrender. However, before surrendering the accused person, the Australian legal system should ensure that surrender does not result in injustice, either in the manner in which the person is treated before surrender or in the fact of surrender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon releasing the report the committee urged the parliament to pass both bills as soon as possible, allowing sufficient time to consider the amendments contained in the advisory report. Bringing war criminals to account, albeit in only one theatre of war, will act as a deterrent to the commission of further outrages, which is one of the main objectives of the tribunal. Enacting the legislation as soon as possible will allow Australia to comply with requests for assistance from the tribunal as soon as they are received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incorporation of the amendments that have been accepted by the government as a result of our advisory report will produce legislation that Australia can be proud of in terms of complying with our international obligations. It will also mean&mdash;I reiterate this&mdash;that Australian citizens will still be able to exercise their rights under Australian law. They will not be able to go into a delaying process. All round, what we have managed to achieve is something substantial. I see I am getting the wind-up. </PARA>

They have been able to withstand scrutiny and they have resulted in better legislation. I would urge the government and, indeed, the opposition to continue to use this practice, not necessarily just in the case of the legal committee but also in the case of other committees of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for Finance aware that a farmer in drought affected Queensland has recently had his loan interest rates increased by 2.38 per cent? This rate increase means a massive jump in his costs of $6,000 per annum, or $115 per week, during this appalling drought. This farmer cannot currently afford to continue to pay for feeding stock and, according to the Treasurer, further interest rate increases are on the cards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The federal government warmly welcomes today's decision by the Industrial Relations Commission which provides for three $8 safety net adjustments to workers unable to gain pay rises through enterprise bargaining. We also welcome the commission's decision to conduct a series of pilot reviews in the lead-up to the overall review of awards which is required in accordance with the government's Industrial Relations Reform Act. We fully support the commission's stated intention to make awards easier to understand, more adaptable to the needs of the enterprise, non-discriminatory and consistent. Today's decision represents a further step in the important transition from a centralised wages system to one of enterprise bargaining which is underpinned by a strong and relevant award safety net of wages and entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the accord partners have welcomed it, I note that today the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has branded this decision as the worst for years. Its response would do Scrooge proud. Australia currently has strong economic growth. We have company profits at record levels and the salaries of senior managers are on the way up. Yet the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry would seek to deny workers increases of $8 per week&mdash;hardly what any fair-minded Australian would call excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ACCI and those who hold its view should realise that, as a result of this decision, they are going to have to work cooperatively with the union movement, other employers, the government and the commission to ensure the success of the award review process that lies ahead. Today's decision completes the changes introduced by the government with our new industrial relations laws in March this year. It strengthens the award safety net and provides incentives for enterprise bargaining. Many workers will gain access to an immediate safety net adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that this is a decision of which we should all be proud.

Does the minister realise that the recent government induced rise of 0.75 per cent is lifting their interest repayments by $3,375 per year to $52,875? Does the minister also realise that if another one per cent rise flows through, as is likely in the next few months, their interest commitments will rise a further $4,500 per year to $57,375? Will these interest rate increases far outweigh any possible assistance to Martyn and Penny Buckland from the government's announced drought package?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not in a position to know the individual financial arrangements of any particular farmer. To assume that I do in the answer to a question is very silly. The position that people find themselves in in relation to interest rates is determined by the nature of the loan that they took out with their particular bank and whether the bank has chosen to pass on, in business rates or in rates to farmers, the full extent of the increase. There will be a variety of experiences in the rural community as there will be elsewhere in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only add to and re-emphasise what was said by the Treasurer when he answered these questions yesterday. Interest rate policy is fundamentally directed towards keeping in place our very favourable inflation record. Interest rates supporting that are at historically low levels in this country. The fact of the matter is that the interests of your friends on the farm very much lie in sustaining that low inflation rate regime. As monetary policy enhances that, they ought to be pleased with it.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2V5">Mr SWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of a document which claims, among other things, that Australia has experienced declining international competitiveness and that Australia has one of the highest personal tax burdens in the OECD, well above the average of seven major industrial countries? Can the minister inform the House what the official figures are? Is it the intention of the government to review its budget figures in light of the data?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1252" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I do recognise the particular document that the honourable gentleman refers to. It is among that farrago of nonsense which appeared in The Things That Matter. One of the claims in The Things That Matter is that we have declining international competitiveness. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publishes data on our international competitiveness each month in its publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian economic indicators</EMPHASIS>. What that data gathered by the ABS shows is that between 1982-83 and 1992-93, all three indexes by which competitiveness is measured showed improvements to the tune of 27.3 per cent, 29.6 per cent and 31.5 per cent respectively. We do not have full year figures for this year but the indication from the first three quarters is that, again, on all three versions, this year we will improve our competitiveness over last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, far from a decline in our international competitiveness, as claimed by that extraordinarily inaccurate document, there has been an absolutely massive improvement in Australia's international competitiveness. The Things That Matter then goes on to say that Australia has:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . one of the highest personal tax burdens in the OECD well above the average of the seven major industrial countries . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The statistics that the secretariat of the OECD compiled present a totally different picture. Each year, the OECD publishes a volume titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Revenue statistics of OECD member countries</EMPHASIS>. The latest complete set of figures is for 1992, and it measures the personal income tax to GDP ratio. For Australia, total income tax collected&mdash;and that includes the Medicare levy, as these figures are taken out on equivalents so where there is an equivalent sort of charge to a levy associated with income in any of the countries measured it is incorporated within the statistics&mdash;was 11.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average rate of personal taxation for OECD countries was 15.7 per cent. Out of the 24 OECD countries covered, Australia had the fifth lowest personal tax to GDP ratio. The document leaves all that aside and talks about the big seven. That is what the document refers to, not necessarily the OECD average. Of the so-called big seven, not one of the seven countries mentioned in the document presented a better picture than did Australia. The nearest to us was Japan, at 12.1 per cent compared with our 11.7 per cent. There was then the United Kingdom, 12.6 per cent; the United States, 14 per cent; France, 13.5 per cent; Italy, 15.6 per cent; Canada, 16.5 per cent; and Germany, 18.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In most of those countries, the indirect tax that people are obliged to ante up is also in excess of Australia's. So it is not as though there is somehow or other a weighting inside Australia, perhaps in the indirect taxation area, because many of them have the sort of value added tax that the opposition wanted to put in place. If that is the level of statistical comprehension that underpins The Things That Matter, it is small wonder that opposition members do not wish to reveal the rest of the statistics associated with the costing of their program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Does he agree with the recent study by the National Farmers Federation that reducing the budget deficit this year by $2 billion could reduce long-term interest rates by one full percentage point? Has Treasury done any modelling on this proposal and is there a connection between lower budget deficits and lower interest rates, which would mean lower mortgage payments for Australian home owners?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, that particular proposition was answered by the Treasurer yesterday in a different form.

As far as the Opposition Leader's answer is concerned, it was pointed out to you very effectively by the Treasurer yesterday that there is not necessarily at any point of time a direct connection between the level of deficit and the level of interest rates. A multiplicity of factors impact upon interest rates. So you can have the situation in New Zealand, which has a budget actually moving into surplus but at the same time its official interest rates are above ours. How, on your criteria, would you explain that set of circumstances? While you may well like your economics simple, they are not and there is not necessarily a direct connection between any particular level of deficit at any point of time and short-term interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Attorney-General to recent suggestions that section 1316 of the Corporations Law may impede the proper pursuit of corporate crime. The Attorney would of course be aware that section 1316 imposes a five-year limitation period on the commencement of prosecutions for  offences under the Corporations Law unless the Attorney consents to an extension of that period of time. Can the Attorney-General advise the House what action he intends to take in respect of that section?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1253" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly am aware of criticisms of that provision in the Corporations Law. Indeed, the honourable member in his capacity as chair of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities in its report a bit earlier this year also referred to this section and to views expressed by the head of the Australian Securities Commission, Mr Allan Cameron, that that provision is an impediment to the proper pursuit of wrongdoing under the Corporations Law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular provision has its genesis in similar provisions in the old companies code and was incorporated into the new Corporations Law during that process of effectively adopting the status quo of the law. The provision is, in my view, odd inasmuch as it remains the only provision which requires the consent of the Attorney-General in terms of whether a prosecution should proceed. With the establishment of the Director of Public Prosecutions there has been a clear division of responsibility in terms of whether prosecutions should proceed or not, that being vested in independent bodies clearly away from the political process. As a general rule I obviously concur that that is a sound practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of how we should then deal with section 1316, I know that the honourable member would like his committee to examine this provision to see whether it maintains some relevance. I recall hearing the member for Banks when I was walking into the chamber telling the House of the excellent work which parliamentary committees do. In light of that advice and the honourable member's request, I inform the House that I will be referring this specific question to the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities and asking it to investigate whether this provision in the law should be changed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad the honourable member mentioned acting in a clear and transparent manner because he certainly was not yesterday in this chamber when he directed a question to my colleague the Minister for Finance in which he said, `Will the Minister for Finance confirm the comments made by the Minister for Transport'&mdash;that is me&mdash;`that the government is considering removing fuel excise from the shipping industry, costing $26 million per year?' I said no such thing and well he knows it. I just wanted to get that in in the interests of transparency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member asks me a question that has been on the agenda in the Senate these last few days. I repeat the advice that my colleague Senator Collins has given today in respect of that. He stated that the task of compiling documents on request from the Senate&mdash;we tabled the first list on 19 September in accordance with a notice of motion&mdash;was a truly enormous one. In particular, the exercise to locate and identify all of the documents requested was considerable. It involved searching some 600 files and thus far some 270 documents have been listed for the information of the Senate. Five officers have been involved full time, as have a number on a less than full-time basis, to identify relevant documents. The government has in good faith made the results of that search available to the Senate as soon as possible in accordance with the Senate's wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, each of these documents in terms of their content will need to be carefully considered in respect of issues of commercial confidentiality or cabinet confidentiality.

The fact is that I asked for that document to be made available subject to the commercial-in-confidence requirements that are upon us as a result of the agreements between ANL and its partners. It was made available and I have been very open about the process. If opposition members want to have access to commercial-in-confidence information, one would need to have a lot more confidence in how they would use that information than one could have on the basis of their record so far. On that basis, it is not my intention to make the rest of the report available to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that this is a program which is capturing the imagination of everybody in the community. The 50th anniversary of the end of World War II in 1995 is a moment in history which cannot go unnoticed and which should be commemorated by the Australian people. As a result, I have arranged to set up throughout Australia a number of state based committees&mdash;I have given them some funding as well&mdash;to enable them to coordinate a series of commemorative activities throughout the whole period, particularly during January, and to commemorate the 50th anniversary of victory in the Pacific in August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already been to all of these states and territories and have arranged to launch the committees. I have appointed chairpersons in each of the states and there is a great deal of enthusiasm everywhere. I was in Adelaide only the other day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, what I would like to ensure is that the people of that era&mdash;those people who should be known as the heroic generation of the time, who went through a depression and later six years of world war&mdash;are adequately remembered by those who have been left the legacy of a free country and a good standard of living. I think the best way to do that is to ensure that everybody in Australia&mdash;the whole 17 million-plus people in this country&mdash;has an opportunity to say `thank you' and to remember them. We will ensure that everyone&mdash;whether they live in the city, in the country or in places such as Queenstown in northern Tasmania&mdash;is given that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I have requested all my parliamentary colleagues in the House of Representatives&mdash;the whole 147 of them&mdash;to set up and coordinate local Australia Remembers committees in their federal divisions. I thought it would be better to do it that way than to ask all the local authorities&mdash;almost 1,000 of them&mdash;to do the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written to all members of this House and I have asked them how they can best arrange their coordinating committees. I have asked them to make sure that they invite people from service clubs and schools, not just people from RSLs. This is not necessarily something for just the ex-service community to be involved in: we should try to involve the whole community. I have made sure that each committee will get some seeding funds. As a result, each local Australia Remembers committee can apply through its local member, as the facilitator, for up to $20,000, and that is supposed to be only seeding funds.</PARA>

Average Australian families probably never make a bigger investment than in the building of their own homes. There have been some terrible problems in the home building industry. Most builders are not unfair and unjust, but certainly the problems are caused by those builders who are. The effect on consumers is savage and can be ruinous for a family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has tried to take the lead in this area. The Trade Practices Commission instituted an inquiry last year resulting in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home building: consumer problems and solutions</EMPHASIS>. The TPC found a number of major problems in this industry, including contract conditions, lack of information, difficulties over insurance. But by far the biggest problem was the mandatory arbitration clause in contracts, which is inherently biased against consumers and favours builders. The difficulty here is that all these problems have to be addressed by state governments. I have consistently asked state governments to address this issue. The Queensland government, I am pleased to say, has a very progressive system in this area but other governments do not seem to have acted with the same sense of urgency, even though the problems are absolutely massive for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the ministerial council in 1993, I pointed out the work that had been done by the Trade Practices Commission and asked for action. At the ministerial council this year, there was no indication of progress. This is a matter of concern and anger to consumers. This year the state ministers did agree to report to the next meeting of the ministerial council on what developments had occurred, but that hardly gives an indication of the urgency of the problem being addressed. I have raised the matter with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing and Regional Development to see whether at a federal level we can investigate ways in which we can help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To sum up: home building is a terrible trap for unwary consumers; state governments have the responsibility in this area; the federal government has put proposals to every state government asking them to indicate how they can help in this way and it is very disappointed with the progress so far. But, of course, we will press on in the interest of consumers.</PARA>

However, inasmuch as that difficulty is one which is clearly before the government, I think we do have advice&mdash;and I am now going from recollection; I think it may have been advice which is also mentioned in the Turnbull report&mdash;that the referendum proposal, in order to enable Australia to become a republic, could in fact also cover the states at that same time.

I know that this is an issue of great interest to Queensland members not only from my side of the House but also from the opposition side, particularly the member for McPherson and the member for Maranoa, who, with respect to other repatriation hospitals, kept asking, `What about Greenslopes?' The member for McPherson is indicating that it was him. I will tell him about Greenslopes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is that we have a successful tenderer. There were three tenderers, two of whom were very close in terms of non-financial considerations: service to veterans and quality of care. The Ramsay Health Care Group was the best, marginally, in terms of financial and non-financial considerations. It has agreed that, as from 6 January next year, it will take the hospital over. I am very comfortable with that particular company. In February of this year, it took over the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Western Australia. During that time, not once have I received a ministerial or letter of complaint on the standard of care at Hollywood Repatriation Hospital. I have been given personal assurances in writing. The owner of the Australian privately owned company, Paul Ramsay, who was also present at the announcement, has assured me of the guarantee asked for by the honourable member&mdash;namely, that health services to the veterans will still be as good. He has given me that assurance, and I accept it. I am told that they will probably be even better.</PARA>

In terms of accessibility, I have been assured that the Queensland veteran community, consisting of 67,000 people, is entitled to receive priority of access to that hospital. I am very happy that that group is going to take the hospital over. I am sure that it will work. The Queensland treatment monitoring committee, which is made up of ex-service organisations, will oversee the transitional period, and I am sure it will let me know if anything goes wrong. I would be very happy for Queensland members in this House to let me know of any problems associated with the hospital, and I will certainly look at them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Honourable members will recall that on 24 March this year I provided the House with details of the government's response at that time to allegations that Telecom had monitored and recorded telephone conversations of certain customers without their consent. I indicated at that time that I would report back to honourable members on all of these matters. On 29 August, Senator Bourne tabled a number of documents in the Senate concerning these and other issues related to Telecom's performance of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my statement today is to report progress on Telecom network and customer issues, including those raised by Senator Bourne. I also wish to inform the House of government initiatives to expedite the basic goals of ensuring that all Australians have access to a telephone service that is affordable and that works to world-class standards and that our telephone carriers conform to the highest standards of ethical behaviour and customer service. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Police Investigations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criminal investigation into allegations that Telecom had recorded phone calls of certain customers without their consent, which I initiated in January, is still being finalised. I understand that the report of the Australian Federal Police investigating team is under examination by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The later allegations by Mr Robert Bray that his telephone conversations were monitored without his consent also remain under investigation. It is important that nothing is said or done which would in any way attempt to intervene or pre-empt the finding of these investigations. I can, however, assure honourable members that the government will take whatever action is necessary arising from the completion of these investigations. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Network and Customer Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the government's further initiatives, let me first deal with the performance of the telephone network. It is essential that the overall performance of each of Australia's carrier networks is of a high standard and meets consumer expectations. Carrier network performance should be measured independently against appropriate minimum standards that apply to residential and business customers and metropolitan and country residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will ask Austel to accelerate its current development of end-to-end network performance standards with a view to having these in place by early 1995. The Austel network performance standards will be mandatory, and failure to comply with these standards will be a breach of the carriers' licence conditions. Austel will monitor performance against these standards and will also review them to ensure that they reflect the changing telecommunications environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, and will continue to be, consumer input to this process through Austel's standards advisory committee. In addition, Austel will improve the information content of its quarterly report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality of service</EMPHASIS>. This development will focus on switched telephone network performance for customers and will seek to provide information on a wider range of services and quality of service measures than presently reported. Austel intends to consult with consumers and major users in this development. Austel will develop a capability independent of the carriers to monitor compliance with these mandatory standards and it will be empowered to appoint independent consultants to carry out these tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important issue is the ongoing modernisation of telecommunications networks in Australia, including that of Telecom. Telecom has previously developed a major upgrading of its telephone network. To ensure that upgrading proceeds on an equitable basis, the Commonwealth will enter into a formal network development deed with Telecom which is broadly comparable to existing network development deeds with Optus and Vodafone. Targets will be set in consultation with Telecom and Austel, with priority being given to digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for negotiation of the deed will be threefold: firstly, Telecom's future mode of operation, the FMO plan, which provides for expenditure of $3.3 billion over the next five years; secondly, the recommendations of Austel's April 1994 COT report for network modernisation; and, thirdly, the existing commitments to roll out of calling line identification, or CLI, capability. This network development deed will be commercial-in-confidence, as are the Optus and Vodafone network development deeds. It will, however, include an annex outlining the major developments, and this will be tabled in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is also room for improvement in Telecom's relations with its customers. A positive, non-adversarial approach is obviously preferable. I have previously welcomed Telecom's decision to implement the recommendations of Austel's report on the COT cases, particularly those recommendations on customer complaints. Austel has already reported that Telecom is instituting new customer complaint handling procedures as recommended by the independent Coopers and Lybrand study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Telecom will be asked to produce quickly a customer charter detailing, in plain English, what Telecom's customers are entitled to expect in terms of service. It will include clear information on the position with regard to liability, compensation and customer privacy. Telecom will settle appropriate wording for the charter with Austel, the Trade Practices Commission and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. The charter will be effectively communicated to customers through bill inserts, public advertisements and other means after consultation with consumer groups and relevant government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of equal importance, internal staff training will emphasise the importance of the charter to Telecom staff, with particular emphasis being placed on the representation of liability and customer privacy. I will also be encouraging the other carriers to follow Telecom's example and adopt a customer charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that I have expressed concern that cost remains a barrier preventing many Australians from having a home telephone service. New measures to deal with affordability are currently being discussed with Telecom in consultation with consumer and welfare groups, and I will be announcing details shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the telecommunications regulator, Austel, has adequate resources to deal with consumer complaints. To this end, I have requested that Austel establish a special unit, headed by a general manager reporting to a designated Austel member, to manage network performance issues, quality of service and customer complaints about difficult network faults and related privacy issues. This unit will meet with complainants on a regular basis and endeavour to ensure that all matters are dealt with quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern has been expressed about the carriers' liability for their actions. Telecom's statutory immunity from suit was removed completely by the Telecommunications Act 1991; that is, it is now in no more nor less favourable a situation than other carriers in Australia or, indeed, other companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom will be asked to expedite the implementation of relevant recommendations in Austel's COT report to ensure that it does not misrepresent the extent of its liability to its customers. This will be done through revised instructions to staff, internal training and appropriate public information, including the proposed customer charter, with Austel overseeing this process through the new unit I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel will shortly commence a public inquiry into the setting of limits on amounts recoverable in tort in relation to an act done, or an omission made, in relation to the supply of a specified basic carriage service. This will enable all interested parties to make submissions on the practical application of carrier liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protection of customer privacy by telecommunications carriers is an issue of the gravest concern to the government. We are determined that this will be reflected in the policies and actions of the carriers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that in January I asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to review the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees. As a result, the Attorney-General will be introducing amendments to the act to clarify the exemption for carrier employees. I am pleased to say that the stringent new privacy guidelines developed by Telecom at my request and in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner have now been adopted by Optus and Vodafone as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom's proposed external audit of its privacy policy will be published as well as tabled in the parliament and made available to Austel for prior scrutiny. I have also asked Telecom to open discussions with the relevant unions to achieve amendments to the necessary awards to allow any internal Telecom disciplinary proceedings involving allegations of privacy breaches, including allegations of voice monitoring and recording, to be required to be chaired by an independent party. In addition, Telecom will be asked to appoint an independent party to review existing disciplinary procedures, including those that should apply to all levels of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the allegations of Mr Bray, I have asked the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to review the privacy aspects of those allegations, particularly in relation to Telecom's privacy guidelines. Broader privacy issues will be able to be considered by the Austel Privacy Advisory Committee that I announced recently. I have asked that priority be given to the disclosure of customer information, particularly silent number information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the Freedom of Information Act by the COT complainants during the arbitration process disclosed the need for Telecom to review how it dealt with FOI requests. Telecom will be asked to ensure full implementation of the major reforms to its freedom of information procedures that were indicated as a result of that review. Such implementation is already under way, including centralised control to ensure prompt handling of requests, a network of FOI coordinators, standardised handling procedures and improved staff training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be indicating to Telecom that I would expect it would implement any recommendations that the Commonwealth Ombudsman might make with regard to administration of the FOI Act. I am advised that the fast-track arbitration procedures for the first four COT cases have been settled and the secondary arbitration procedures for the next 11 COT-type cases have been substantially settled. I will ask the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to report to me, on conclusion of the arbitration, on any findings of general application to the telecommunications industry that he has made as a result of the arbitration process. In establishing whether he can make any findings, he will consult with the arbitrator and the other consultants involved in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the permanent arbitration procedures for settling claims, Telecom will be asked to finalise the rules for these as a matter of priority. Austel's quarterly reports on COT implementation and carrier quality of service will be tabled in the parliament, and I will table Austel's first quarterly COT report and the quality of service report for the March 1994 quarter at the end of my statement. After the receipt of each COT quarterly report, I propose to request the chairman of Telecom to detail measures to address any concerns which Austel has identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's recent reforms to government business enterprise reporting and operating arrangements have increased GBE accountability, and I am discussing with members of the Telecom board ways of enhancing their reporting arrangements to government. I can assure honourable members that the government is committed to having all of these network and customer issues dealt with in a positive and open manner. I am confident that the arrangements I have detailed here will ensure this happens, and will provide proper parliamentary scrutiny of Telecom's future actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to thank Senator Bourne for raising her concerns about Telecom's service performance and for assisting the government to respond to the needs and concerns of Telecom's customers. For the information of honourable members, I present the first quarterly report on progress of Telecom's implementation of recommendations of Austel's COT cases report and Austel's quality of service bulletin for the 1994 March quarter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has obviously become another matter of some controversy for the Labor government&mdash;the second time around, as a matter of fact. I know that, for those members who were present in the last parliament, there is a certain amount of deja vu in the way in which WA Inc. has come back to bite at the Labor Party in federal government. I would like to refer to the answer given yesterday by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) to a question asked by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). As honourable members may recall, the honourable member for Tangney asked the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the point of view of a donor to a campaign fund, what is the difference between a candidate using campaign funds for the purpose of paying the candidate's private debts, for which Parker was convicted of stealing, and a party using campaign funds to pay the candidate's private debts?</PARA>
<PARA>In his answer, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no knowledge of the facts of the matter raised by the honourable member, but I will certainly have those investigated. It may well be that there has been some breach of the legislation so far as third parties failing to file returns is concerned. As far as I am concerned, a payment that is not related to an election is obviously not something that should be included in the return.</PARA>
<PARA>Having seen that response in black and white in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I took the trouble to look at the Commonwealth Electoral Act and, in particular, section 314AB, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to this Division, the agent of each registered political party and of each State branch of each registered political party must, within 20 weeks after the end of each financial year beginning on or after 1 July 1992, furnish to the Electoral Commission a return, in an approved form setting out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the total amount received by, or on behalf of, the party during the financial year, together with the details required by section 314AC; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the total amount paid by, or on behalf of, the party during the financial year, together with the details required by section 314AD; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)the total outstanding amount, as at the end of the financial year, of all debts incurred by, or on behalf of, the party, together with the details required by section 314AE.</PARA>
<PARA>It was of some note yesterday that the minister in the first instance started his question by acknowledging the fact that he was the minister responsible for that particular act. The Electoral Commission was obviously playing for time. The minister did not know. He was not fully aware of the requirements of the act for which he was responsible. It seems logical as a result of some of the activities under the name of WA Inc. and other state Incs on behalf of the Labor Party that the minister is perhaps less than knowledgeable about the requirements of the act. Having seen the behaviour of Labor governments in the various states and, in particular, in Western Australia, it is not surprising that there is such a low level of knowledge of the requirements of the Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About halfway through the last parliament, for those who were here and remember, the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, was obliged to come back into this chamber and apologise for misleading the House over his answer to questions about the now infamous gold tax luncheon. Mr Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I seek your indulgence to correct an answer I gave to the House earlier today and, in doing so, to apologise for my incorrect recollection as to the sequence of events in 1987 involving a decision not to impose a tax on gold . . . when I provided the answer to the House earlier today, my recollection was that the Government had made no firm decision . . . on this matter before the luncheon in question.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know only too well that that admission severely winged the previous Prime Minister at a time when he was being consistently undermined by his then potential successor and now Prime Minister. The gold tax luncheon became infamous for the million dollars that was committed by various business people from Western Australia to the Labor Party, in particular for the re-election of the federal Labor government at the 1987 federal election. Connell said&mdash;he was one of the donors and gave $250,000&mdash;that the donations were like a toll for doing business in Western Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think anybody gives donations to political parties willingly. It certainly has not been my experience.</PARA>
<PARA>He made the point that the money was not a donation; it was more like an extraction. It was no coincidence that 12 weeks after the payment of this particular donation the Western Australian government bailed out Rothwells. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very disappointed that the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) did not come to the subject of the matter of public importance at all, so I will read it to the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for the Government to ensure high standards of accountability, recording of donations and ethical behaviour in the use of political funds.</PARA>
<PARA>That raises two policy issues of significance to this chamber. Firstly, it goes to the regime we have in place for the disclosure of political donations and, secondly, it goes to the requirement of members of parliament to declare their pecuniary interests. You have a gall to come into this place and talk about confidence in the system as a result of those regimes!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the history and the structure of policy on disclosure of political donations that has been before this parliament over the last 10 years. When we were elected to office in 1983 we implemented the first disclosure of political donations regime in this parliament, and you opposed it. You were dragged kicking, shouting, scratching and screaming. You did not want to have one bar of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember who established the Commonwealth regime for disclosure of donations&mdash;we did. You opposed it, and you continued to oppose it in the course of the 1980s. We established the disclosure regime, but you did not accept the spirit of it. You did your best to avoid it. You did your best to evade it. You did your best to ignore it. You did your best to scupper it and scuttle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We discovered a range of loopholes. What did we do? In 1991-92, as a result of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report No. 4, we extended the provisions of the act by way of legislation. What resulted? There was a more effective disclosure of donations regime and you were again dragged there kicking, shouting and screaming. You wanted to rely upon avoidance and evasion and to continue to rort the spirit and the letter of the act and the law. That essentially remains your position today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We established the regime and extended the coverage of the act. The history of the disclosure regime in this parliament is quite simple. We have supported it, we always have, and you have opposed it on every single occasion. We have discovered in the course of work on the joint standing committee that there may well be a further loophole which you are currently taking advantage of, but I will come to that shortly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Forgive me, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let me also make some comments in respect of Western Australia because my Western Australian colleague the member for Moore made some points about our state. What has occurred in Western Australia so far as disclosure of donations is concerned? The Liberal Party in Western Australia through the corrupt state upper house has opposed the establishment of a disclosure of donations regime time and time again. Finally, after the royal commission, it enabled disclosure of political donations legislation to be enacted by the parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That regime was not proclaimed prior to the last state election in Western Australia and it remains unproclaimed to this day. You have sat on that unproclaimed act for 18 months at the state level and you have refused to proclaim it. Why? Because your attitude in this parliament is reflected by your attitude in the Western Australian parliament. You do not support a disclosure of political donations regime. The failure and the refusal at the state level to proclaim that act has been in the face of consistent requests by the opposition in Western Australia to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for your helpful advice on two occasions, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will do my best to follow it. The policy point is quite simply this: at the Commonwealth and state level the opposition has persistently refused to support disclosure of donations legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second policy point goes to the disclosure of pecuniary interests of members of parliament. Again, when we were elected in 1983 we supported the resolution of this House which has the effect that the pecuniary interests of members of parliament be disclosed. What did members on the other side do? You opposed it. When we tried to effect a pecuniary interests disclosure regime for senators, what did you do? You opposed a regime in the Senate that would have had the effect of senators disclosing their pecuniary interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing occurred in Western Australia. In the course of the 1980s the Labor Party in Western Australia introduced into the state parliament legislation which would have had the effect of requiring members of parliament to disclose their pecuniary interests. Repeatedly in the corrupt upper house in Western Australia the Liberal Party opposed and defeated the establishment of that regime.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I refer you and honourable members opposite to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 15 September entitled `ASC demand on Downer company'. The story, written by Christine Wallace, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Federal Opposition, Mr Downer, is a director of a company whose 1990 annual return is still under "requisition" by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) for failure to satisfy all the commission's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>It refers to the Leader of the Opposition's company Marybelle Pty Ltd&mdash;an appropriate name for a company that he is involved with&mdash;and states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Downer also appears to have breached Parliament's pecuniary interests guidelines laid down to shed light on MP's private business interests.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to refer to some of the comments that the Leader of the Opposition has made in respect of the completion of his disclosure of pecuniary interests required by the House resolution. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An underlying resentment to the disclosure process was revealed in the comment made above his signature in 1987:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is an invasion of privacy." Above his signature in the 1986 return is the annotation: "This is a gross invasion of privacy."</PARA>
<PARA>That reflects your attitude. Members opposite will not support a regime which has the effect of requiring effective disclosure of political donations, and they will not support, at either the state or the federal level, the disclosure of pecuniary interests of members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to a worrying possibility that a loophole continues to exist within the disclosure of the political donations regime of which the Liberal Party is currently taking advantage. I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 8 June 1994 headed `Big loopholes for secret funds for political parties'. Tim Dodd writes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Electoral Commission has warned a parliamentary committee of loopholes in the disclosure laws which could allow substantial funds to be secretly channelled to parties without being revealed.</PARA>
<PARA>The article refers to a submission made by the AEC to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, of which I am a member, and further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its submission, the commission said it was possible for a political party to have companies, trusts and organisations that the party controlled or that largely benefited the party. These could be used to channel party transactions not included in the annual return.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the Liberal Party potentially using trusts to avoid the disclosure regime. A further story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 June, referring to the Labor Party's submission and stand on this issue, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Labor's submission also argued for closure of a loophole in the disclosure law which deals with income received by a political party from a trust fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It appears that it is not necessary to disclose donations to a trust fund where the trust fund income is then consumed by a political party while the donation remains untouched," Labor's submission says.</PARA>
<PARA>As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I raised these matters with Mr Lynton Crosby, who is the Deputy Federal Director of the Liberal Party. In the official <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of the hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on Tuesday, 7 June 1994, I asked Mr Crosby the following question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just finishing up on the trust funds, you referred earlier to the legal advice that your party had received on trust funds. Do you know whether your party has received any advice from accountancy firms in respect of the same area?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crosby replied, `I am not aware.' I then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the course of the election period, your party disclosed, I think, something like a million dollars in kind for services provided by accountancy firms including KPMG Peat Marwick. You would not know whether part of those services entailed advice on trust funds?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Crosby answered, `No, I am not aware at all.' Senator Minchin then interjected:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think I can say with confidence that all we got, as we said, was legal advice. It was QC's advice; it was not from an accountant.</PARA>
<PARA>That did not necessarily satisfy us because, on this side of the House, we have the healthy suspicion that the Liberal Party is using trust funds to avoid disclosure. I refer to a pro-forma letter that has come into my possession dated May 1994, addressed to the Free Enterprise Foundation, c/- KPMG Peat Marwick, GPO Box 292, Canberra, ACT, 2601. There is no question that this has all the hallmarks of a suspicious Liberal Party front. The pro-forma letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find enclosed the Company's cheque for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>blank space; fill in your own amount&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">representing a gift to the Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In making this gift the Company requests that the funds represented by it not form part of any gift to a political party or be used for any other political purpose prior to the next Federal Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acknowledgement of this gift in due course would be appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>That is the big loophole that we are now concerned about. Recommendation 6 of the June report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that part XX . . . of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be amended to clearly require disclosure of income received by registered political parties from any trust fund or similar fund or account, where such income is above the disclosable amounts set out in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we suspect you are up to. Do not come in here pretending to have clean hands on this issue or any policy structure or policy integrity in these matters whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore&mdash;my colleague from Western Australia&mdash;made some points about Western Australia. I also want to make a couple of points about Western Australia. Members opposite make reference to the royal commission in Western Australia, but they never make any comment about the failure and refusal of the current Court state government to implement fundamental recommendations of that royal commission. There are a couple of recommendations which are pertinent to this debate, none of which were mentioned by the honourable member for Moore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations contained in the report of the royal commission concerns an inquiry into the pecuniary interests of MPs. No action has been taken on that recommendation whatsoever. A further recommendation of the royal commission in Western Australia was to proclaim the declarations of donations legislation. That has not occurred. The government has refused and sat on the unproclaimed act for 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a media statement issued by the Western Australian shadow minister for electoral reform, Mr Jim McGinty. His press release of 19 September 1994&mdash;just a couple of days ago&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lawrence Government passed the Electoral Amendment (Political Finance) Act 1992 to fix the problem. It is the Liberal Party that has not moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cheryl Edwardes continues to stall on reform and is refusing to proclaim the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition has raised this issue 7 times since the last election and we are still yet to see the Act proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On June 3 1993 Mrs Edwardes said "appropriate action will be taken during the parliamentary sitting" and on September 8 last year she said "the Government will deal with the matter in a proper way as a matter of urgency".</PARA>
<PARA>Over a year has passed and nothing has happened. The honourable member for Moore should not pretend that, in addition to having no policy fabric whatsoever, he comes to this argument with clean hands. Let us have a look at a few things that have been occurring in his local bailiwick. A story on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> entitled `Lib MP's account probe' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police are investigating the possibility of allegedly corrupt payments to former Wanneroo mayor Wayne Bradshaw were cashed through bank accounts controlled by Liberal MLA Wayde Smith.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a state colleague in the very area of the member for Moore. There was a financial inquiry into that state member's financial affairs, which the Premier of that state refused to disclose. On 17 November 1993, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the report was taken out of Mr Court's office by Friday October 29&mdash;the last working day before WA's Freedom of Information Act became law.</PARA>
<PARA>That is your standard of accountability, transparency and openness. You have no policy structure in this area. You have no standing. You do not come to this debate with clean hands, and you have the absolute gall to talk about confidence in the system and disclosure of donations!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will comment very briefly on the suggestions that the WA government is dragging its feet in some way. In Western Australia we have legislation which we want to be perfect because members of the Labor Party have proven that they will do all they can to escape the law. The Liberal Party has nothing to fear from these laws, but the Labor Party does. The federal electoral commissioner has constantly told the Western Australian Attorney-General to hold back on legislation until similar laws are enacted in Canberra. It is also ironic that they failed to mention that Bob Hogg, who was once admitted to the federal Labor Party, also sought to find loopholes in disclosure legislation so that they did not have to make all the declarations required.

Even then, they will try to find some loopholes. The Court government will not provide them with any loopholes. Members opposite trying to deflect criticism to the Liberal Party will not work. It must be remembered that calls for this legislation have come only because the Labor Party is full of corruption.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This past week some very revealing evidence came out of the court case of the former Deputy Premier of Western Australia, David Parker. Mr Parker is today serving a 12-month prison term for his misappropriation of campaign donations. It was revealed during his trial that Parker used campaign donations to pay off personal debts such as the renovation of his kitchen and bathroom, his wife's tax bill and his mortgage. That, it has been decided by the court, is theft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have in prison in Western Australia Mr Parker's former boss, Brian Burke, who was also found guilty of misappropriating funds. I will not comment further on Mr Burke. He is a very close friend of many people opposite, including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but apparently not of the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) because there are other charges pending. The imprisonment of these two criminals is just one chapter in an encyclopaedia of moral and political corruption in the ALP which has permeated that party in the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the trial of David Parker, the President of the Senate, Senator Beahan, who was the secretary of the state ALP at the time these offences were committed, admitted that the ALP committed the same crimes as Parker. Parker is in gaol for using campaign funds to pay for personal expenses including house renovations, his wife's tax bill and his mortgage&mdash;and that was theft, as the court pointed out. During the trial in which Parker was convicted of this misappropriation, Senator Beahan admitted that the ALP&mdash;and in saying `the ALP' I assume he was responsible for he was the administrator of the party at that time&mdash;committed the same offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time Senator Beahan was the administrator, the ALP was committing the crime of theft, quite frankly. The ALP was using campaign funds to pay for the bank overdrafts of candidates, the gambling debts of candidates and holidays for the families of candidates. Parker did similar things, and today he languishes at Her Majesty's pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are very revealing and, quite frankly, worrying admissions which need investigation. In the meantime, Senator Beahan, who has been implicated in this, ought to stand down as President of the Senate. We had members of a political party at the time these offences were occurring administrating the funds of the state which they were governing. The fact is that they could not even legally administer their own campaign donations, so how on earth could they administer the state's funds?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this sorry saga we all know as WA Inc., prominent members of the ALP have been totally supportive of Burke and Parker. In July, Ian Taylor, the Labor leader in Western Australia, professed his love and support for Brian Burke. He did not condemn him for being a crook. He said he loved him. I notice the member for Fremantle said she hardly knew Burke, but I recall when she became the Premier of Western Australia she had David Parker in her backyard supporting her. Her silence has been deafening since Parker was gaoled. I must ask: does she love and support Parker, or does she condemn what he did?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a number of Labor politicians coming out and supporting Burke and Parker, but only one has condemned them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fremantle probably distanced herself from Burke because she was found in a similar situation.

There is currently a loophole in the law, which the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) spoke about before, which has been abused by your side of the House.

A substantial number of one-time citizens of Yugoslavia are resident in Australia, some of whom I believe have returned to Yugoslavia from time to time in order to involve themselves in the conflict. So any suggestion that this law will not be applied in Australia is not true. I sincerely hope that it will not have to be applied. I am not suggesting that any person has been involved. However, it is clear that Australian citizens certainly have had the opportunity to be involved in that conflict and thus could be in a position of being charged in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation is unique. It applies to one of the most tragic situations that I have ever witnessed. Its timing is amazing, considering that next year we will be talking a lot about the Second World War. I commend the government for allocating funds to remind the many Australians who were born after the Second World War of what occurred. I remember the war as a child, although I was too young to be involved as a soldier. However, I was old enough to know that there was great fear in Western Australia as parts of our state were bombed. I experienced trench training and so on when I was at school. Of course, my experience as a child is really as a button off my shirt when compared with that of others who have experienced some of the horrors that have occurred in parts of Yugoslavia in the name of ethnic rights. I think it is tragic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say&mdash;and I would have liked to have said this earlier when it would have been relevant&mdash;that, notwithstanding the difficulties of the terrain and all the other associated issues, I do not think the international community used enough muscle to try to resolve this conflict. Evidence indicates that, every time a little bit of air power has been used, the process of peacemaking has been substantially improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that it is beyond the resources of Australia to settle a dispute of this nature and that we can only rely upon the great powers of Europe, as Yugoslavia is part of that continent, instead of waiting again for the Americans to be involved. I am aware of all the problems associated with retaining peace arrangements with the Soviet Union. But the simple fact is that every time a little bit of superior air power was used massive steps were taken in order to achieve some sort of resolution which saved a lot of people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great tragedies is that international opinion and international power could not be used to save the lives of so many adults and children. I guess one could say that what we are doing today is a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted. Here we are debating a United Nations resolution, a very proper resolution, that just happens to deal with the effects of the conflict&mdash;not the conflict itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a couple of comments about the background to the legislation. I have already drawn to the attention of the House the fact that this is another binding international obligation. As one who criticises many of the so-called binding obligations, I must say that this is what I perceive as the role of the United Nations and particularly its Security Council. But I regret that it was not more positive in its response to this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are finding ourselves passing a unique law in this country which empowers a foreign tribunal to conduct itself on our territory. It may require us to deliver people to other countries in order to provide information to the tribunal. From my understanding of the legislation, a person found guilty may not necessarily be imprisoned on our soil. I am not objecting to any of that. I believe that the only thing worse than war is war crimes. It is most unfortunate that we have a set of rules under which people can go out and kill other people. But, while people continue to do it, we need some laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Charges were laid against a young man who went out and raped and murdered someone. I was horrified that that could happen and be justified by commanding officers and others who, I think, instructed that young man that he could behave in that way, as opposed to telling him to behave in that way. We thought that we saw the end of that sort of behaviour with the holocaust, yet there are grave similarities; it is just that in this case gas chambers were not used. These things sadden me considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the member for Banks (Mr Melham) said something with which I agree wholeheartedly. I will have to watch out; my reputation will be in tatters if I keep this up much longer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Banks might be worried about this, but I will use his words to my advantage. During his remarks he said that we have one of the best democracies in the world. I would say that, notwithstanding my concerns in a certain area, that is absolutely true. I recently said that we have one of the most highly developed democracies in the world, which is probably closer to what the member for Banks wanted to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do we constantly feel obliged to make promises to the rest of the world in some formal convention or treaty when we do not need to? We could say, `Wait a minute. Our democracy and our democratic development are such that you don't have to ask us that question; we've done it. We are a country that practises democracy in as advanced a state as anywhere.' We do not need to make promises to parts of the world which have not recognised, for instance, that it is grossly unfair, if not improper, to employ five-year-olds or to enslave people. Why should we be the first in the queue to commit ourselves to some of these issues in a way that eventually has implications on our own law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary told us one of the reasons why we have to pass this legislation. I am sure the government is presenting the bill to the parliament with the best possible principles, because it stands where I stand on the issue of war crimes. But the government is telling us that, because of a commitment made to the United Nations and because of our involvement with the Security Council, this House has no choice but to pass this legislation. As I said, I have no objection to the legislation. But I am concerned that Australia is progressively going to this international organisation, signing conventions on issues which, in most cases, we have addressed decades ago or which we have the full capacity to address at any time should public opinion decide that we are recalcitrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need to sign conventions with other countries to be told that we have to do something about particular issues. That point is fundamental to this debate. I know at times that people come in here and smirkingly say, `I am bringing in this law to meet an international obligation, but ha, ha, I've got you.' That is probably the lowest aspect of this issue. I do not like the deals we do with other countries around the world being used to override the fundamental constitutional laws of Australia because I believe that we have a provision for that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our democratic process says very clearly how we will address our constitution if the people of Australia are unhappy with its provisions. It is not set in concrete. We should not go away and commit ourselves. It is almost an admission that we are not good enough and that we really do not know how to run our country. We are making a promise to the rest of the world that we will be better children when we lead the world in human rights and in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting how these laws that we accept from the United Nations can be administered and interpreted differently in different countries. An issue we will have before us here shortly relating to Tasmania is apparently a major problem in our eyes. However, a law to cover it applies to the majority of states in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to comment on the rights or wrongs of the legislation. But why did that international body, in criticising Australia in this way, not have something to say about the great big United States, the USA? The reason might be that the USA pays the bills. But we have to look at the fundamentals of this. Why, as a small country, do we put  ourselves in a position where we can get instructions from afar? These conventions become quite concerning, because they can be abused&mdash;as any law will be abused&mdash;if it is in somebody else's interests to find a way to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, we are contemplating desertification legislation, having just fought our way out&mdash;in a minuscule way, I guess&mdash;of the outrageous approach that the world community took to agricultural trade, which is at least now included in the GATT. Having many battles before us, we are now seriously considering handing to a committee of the United Nations the power to tell us how much land we might farm. We could be back here in a matter of years confronted with some legislation, the purpose of which the minister might tell us is to enable Australia to comply with binding international obligations. We will not have to worry about drought relief. We will have to close down pastoral properties because somebody has taken some aerial photographs or somebody in another agricultural producing country has thought it a damned good idea to reduce the competitiveness of highly efficient Australian farmers. To me, that is silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubly silly on the grounds that we are pretty capable managers. We do take account of these sorts of circumstances. If everybody believes the claim of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), which is that we have a right to independence, the decision to close farming land should be kept as a decision of this parliament and, possibly more importantly, of the people who elect us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already signed the atmospheric pollution convention. We now find ourselves being confronted with whether we have an obligation&mdash;we probably do&mdash;to tax our own industries or deny them carbon power. Anything generated with a hydrocarbon should be increased in cost in some way. We do not want people to use it because we have agreed that we should not pollute the atmosphere. That is fine, but a lot of our trade competitors will not bother about it or are too big and mighty to be bullied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might wonder how many people will be out of a job in time because we made a commitment to the world with a lot of hype. There was a lovely warm glow and lovely feeling for the minister in this case as she walked on to the podium and was applauded. She added a signature to something that read pretty well until she came back here in the face of cold, hard reality and asked herself what it would cost Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make any outlandish comments as to what it might cost Australia. But it is clear that we are now under international pressure to meet our promises and reduce our economic activity unless we can find some other form of power generation. It is a bit of a worry. The greenies do not like hydro-electric energy any more. Even Peter Walsh tells us that it is probably the cleanest energy form. Everybody is dead frightened of nuclear energy. I know about solar power and all those sorts of things, but you cannot run a factory on solar cells. You cannot create significant jobs with it. You can run a little pump or an electric fence or something. The serious question is how we get around that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very interesting because it deals with the courts. Concern was expressed in the second reading speech as to how far this tribunal might seek to go. We are conceding great powers to a body that is a bit out of our control. But the courts are out of our control, and properly so. They are getting a momentum of their own. I drew to Mr Speaker's attention&mdash;I wanted to make sure the Attorney-General knew about it&mdash;a case recently lost by the Commonwealth where a convicted drug importer was able to defeat a deportation order on the grounds that he would be leaving behind his two Australian born children and that that would be to their disadvantage. The judge ruled that he was right and that if the Commonwealth were to deport him it would be in contravention of its promises and commitment to the international community under the rights of the child convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told&mdash;I have heard Attorneys-General in this place stand up and tell us&mdash;that we really do not have to worry about these warm, fuzzy glow conventions we sign every now and again because they have no meaning in Australia until we write a law. There is no law that says that convicted drug importers should not be deported because of the international convention on the rights of the child. As I said, the law has a momentum of its own. I wonder whether that was the intention of the government at the time it signed it. Did it believe its own rhetoric that we did not really have to worry about this warm, fuzzy glow stuff because it did not really have any effect until we passed a law here in Australia? It clearly does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has a lot to do not so much with what you might do as what you cannot do. I am very worried that we might shortly be committed to something that says we cannot farm, or certainly farm to the extent that we do today. I take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the government the question of whether it is right. The other conventions are signed, and we bear their problems. I agree that they were not all signed by Labor governments. But it does not change the fact that we often make commitments. This is another one, and it has my endorsement. Treaties are about national security and things of that nature, where the executive should have the power. You cannot debate a treaty defence while your enemy is knocking at the door. But we have gone too far. I warn the House that, in talking with governments, we should be pretty careful. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 is concerned with the moral basis of our nation. This matter has received a great deal of discussion in our community and generated tremendous passions. It would be useful for the House and the public record for the background of this matter to be laid out clearly and concisely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 in the USA, a certain Conrad Kalejs was arrested by the American authorities. The US courts were satisfied that Mr Kalejs had falsified his immigration application to the USA in respect of his record of activity in eastern Europe during the Second World War. As Mr Kalejs had migrated to the US from Australia, he was deported to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time&mdash;in 1985&mdash;there was no legislative basis for dealing with the mass murderers of the Nazi holocaust who were hiding in Australia. In early 1986, a series of meetings were held between political leaders of all parties and the organised communities from eastern Europe. Representatives of the Jewish, Ukrainian, Polish, Croatian and other Baltic communities agreed unanimously that, after the Kalejs affair, Australia was duty bound to consider all options to deal with individuals who have war records that make them unacceptable to Australia's multicultural society and democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US courts accepted that Conrad Kalejs was a member of an auxiliary police force that assisted Nazis in murdering Jews. Members of the House will remember that this race policy was Hitler's primary war aim and the pursuit of it was carried on to the bitter end, contrary to even the most basic military considerations of conducting war. Vital resources, especially of transport, were denied the German army in pursuit of the primary Nazi policy of exterminating the Jewish people. Thousands of persons, male and female, outside Germany were prepared to assist the Nazis in these horrors. Conrad Kalejs was one, and in 1985 Australia was unprepared to deal with this political and moral crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many voices are raised against the existence of this legislation. I am willing to accept that most criticism may be based on a view of law which precludes victors putting the vanquished on trial. The key point in this view is that both sides in war end up committing atrocities, yet only the vanquished are sent to trial. No-one can deny that atrocities were committed by the allies. The bombing of British and German civilians in their homes, as distinct from war supply factories, was a grievous atrocity perpetrated by both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the shock in May 1945 of the full extent of Nazi crimes was so overwhelming and extraordinary that public opinion in the world demanded the punishment of the leadership of Nazi Germany. Members of the House will remember that, although bombing civilians can easily and truthfully be classified as an atrocity, no German was charged with bombing London, Antwerp or Warsaw. The charges related primarily to the Nazi policy of genocide, and this genocide was directed towards the Jewish people in response to Hitler's clearly stated anti-Semitism. From Hitler's first report as a political officer in the German army in 1919 to his last testament written in the bunker in April 1945, anti-Semitism was the guiding, motivating and invigorating idea that consumed his entire political and social world. Australia entered into this world of horrors because we became a refuge for some of Hitler's henchmen and henchwomen after 1945. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today has its foundations in the sad fact that we have been a successful place for some Nazis to take refuge. This fact will encourage those in the former Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia who, in the last few years since the death of Marshall Tito, have been engaging in genocide during the wars currently taking place in that part of the world. The moral and intellectual argumentation  concerning the right of legal redress against genocide is founded on the Nuremberg trials. Australia accepts these principles because we participated in a similar set of trials in connection with the war in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, there are some people who are so morally perverted and full of vile hatreds and anti-Semitism that they attempt to deny the appalling history of the Second World War. I think that this House should fight against these revisionists and crypto-Nazis. Members should be clear in their denunciation of the shocking crimes of the Second World War and the atrocities of the former Yugoslavia. Members should not give any comfort to these liars and degenerates, such as the League of Rights and David Irving, in inadvertently giving any credence to their spurious claims concerning the crimes of the Nazis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of race murder&mdash;called ethnic cleansing&mdash;is one of the most appalling facets of 20th century life. We are all familiar with the television scenes of the horrors in Bosnia. We are all aware of the accusations made by all of the participating sides against every other side. Everyone is accusing everyone else of war crimes and, sadly, most accusations will be true. This legislation before us today will enable Australia to protect itself against being a refuge for genocidal murderers escaping from the Balkans to the suburbs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the funding of this matter is of serious concern to government members. Our previous experience in the field was very expensive and inconclusive in court. Whilst money considerations are important, I urge the House to remember that we are a multicultural society, with people  drawn from over a hundred countries, and we must have a legal framework that is conducive to internal peace and order within Australia. As all honourable members know, we have many Australians of Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian descent and, in the years to come when the Balkan crisis has cooled down, there will still be the memories of the lost loved ones. Many of these dead are victims, not just of war, but of ethnic cleansing&mdash;racial genocide. The families of these victims will never forget. Our peace and good order require that we do not have a situation where people who perpetrated atrocities can come to Australia and just walk away from their crimes. The existence of such people in Australia will be a major disturbance to survivors and their families in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a duty to have laws which will enable us to deal quickly with any situation that may involve Australia being used as a refuge by people who have serious accusations to answer. Whilst money is important, our moral standing is also of serious and long-term importance. This parliament has a duty to protect our reputation in this most serious matter. Of course, there are some legal problems that have to be dealt with, related principally to the question of territoriality. Some argue that war crimes are essentially matters of domestic concern and that any trial should take place where the crime was committed. This situation was generally the norm after 1945, and the governments in eastern Europe tried and sentenced&mdash;often to death&mdash;Germans and other non-nationals for atrocities committed in Poland, Russia and other places. Governments in these countries also tried their own nationals  and executed many people for their activities during the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy was possible because the allies won the war. In former Yugoslavia, many of the people who have been branded internationally as war criminals are still in positions of power in their countries, and they appear unlikely to lose office as a result of any warfare. This creates a problem of justice. Surely criminals cannot be allowed to avoid court simply because they still have a place to hide. Obtaining evidence and documents vital for court proceedings will be very difficult in relation to the Yugoslav crisis. However, the crimes are disgraceful and we must have a process whereby we can take action if we decide to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laws we have on this matter are laws in defence of human rights. The post Second World War society has been increasingly attuned to human rights. Today, we see violations of human rights as a danger to world peace. International communications are such that enormous crimes can be televised into homes around the world within an hour. This fact will result in a great disturbance to the peace of the world. It therefore follows that nations individually and collectively through the UN will seek to act against serious violations of human rights anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, before it arrived here today, was examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee chairman, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), has done an excellent job and helped significantly to clarify and sharpen our response in this most important and difficult matter. I would like to speak to a few of the more pressing points in the report and the draft legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International War Crimes Tribunal has been established by United Nations Security Council resolution 827 and a subsequent statute. Australia is party to this establishment, and the tribunal will be empowered by this legislation to sit in Australia, receive assistance from Australian legal authorities and have its forfeiture orders enforced by Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 of the bill defines the tribunal as `the international tribunal for the prosecution of war criminals from the former Yugoslavia or any of its associated organs.' Thus this bill is only concerned with Yugoslavia. Evidence of genocide elsewhere cannot be dealt with by this bill when it is enacted. This narrowness of definition is not a good thing. Unfortunately, the crimes in the Balkans are not the last example of anti-human atrocities. We can confidently expect more in the future. Perhaps the Attorney-General could look at the question of empowering an Australian court to deal with any accusations of atrocities against human rights brought against a person within the legal jurisdiction of Australia. No-one here would be happy to see a person in Australia accused in relation to the genocide in Rwanda go free because there was no competent court to deal with that person in Australia. This is a problem for the future. It is a real problem, and I am confident that we will have to face it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 of the bill will require that a person arrested under it be brought before a magistrate and that the magistrate must be satisfied that the person before the bench is in fact the person named in the warrant. This question of identity is a central point to all recent trials of war criminals connected with the second world war. It is interesting to note that no accused ever denies the charges; they always deny that they are the person named in the warrant. In future years, when this legislation is used to prosecute someone in Australia they will also deny not their crime but their identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural justice requires that serious efforts be made to avoid accusing an innocent person, and the benefit of doubt in questions of identity must always be resolved in favour of the accused. This bill is about justice, not vengeance. The bill incorporates a recommendation from the Melham committee that a specific statutory scheme for legal aid be included in the bill. The government recommends that applications for assistance be directed to the Attorney-General, who may determine whether legal aid is to be granted. This provision is necessary as an accused may be a person of modest means, wholly unprepared financially to meet such serious court costs. As all matters dealt with by this bill when it becomes legislation will be involved with genocide and the worst kind of horrors, we must not allow procedural delays based on money to disrupt the quick settlement of the accusations brought against any defendants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advisory committee chaired by the member for Banks recommended a sunset clause. The government has rejected this recommendation in favour of a review in five years time. I believe that this is wise. Our need for national order and regularity in the country, with many people from lands disturbed by war, means that the government must not tie its own hands in relation to matters which 10 years hence may create major social disruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assume that no-one in this House has family who have been subjected to any of the horrors of the wars in the Balkans, but certainly many of us have constituents who have suffered directly and indirectly. We must use our imaginations and not think that these matters are like football; that everything is over when the whistle blows. The horrors of genocide, be it in Nazi Europe, former  Yugoslavia, Rwanda or anywhere in the world, never leave the victims while they live, nor their families, for generations. Our legislation should realise this and we should be prepared to deal with these matters over the long term. The effects of genocide are certainly long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I would ask the House to remember the unbelievable horrors of the Nazi holocaust and believe that a repeat is possible. Remember Pol Pot in Cambodia. Remember Rwanda in 1994. Remember Bosnia as we speak. The trial of the Nazi leaders at Nuremberg was not held just to establish their guilt and to decide whether to punish them for committing crimes; it was part of a search for a better way to control those strong human impulses of aggression and revenge. It was an attempt to replace violence with an acceptable and effective rule of human behaviour, a rule of law. When the eight judges of the military tribunal entered the Nuremberg courtroom at 10 o'clock on 30 September 1946 more was expected of them than a judgment on 22 individuals. In bringing those Nazi leaders to judgment, some hoped for vengeance, some for a just basis for a post-war settlement of Europe. Others hoped for a solution to problems which have plagued civilised nations for centuries. With this bill, Australia in a small way becomes part of this solution. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill and the International War Crimes Tribunal (Consequential Amendments) Bill. Members will recall that the bills were referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs by the Attorney-General. I hasten to add that it was at my suggestion in my former capacity as shadow Attorney-General that that was done. I spoke briefly on 30 June when the committee report was tabled. I am very pleased to be able to speak now, when the government's response has been received and the bills have been amended in accordance with the committee report and the government's response to it. I welcome the government's response because it generally accepts the committee's recommendations. I think there is only one recommendation not accepted, which is not on the face of it a matter of huge consequence, and one recommendation that is only partially accepted. That is a matter on which I will comment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that the quality of the report and the response of the government to it reflect well on the decision that the matter should be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I said at the time of the tabling of the report, those involved in the preparation of the report are to be commended. At that time the chairman made particular mention of the staff who had been involved. I think it needs also to be mentioned that the quality of an advisory committee report on a bill will frequently be a direct reflection of the quality of the evidence offered by the witnesses. In this case, as in the case of the report on the child sex tourism legislation, the quality of the input from the witnesses who proffered advice to the committee was very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of the legislation is to enable persons alleged to have committed crimes against humanitarian law in the former state of Yugoslavia since 1991 to be surrendered to the international tribunal in the Hague for the purposes of trial. The bill basically is a procedural one, setting out the means by which a person who is a citizen or resident or temporarily in Australia can be arrested and surrendered to the tribunal. In the making of the reference to the standing committee, and in the proceedings before the standing committee, it was the unanimously agreed object of those involved to ensure that the procedures were appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a serious matter that one country would surrender a citizen, a resident or a person within its territory to an authority outside that territory, and appropriate safeguards are necessary to ensure that the arrest and surrender are not arbitrary. The bill in amended form will largely reflect the committee's view of what safeguards are appropriate. It will take into account the sorts of safeguards that are applied under the extradition act, although it will not be a direct mirror of extradition act provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to only three recommendations of the committee. Recommendation 10 recommends that a provision requiring an additional step between the initial remanding of a person and the Attorney-General's surrender decision be inserted into the bill. The committee recommended that it should require a person to be brought before a magistrate, who must determine whether a person is eligible for surrender. The criteria should be that the magistrate is satisfied that the person is the person named in the tribunal warrant and that the alleged offence for which surrender is sought falls within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making that recommendation, the committee had regard to legislation or draft legislation of other countries that were responding to the security council resolution establishing the international tribunal. In paragraph 1.8.2 of its report, the committee refers in particular to legislation in Italy under which there was an appeal to a court which could address the question of physical identity, a matter that the government accepts is appropriate to address, and then the question of whether the surrender request is in relation to a matter which falls within the temporal&mdash;that is, the time&mdash;and territorial jurisdiction of the international tribunal. The committee also referred to proposed legislation in the Netherlands under which surrender could be refused on the identity ground but also on the ground that surrender has been requested for offences over which, under the terms of its statute, the tribunal has obviously no jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendation has been accepted in so far as the magistrate involved in the remanding may address the question of the identity but not accept the question of jurisdiction. In its response, the government points out that, under the rules of the tribunal, jurisdiction can be dealt with before the tribunal. I for one accept that it is appropriate that issues of jurisdiction should be dealt with by the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end it may not matter much that the particular point made by the committee has not been picked up. I say that because in another recommendation to which I will come in due course, recommendation 21, the government has accepted a recommendation that the process be subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. While I am certainly not going to offer any legal opinion on the point, there is an issue of whether a request for the surrender of a person which, on its face, shows allegation of an offence outside the time, or outside the tribunal's territorial jurisdiction, is a request to which Australia can respond. This issue may well be ventilated on a judicial review application. I do not know the precise answer at this point. I have not made the study, but the recommendation, I think, was a reasonable one. For my part, I would prefer it to have been adopted. It would only involve the rejection of a request which, on the face of it, was obviously defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 20, which the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) referred to, provided that further consideration be given to developing an appropriate sunset clause in relation to the legislation. The government has pointed out in its response that there are difficulties in developing an appropriate sunset clause and has in fact responded positively to the recommendation in giving further consideration as requested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has decided against a sunset clause, but has undertaken to cooperate with parliament in conducting a review of the legislation, including the continued need for it, five years after commencement. I do not know what bring-up mechanism the clerk operates within the parliament, but I would strongly recommend that there be put down, for a date five years after the commencement, a reminder that the parliament has an undertaking from the government to undertake such a review. I doubt, with the sorts of schedules most members have, that many, if any, would remember to conduct the review or to raise the matter of the review five years after the commencement of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last recommendation to which I invite attention is recommendation 21, relating to the application of the judicial review act. The judicial review act has become one of a very important group of sources of potential remedy available to a citizen in dealing with the government. It is a process which has proven invaluable in most areas in which it has been exercised. It has been exercised across a wide range of administrative decisions under Commonwealth statutes. In the light of the experience of judicial review, there should, I think, be a very good public interest case made out for excluding it before any enactment should include a provision eliminating judicial review or even restricting it. I am very pleased that the government has decided, after careful consideration of the recommendations of the committee, that this is not such a case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make only two more comments. One is a specific comment related to legislation in general and the other relates to this particular legislation. This particular bill is a very special one in the respect that it deals with allegations of crime committed overseas and what may be done with persons within Australia who are alleged to have committed those crimes. In other respects it is yet another bill coming before the parliament in which the citizen is to be subjected to the coercive powers of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had quite a range of bills in the last 12 months, some dealing with what might be described in broad terms as police powers&mdash;powers of entry, search, seizure and arrest and intrusion in the form of telephone tapping and similar exercises. We have had a number of bills in which there are coercive powers of a more regulatory nature involving perhaps entry to premises, inspection, examination, copy or seizure of documents, and interrogation of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular legislation emanates from the Attorney-General's Department, as has some of the legislation to which I have referred generally. The introduction in the legislation of coercive powers is, of course, nothing new and has been on the statute books for as long as there has been legislation, but the intrusions that are now being authorised by the parliament are beginning to become very widespread. We do not only have the more commonly observed ones of taxation, trade practices and corporations and securities regulation; we have also extended into other fields, such as health. I have in mind, in particular, two pieces of legislation relating to the Health Insurance Commission, conferring coercive powers on that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In past times, the Attorney-General's Department has largely been the guardian of civil rights in the preparation of governmental measures. In recent times, we have seen new bodies created that have specialist responsibilities in relation to human rights. We have a Privacy Commissioner, a Sex Discrimination Commissioner, an Administrative Review Council and, even within the parliament, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. All of them have some role, albeit minor, in the preparation and enactment of legislation. It would be a sad day indeed if the Attorney-General's Department, because of the special roles of these other bodies, abdicated its role as the principal guardian of human rights in the preparation of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was quite alarming to see the legislation that emanated from the Department of Human Services and Health relating to the Health Insurance Commission. I would be extremely disappointed if I ever thought that had been vetted and approved by the Attorney-General's Department before being submitted to cabinet. There needs to be a better, more widespread approach to the development of coercive powers of government and the spread of intrusions. The time is right and the opportunity is there for that to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a partial response to horrific and disgraceful conduct in former Yugoslavia. For all we know, this conduct may be continuing. I hope and trust that this legislation, and legislation like it in other countries party to the United Nations Security Council resolution, will be used where necessary to bring to account&mdash;whatever their race&mdash;people involved in genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass rapes, murders and the other crimes that have been committed in former Yugoslavia. I hope that the international cooperation involved in the setting up and operation of the international tribunal will convey the message widely that anybody who commits such heinous acts will be condemned by the international community and punished appropriately. </PARA>

It will do much to ensure that the administration of justice on this particular subject is profitable and efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has had a long genesis. At the time of the former Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Bowen, there was great debate in the Australian community and in the House of Representatives on what action would be taken by the Australian parliament to bring those people who had committed war crimes, particularly during the Second World War, to justice. As a result of those discussions, the Australian government of the day took strong action by passing legislation to ensure that those war criminals who had been identified could be pursued and, if possible, arrested, charged and brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of effort was employed and cost incurred by the Australian government in the pursuit of those war criminals and in bringing them to justice. That, in itself, attracted some criticism in the Australian community. This legislation is a watershed in that it received the support of members on both sides of the House. It was also referred to a parliamentary standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Tangney mentioned that the amendments are all in response to the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. He referred to the fact that the government has agreed to accept all but two of the committee's recommendations and part of one recommendation. This bill will bring credit to the efforts of the Australian parliament and the Australian people and will ensure that justice is done in this area. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We were required to do an advisory report on the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill 1994. Whilst I was not a member of the subcommittee that did the detailed examination, I came into the latter stages of the committee's consideration. I am pleased that that committee, in examining the legislation passed to it by this parliament, was able to make some recommendations that were sensible, constructive and, as honourable members commented in the House today, acceptable and conducive to the improvement of the legislation and the way in which the Australian government and the Australian people respond to an international tribunal in which we are participating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The processes that the United Nations will adopt in establishing a tribunal at which war criminals will be brought to trial have been described. The world community has agreed that, more or less, mirror legislation will be passed by contributing nations. Should war criminals or suspects be brought before the tribunal, those countries will be asked to supply distinguished judges to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that has exercised my mind is whether there has been an automatic surrender of Australian sovereignty in this process and whether by some international agreement we cease to have control over people who may be residents or citizens of this country. When examining the government's proposed legislation, the House of Representative Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was careful to look at whether there would be a loss of sovereignty and a loss of control by the government over its own citizens. The committee has come forward with recommendations that will strengthen the legislation and ensure that there is no loss of sovereignty for Australia and that criminals will be dealt with within a system that recognises the unique and open legal system that we have in Australia, which is one of the fairest systems in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the proposal of the government or the opposition to hand over a citizen to an international tribunal that will then, under terms and conditions outside the control of the Australian government and the Australian people, make a decision whether or not that person is a war criminal. It is a recommendation of the committee that a number of amendments be made to this legislation to ensure that Australian citizens are not picked up in the way the government was proposing for the war crime trials, which came to an inglorious stop because no-one could be found to fulfil the requirements laid down in previous war crimes trials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the House will be aware that $12 million was spent looking for World War II war criminals in Australia. Basically, that search proved to be unsuccessful. Even if people under strong suspicion were found, it was almost impossible to bring a conviction because they had to draw on evidence which was 40 or 50 years old and came from countries outside Australia. They had to try to get witnesses to appear in Australia and positively identify the people whom they claimed were the perpetrators of those war crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a different matter. The International War Crimes Tribunal Bill is an international attempt to prevent war crimes continuing without the criminals being brought to book. The UN is looking at the events in the former Yugoslavia to see whether or not people who have perpetrated war crimes can be identified and how they are dealt with. The tribunal's intentions are patently clear and it is obviously up to each country to interpret the extent of the obligations and their domestic implementation. The committee took the comments of the tribunal seriously in that regard. The Acting Deputy Prosecutor of the tribunal, Mr Blewitt, made the point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst all States are under a strict obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal and to comply with its requests and orders, it is nevertheless a question for each State to enact implementing legislation designed to bring their municipal legal system in line with requirements of the Statute. It is a matter for States to comply without undue delay with any request for assistance from the Tribunal and the Tribunal will not seek to interfere with the way in which this occurs.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very clear that the International War Crimes Tribunal is saying that it is not in a position to dominate domestic law in the same way that countries handle suspected criminals within their countries. The committee felt that the Attorney-General's Department had been too willing to forgo Australian sovereignty. We ask the government to build in the checks and balances that the House is now debating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We felt there was a need for magistrates not just to take the word of a policeman or an investigator that an individual standing before them is in fact the war criminal identified by the tribunal. We believe that magistrates must in their own minds establish beyond any doubt that the individual before them is the person desired to be called before the international tribunal. We have placed a responsibility on magistrates and the courts to establish beyond doubt that that individual is the one so identified by the international tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have the situation where an international police group comes in with an identikit of somebody it wants to cart off to an international tribunal, pulls that person into a court and says, `We have found the person,' and the magistrate automatically signs the document because the police have said that that is the person they are seeking. Australia must consciously forgo its hold on that citizen, its protection of that citizen and the sustenance of that citizen. Recommendation 4 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that clause 8 be redrafted to indicate that requests from the Tribunal must be in writing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It is not good enough if a telephone message from an international group in Geneva or elsewhere&mdash;and I know that my colleague at the table, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) understands this&mdash;is received which says, `You Australians need to comply with some on high directive from an international tribunal.' That is just not on. The committee has stated that all requests need to be in writing. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and be sufficient to identify for the accused and the Australian courts the person or persons to be charged, the nature of the charge and the intended time and place of the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>That all needs to be up front and in writing. It is the committee's wish to retain our identity, our sovereignty over our citizens and our obligation to our residents. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommended that clause 9 be redrafted to clarify that the Attorney-General is obliged to issue a notice stating that a request has been received from the Tribunal only if the request complies with the requirements in proposed amended clause 8.</PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney-General has to look over the matters and say, `We have received a valid request from the International War Crimes Tribunal.' That is the proper role and function for the Attorney-General of Australia to play if there is an international request for somebody to face a hearing. The extradition processes are somewhat different from what we have seen before. By the same token, the committee believes that the Australian government stands between its citizens and international tribunals of any sort. The third recommendation to come to my attention is recommendation 7, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that subclause 12(2) be amended to require a magistrate to be satisfied that the person before him or her is the person named in the arrest warrant (issued pursuant to clause 10) prior to remanding that person.</PARA>
<PARA>I have dealt with that issue. It is a pivotal issue that the magistrate be certain that that is the person identified by the tribunal and that is the person to face the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been going through these recommendations in some detail simply because I believe the House needs to understand that it was not the intention of Attorney-General's Department, nor the government to have such a strong role for the Australian people in protecting citizens or residents. It appeared to the committee, which comprises members of all parties, that the government and the Attorney-General's Department were prepared to stand back and adopt a hands-off attitude to any request from the International War Crimes Tribunal. I believe that this committee has served this House well in ensuring that we do not forgo the protection that Australian citizens have learnt to expect from their legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good belonging to a United Nations group which has made laws to override Australian laws and the natural protection of justice that Australian citizens enjoy. This is one of the strengths of our nation. The freedoms that Australians enjoy are precious, and we are not going to have those freedoms submitted to any international tribunal to decide whether somebody should be whipped out of Australia and shoved before a tribunal for a war crime or anything else. Let the proper processes take place, and let they be Australian processes. Recommendation 10 of the committee's report, which further emphasises the point that I am making, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that a provision be inserted into the Bill requiring an additional step between the initial remanding of a person and the Attorney-General's surrender decision.</PARA>
<PARA>After a person has been remanded and is sitting in the cooler or somewhere&mdash;the certificate has come through in writing in the proper form; the Attorney-General has said that it is in the proper form; the magistrate has had the person brought before him or her and agreed on a positive identification&mdash;we go one step further. We require that a person to be brought before a magistrate is eligible for surrender. Recommendation 10 further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria should be that the magistrate is satisfied that the person is the person named in the Tribunal warrant, and that the alleged offence for which surrender is sought falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a final test. The magistrate must be satisfied not only that the person is the one identified by the tribunal but also that the person named in the warrant is standing before him or her and that the alleged offences listed on the warrant fall within the jurisdiction of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough for the tribunal to consider that it has the right person before it and that he or she is in Australia but be a bit fuzzy on whether some of the crimes are war crimes. It must be precise. The magistrate, protecting Australia's interests and the interests of its citizens, must be sure that the demands of the tribunal for these particular acts are within the scope of the tribunal making that request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are asking the Australian legal system at every step to double-check what an international tribunal has previously asked. We are bringing in the Attorney-General to make sure that the original request was sound. We are providing a barrier to the automatic take-out of an Australian that may have committed a war crime. We do not know whether that is the case. A person might fit the description and sound right, but we do not know whether or not that person has committed an offence. This barrier must be put in place to prevent any miscarriage of justice and to ensure that our residents receive from the international community the sorts of conditions and the sort of predictability of Australian law which they are used to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken somewhat more at length, partly by request, than I needed to make the points that I wanted to make, but they are important points. I believe this is a classic role of an Australian parliamentary committee assisting government and the process of the parliament by strengthening important areas&mdash;areas that need to be strengthened&mdash;to ensure the sovereignty of an Australian citizen is maintained above any international body. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Departure Tax Amendment Bill 1994, together with the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994, implements the government's decision announced in the 1994 budget to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitor visas. The cost of these services has been calculated as being $27 per departing passenger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to achieving cost recovery for these services, it was also the government's desire that there be a more effective way of collecting the charge. The old system under departure tax involved purchasing a tax stamp, affixing that to the ticket and then having the stamp cancelled by a customs officer as the person passed through customs on the way out of the country. This process added to the red tape that passengers had to go through at what is often a stressful time anyway. The government is committed to achieving further improvements to Australia's already efficient passenger processing procedures and the report of the review of the Australian Customs Service&mdash;the Conroy report&mdash;gave strong endorsement to the Customs Service's direction in this respect. The removal of the process I have just mentioned is a step towards realisation of the vision for airports of the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why the government also decided to seek the agreement of the airlines to collect the passenger movement charge. While the government is aware that it is common practice around the world for airlines to be required by governments to collect taxes, fees and charges&mdash;70 per cent of countries world wide have airlines collecting some sort of charge&mdash;the government chose rather to work with the airlines, in recognition of the importance of the travel and tourism industry to this country. The government also gave the airlines a commitment to meet reasonable costs of establishing and running the system. Those discussions are under way at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost recovery initiative is proposed to be achieved by utilising the existing legislative mechanism for departure tax to both levy and collect the passenger movement charge. This bill imposes the passenger movement charge whilst the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill 1994 outlines the mechanism for the collection of the charge pending resolution of negotiations with airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The replacement of the existing $25 departure tax with the $27 passenger movement charge will result in the following increases to revenue: in 1994-95, $5 million; 1995-96, $12 million; 1996-97, $13 million; and 1997-98, $13 million.

In the future the tax will be picked up by agents. That will be most convenient to you, as a well-known traveller.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose these departure tax bills. However, we will be proposing an amendment in the consideration in detail stage because the proposed introduction date, 1 January 1995, would be right at the height of the travel season. Those in this House&mdash;as I look around I see a number of distinguished travellers&mdash;would be aware of the inconvenience of attempting to change systems on 1 January 1995. The airlines would not thank you and nor would the travelling public. We are advised that the time of the introduction of the summer timetables in October 1995 would be more convenient for the airlines, and there is a minimum amount of travel at that time. </PARA>

You are proposing to keep it there at least in the short term. Perhaps the question of money flow does not matter and the extra $2 could just as conveniently be raised through the existing system until the airlines can properly accommodate new computer programs and the agents can properly attest to the $27 charge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no comment to make additional to the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), in respect of travellers, but I do see them come and go. The purpose of the Departure Tax Amendment Bill, as was pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), is to change the name `departure tax' to the `passenger movement charge' and to increase the rate of the charge from $25 to $27.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the opposition is supporting the Departure Tax Amendment Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill. That is a little different from the situation that existed when members of the opposition made some comments on 10 May when the changes in the nature of the charge, the title of the charge and the amount of the charge were announced in the budget. The shifting of the mechanism for collection of the charge from the passenger to some form of incorporation in airline tickets will smooth entry and exit from Australia. It will get rid of a considerable irritation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the departure tax was originally introduced by the Fraser government, from time to time we have sought through various means to ease the task it involved. There have been changes in the direction in which that money has been used. Naturally, the gnomes of the Treasury and the Department of Finance abhor dedication or earmarking of particular types of revenue for particular purposes, as was put by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) when he headed up the tourism committee in the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The collection of the departure tax has, from time to time, been raised as something that we ought to try to ease. It has been a considerable obstruction to passengers on arrival and departure. It is worth looking at the method of collection of the charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 10 of the Departure Tax Collection Act 1978 empowers the minister to make arrangements with a person for the collection of the charge. It is to this end that negotiations are taking place with international airlines for collection arrangements. Ideally&mdash;I hope this arrangement can be reached fairly soon&mdash;the charge would be incorporated in the airline ticket price with a separate entry on the ticket identifying the nature and the amount of the charge. The collection of the charge in that way will make it much more convenient for travellers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of the existing system has almost doubled in percentage terms compared with that of other systems around the world. The existing cost of departure tax collection is something like four to five per cent of revenue collected, compared with about two per cent in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measure in these bills which goes to collection of this charge will be required for some 11 million people who will be moving in and out of Australia in the year ahead. This measure will increase net revenue to Australia. It will provide sufficient revenue to meet the costs of immigration services, quarantine services and customs services provided to people entering and departing from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airlines have agreed in principle to these arrangements. The government has indicated to the airlines that it will meet the airlines' establishment and running costs of the necessary systems. The only thing about which there is some dispute within this place and with some of the airlines is the date of commencement of the new set of arrangements. I will come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 70 per cent of countries include some form of departure charge through the sale of tickets. This new system will bring us into line with most other countries in the world&mdash;some 78 of them. Of the 35 countries that have air links with Australia, some 24 have some form of collection of a government fee or charge at the point of the ticket sale. So we are not doing something different; we are coming into line with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1981, the honourable member for Fadden was very critical of the cages at the airports collecting money. He said the sensible thing to do was to incorporate that charge into the point of ticket sale or to incorporate it within the ticket itself. After all this time, that approach is going to take effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by the honourable member for Ryan, the objection of the airlines is that the 1 January date poses too many difficulties; the tickets will have been printed. It has been suggested that the commencement date should be October next year. I understand that the opposition is putting forward an amendment to that effect. It would seem to be a sensible approach for agreement to be reached with the airlines as quickly as possible. The government has indicated its flexibility about this commencing date. We may well reach agreement with quite a number of the airlines which ought to be able to move to the new system at some considerable time before October 1995. We would like to see that developed. Personally, I cannot see why we need to have an amendment that locks the commencement date into October 1995. There are other ways to deal with that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition reacted to the budget announcements on 10 May by saying that the government had slugged the tourism industry with $140 million by increasing departure tax. The implication in that statement was that an additional charge of $140 million was imposed on the industry. That was not the case, as has been set out in the notes in respect of these bills. The increase of $2 in the overall charge will add $5 million to revenue in 1994-95 and&mdash;as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology said&mdash;in the three succeeding years revenue will increase by $12 million, $13 million and $13 million respectively. The claim that the $140 million is a slug to the industry is without foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount which is being collected now is rightly being collected in respect of the provision of customs, quarantine and immigration services. One rider I would add is that&mdash;I believe I speak for both sides of the House on this&mdash;those services should be provided on an efficient basis, in an effective manner and in a cost-efficient way. It should not simply become a matter of the charges being edged up each time there is pressure for an increase in costs. There has to be a discipline to ensure that those charges are justified and that we are doing it as well as we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures for traffic coming in and out of Australia show that in 1992-93 Qantas carried 39 1/2 per cent of international traffic into and out of Australia. In the same year, there were 9.8 million passenger movements to and from Australia. In 1993-94, the total was 11.3 million. There were 5.8 million arrivals, slightly more than the number of departures&mdash;5.56 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot is being said about the growth rate of the airline market in the Pacific&mdash;it is the fastest growing market in the world. Asia currently accounts for some 30 per cent of world air travel. Its annual growth rate averaged between 11 and 12 per cent in the 1970s and the 1980s. That growth rate has fallen below 10 per cent, due mainly to the slump in Japan&mdash;which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of all international air traffic in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecast passenger growth for this decade in the Asia-Pacific region is eight per cent annually, compared with a figure of five per cent annually worldwide. That reinforces my opening point that the Asia-Pacific region is the fastest growing airline market in the world, but it is not growing as fast as it has grown in the past. Also, as the base gets larger and larger it is more difficult to maintain the same high growth rates of earlier years. As the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) said on 24 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the emerging Asian market has led the way. Arrivals from Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore all doubled compared with February 1993 while the Taiwan and Korean markets increased by over 60 per cent . . . arrivals from Japan, our single largest market, grew by over 13 per cent to 65,800.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister was comparing February 1993 with February 1994. This growth reflects the enduring features of Australia as a safe, friendly and unique international tourist destination. One can say that credit is due to the Tourist Commission, but credit is due also to everybody associated with the international travel industry&mdash;everybody in Australia that is providing a service of quality so that people visit Australia and go back and talk about Australia as a desirable and enjoyable place to visit. As Australians, we have a responsibility to ensure that the product we are providing is competitive and that the quality is consistent. We all have a contribution to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the opposition supports this legislation, it should have a speedy passage through the House. This legislation will enable us to further improve and to smooth the arrival and departure of overseas visitors and the arrival and departure of Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for giving me a few free plugs for the long campaign to get rid of the cages. In that respect, I am pleased to speak on the Departure Tax Amendment Bill and the Departure Tax Collection Amendment Bill. I acknowledge that something that should never have happened in the first place is finally going to go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its origin goes back to October 1978. The final report of the House of Representatives Select Committee on Tourism, which was headed by me and the late Hon. Frank Stewart, recommended that Australia introduce a departure tax which should be used to promote tourism. But there was a rider in that recommendation that it should be collected by the airlines. The airlines decided that it was all a bit too hard. We went under the cage regime, which we have been stuck with ever since. That is just one aspect of this legislation that the opposition certainly will not oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the proposed amendment of the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). As I understand it, one of the difficulties that the airlines have is that pre-sold tickets which are already out in circulation at the moment will be caught by this legislation. I understand that Qantas has 130,000 tickets in circulation. When the holders of those tickets physically go to an airport, there could be some misunderstanding. We are trying to make the path quite smooth for the government to try to overcome this difficulty. If Qantas has 130,000 tickets in circulation, you can bet that the other airlines probably have an equal number or even more. The prospect is that a quarter of a million tickets could be floating around Australia which will be caught by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, Qantas will have to do one of two things for tickets to be used after 1 January. It could recall those 130,000 tickets, make an additional charge and reissue them or, as the opposition proposes, it could maintain the status quo with the cages until October next year, which will not result in any real loss of revenue for the government, and require people to pay the $27 as part of the additional departure tax. This amendment is designed to be of some use to the travelling public. It seeks to stop some of that inconvenience and overcome any difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason the airlines cannot put this into place virtually tomorrow. The computerised reservation systems that now exist around the world are so sophisticated that it is merely a matter of putting in a program to allow for an additional $27. One of the things that I like about this legislation and the way that the CRSs, the computer reservation systems, work is simply that it will be quite up-front about the amount of money required to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that this bill seeks to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement fee. The reality is that, when those tickets are issued, there is a nice little box at the bottom which says `Tax'. People will know that they are paying that $27. Australia already has a number of airports that are charging their own passenger handling fees. Cairns airport is an example of that. It is a privately operated airport which imposes its own passenger tax. That has appeared on domestic airline tickets, through the computer reservation systems, for many years now. So, in a technical sense, there is no real difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), I was interested to hear his projection that this will ultimately bring in $13 million per year. I was even more interested to hear some of the projections of the honourable member for Shortland. While not criticising them at all, I think the estimates of revenue are very much under what they will be. I believe that the estimate of the growth of international passenger traffic in and out of Australia is very much under what it will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been criticised in the past for estimating that by the turn of this century Australia has the prospect of 10 million international visitors coming here. It is interesting that the growth forecasts are being ratcheted up all the time. The Australian Tourist Commission is now acknowledging that we will have 7.9 million to eight million visitors by the end of this decade. According to some of the projections and the figures, my feeling is that that figure of 10 million will certainly be reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most authoritative organisations on economic estimates is undoubtedly the Boeing Corporation, which is a commercial aircraft company. Boeing put out a series of studies on its projected growth figures in tourism and passenger traffic generally. Obviously, that is part of selling aircraft, but these figures have been coming out for more than a decade now. It is quite interesting that its projections for Australia and the Pacific generally have been proven to be very conservative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was at Boeing in July, I received a copy of its latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Market Outlook</EMPHASIS>. What the honourable member for Shortland was talking about is quite true. There has been a flattening in the Asian travel market mainly because of the Japanese situation in the Asian market. In this report, the section on the estimate of the major air travel markets from 1994 to 2013 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The largest addition to increased air travel will come from travel within the Asia Pacific region. Combining the Intra Asia Pacific, Trans Pacific, and Asia-Europe travel markets indicates that 40% of future growth will come from travel to, from and within this region . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It gives the following breakdowns: intra-Asia Pacific, 23.5 per cent; North America, 22.7 per cent; and the trans-Pacific, 13.3 per cent. Those figures are quite interesting when lined up with some of the other growth areas. The North Atlantic is only 9.8 per cent; intra-Europe is only 11.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the forecasts for the annual growth rate of these markets. According to Boeing, the intra-Asia Pacific is looking at an annual growth rate of 6.8 per cent each year for the next 20 years. The trans-Pacific market is looking at a rate of 6.8 per cent for the next 20 years. They are at the top of the chart. While that includes all of Asia, the challenge to Australia will be to get our fair share of that market. There is some argument within the industry and the government generally as to just how much of this traffic we want. There will be pressure on Australia to develop its infrastructure and have the capacity to accept more of these people whether we like it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are reaching a stage that is very critical for the Australian tourist industry. Within the next couple of years, we need to decide whether we will be a major player in this market. If we just sit back with what we have at the moment, we will enjoy some of the fruits of international tourism. But the pressures on us to be able to provide more destinations and more infrastructure will be absolutely enormous. In all fairness, we will have to accommodate a lot of that growth not only for our own export incomes but also for the jobs that will be created by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the pressures that are now starting to arise. My colleague from Townsville, the parliamentary secretary, is at the table. He and I have spoken about the development of North Queensland tourism quite often. While Townsville probably does not get the sort of figures that Cairns does, I am sure that he will be interested, because there are huge flow-on effects from the traffic that comes into Cairns and makes its way down to Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the authoritative forecasters in Queensland is Morgans, the stockbroking people. Michael Knox, who issues a newsletter every quarter, has come up with some quite interesting figures about what has happened with Queensland tourism through this year and what is likely to happen in the next year. We are finding that in a place like Cairns we have a desperate shortage of accommodation at the moment. Townsville also has a desperate shortage of accommodation. On the Gold Coast, which is looking after international traffic, we are already starting to see a shortage of hotels. While in a place like Cairns there are about three new hotels on the books, the reality is that Cairns and the Gold Coast now need about five. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this breakdown that Morgans have given, it is quite fascinating to see that the growth rate for Queensland tourism to the end of this calendar year will be about 10.7 per cent. There are some staggering figures. It does not really matter where you look at the major markets in Queensland. In Brisbane, for example, this is regarded as a bit of a low season for the tourism industry. The figures on international visitors and other visitors into Brisbane this year will be about 10.3 per cent greater in the September quarter than for the same period of Expo. The peak of Expo 88 was the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures point out that the growth in Cairns during this year is just absolutely phenomenal. Guest nights have risen from 1.8 million per quarter in the first quarter of 1982 to a massive 4.36 million in the December quarter of 1993. Those figures are for all over the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the physical demand on hotel bed nights in Queensland at the moment. It is really quite incredible to think that, overall, the state has an occupancy rate of 75.7 per cent. That is a huge figure. In the hotel industry, once you start hitting about a 75 per cent to 80 per cent occupancy rate, your hotel is full and you start expanding into another property. As I say, that growth is going to happen whether we like it or not. We have to make sure that at all levels of government we have the capacity to be able to provide the infrastructure to meet those demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that infrastructure is obviously airports. That is why the ALP conference next week will be so terribly important when the privatisation issue comes up. Quite frankly, I do not think governments have the financial capacity at the moment to be able to provide the airport infrastructure that will be required. There is no doubt that we will have to develop Badgerys Creek. It should have been done years ago. It is a major investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what is happening in Brisbane at the moment. It has one of the fastest airport growth rates in the world. We have an international terminal that is virtually finished but which will not come on line until the end of 1995. The reality is that the Federal Airports Corporation does not have enough money to finish the job on time. That is not its fault. It is the nature and structure of the beast and the fact that the FAC does not have access to finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot more work will have to be done in Sydney. We have seen the work that is going on at Melbourne airport. All these things are putting some tremendous demands on the public purse. The public purse cannot provide them, but they must be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation option is the only real option that we have. In the whole business of airports, all that necessary infrastructure, such as immigration and customs, has to be provided. It is an expensive business. Obviously, this piece of legislation will help to provide some of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments at all levels should be making some very hard decisions on just how they are going to meet this major demand of international visitors over the rest of this decade and beyond. There will be tremendous pressure on airports and enormous pressure on roads and on local governments to provide services like water supplies and sewerage. Quite frankly, what worries me is that a lot of these decisions are not being considered. Those decisions will have to be made if we are going to meet that demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the figure I have often quoted is about to be updated. The projections of the world tourism organisation at the moment show that 140 million Asians will be travelling offshore for their annual holidays by the year 2000. Quite frankly, if we got one per cent of them at the moment, we would find it very difficult to provide the infrastructure for them. Australia will be in demand. It is a great destination. We will not let it go, and the world will not allow us to let it go. We have to make those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the debate tonight, the honourable member for Shortland made reference to a press release that was issued after the budget and the particular announcement about the $140 million that is coming off it. It is true that our passenger service charges are not the highest in the world. Quite obviously, there are airports around the place that have much higher charges than we do. People who travel in and out of Heathrow are paying about twice as much as they are paying in Australia. The passenger service component of the new airport of Kansai in Japan will be very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also stress that, while we make these adjustments, we have to realise that the tourist industry can be a bit fragile and that it is very competitive. While those demands will be there, we must make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the market. It is a fine balance, and it can be so on a year to year basis. One particular market&mdash;such as Japan&mdash;can decide to reduce its rates. In order to get them in, we have to make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will allow this legislation to pass. I sincerely hope that the government looks at the amendment that we propose tonight purely for its convenience. It will not deprive the government of income, but it could provide the airlines with a bit of a safety valve in terms of those tickets that have already been issued. While I hate the thought of having the cages around from the beginning of January next year until the end of October, in terms of the smooth transition of this arrangement, it will help very much indeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning in the debate on the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 I pointed out the injustice of the pro rata collection of HECS for first-time graduates in the work force. Tonight I wish to highlight yet another HECS anomaly which is similar to the pro rata payment system and is another example of a petty money grab. For want of a better description, I call it the HECS double take, because it arises out of a situation where people, in clearing their HECS debt, are effectively hit twice with a bill from the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, under the new PAYE system, people pay additional tax instalments to cover their anticipated HECS debt for the following year. But when that debt is reduced to zero the Taxation Office fails to openly advise people to stop paying their tax credits. The result is that people pay off their final HECS partially twice, and those tax credits are not attributed until the following tax year. Let me cite an outrageous case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kevin Turner, a policeman at Bargara near Bundaberg, in the second half of 1992 completed a full-time six-month advanced certificate in policing at Griffith University in Brisbane. He accumulated a total HECS debt of $1,146. In 1992-93, he earned less than the yearly threshold, so his HECS was held over. In 1993-94, his taxable income was $33,127, or $637 per week, so under the HECS guidelines he was required to pay four per cent of his income&mdash;$1,352 per annum, or $25.48 per week&mdash;towards his HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94, he would clear his entire HECS debt of $1,146. However, in May this year Mr Turner, like other HECS clients, received a letter from Mr Michael Carmody, the head of the tax office, urging him to lodge a compulsory&mdash;I stress, compulsory&mdash;employment declaration form or face tax being deducted at the marginal rate of 48.4 per cent. Mr Turner obediently did so, advising his employer that he had an accumulated HECS debt and enabling the additional tax instalments of $25.48 per week to be deducted from his pay from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when Mr Turner went to lodge his 1993-94 tax return in September this year, he discovered that the tax office had hit him with the entire HECS debt of $1,146, but he received no credit for the additional tax instalments totalling some $300 which he paid between July and September. Imagine if Mr Turner had not lodged his tax return with his tax agent until the latest possible date, which is April 1995. By that stage, Mr Turner would have paid an additional $1,000 in tax instalments in the belief he was paying off his 1994 HECS debt&mdash;a classic double take!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People like Mr Turner who have been caught out have since been able to lodge a section 221D&mdash;an application for variation of tax instalment deductions form&mdash;which stops their employer from taking out further tax instalments. However, this often comes too late, with the likes of Mr Turner paying some $300&mdash;it could have been $1,000 in the worst case scenario&mdash;in tax credits before realising this HECS double take which, I stress, will not be rectified until the following tax year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Mr Turner's is not an isolated case. I believe that many thousands of ex-students could be affected&mdash;people who are most often struggling with mortgages and people who are educating young families. The solution is that people who believe they will clear their HECS debt in a given year should be advised by the tax office not to sign the employment declaration form or to get a special 221D exemption form, so that the additional tax instalments are not unnecessarily taken out in the following year. It does not require a major policy change but some better and more honest advice from the tax office. It is important that people pay tax only once. I believe that those who have unfairly had their tax collected twice should receive immediate refunds. They should not have to wait until the end of the financial year for refunds. </PARA>

As part of the media coverage, on Friday, 9 September&mdash;less than four days after John's murder&mdash;Channel 9's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> began a heavy local advertising campaign claiming Richard Carleton would be conducting a tribute to John Newman at the Cabramatta Cabra-Vale Ex-Active Servicemen's Club.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Cabramatta is part of my electorate, I decided to attend. I must say that I had reservations about the forum from very early on, but I hoped to be proved wrong. I had a feeling it would simply be an Asian bashing, ratings grabbing exercise. I went along to the meeting with high hopes but low expectations. Unfortunately, my expectations were proved correct. From the outset, Mr Carleton belittled the police and  their efforts to solve the crime. From his comments and tone, Mr Carleton clearly had preconceived ideas of who was responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, Richard did not stop there. He pushed on, also claiming that the Asian wall of silence was preventing the police from getting the truth. Again, it was clear that Richard had made up his mind as to which group was responsible&mdash;the Asian community, of course. In the midst of all the tub-thumping, there were a few voices of reason. I would like to think that mine was one of the voices, together with those of one of my parliamentary colleagues, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), and the representatives of the police force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the most articulate voice was clearly that of a young high school student from the local area. That young woman spoke more wisdom in a few brief sentences than a year of Richard Carleton plus his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minute</EMPHASIS> programs. Her thoughts, and those of a number of other young members of the community, made me proud to be their local member. Sure, we have problems locally&mdash;perhaps more than our fair share&mdash;but seeing those young people shows that multiculturalism is certainly not one of those problems, in spite of the media treatment we get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disregarding those positive points, Mr John Westacott, executive producer of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS>, this week sent a letter to one of my local newspapers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Liverpool City Champion</EMPHASIS>. In it, he attacks me and my attitude towards the forum. While the content of Mr Westacott's letter may well be defamatory, let me say this: if I had not known better, I would have thought that he was describing his own program. Unfortunately, it appeared that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">60 Minutes</EMPHASIS> was keen to give only yobbos and bigots a forum to increase racial tension&mdash;a great formula for increasing ratings but nothing more. </PARA>

I know and understand the problems of my local area better than some jumped-up journo from Hunters Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Westacott suggests that I pick up from where John Newman left off, but I have no intention of doing that. Let me simply say that John and I had different ideas about how to achieve for our constituents. Mr Westacott should realise that there is more than one way to achieve for your community, and that the different levels of government have different responsibilities. Of course, I realise that this is a lot to comprehend when you are blindly chasing ratings. Mr Westacott claims to have received many expressions of gratitude following his program. Mr Speaker, let me inform you that my office was inundated with positive feedback to my comments, not to mention the numerous suggestions as to what Richard Carleton should do that were both physically and anatomically&mdash;not to mention morally&mdash;impossible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed privatisation of the NRMA is a hijack of over $2 billion of members' funds. It exceeds anything attempted by the entrepreneurs of the 1980s. If it succeeds, it will be the beginning of a massive de-mutualisation of such bodies as AMP, National Mutual, Colonial Mutual and other state motoring organisations. It will herald the change in Australia from a cooperative society to one clearly based on individual greed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is widespread alarm in New South Wales about the behaviour of the controlling directors and the executive of the NRMA. This alarm relates to the public promotion of the sale by the executive officers who have not declared their financial interests, the misleading advertising contrary to the Trade Practices Act, the removal of the secret ballot for members, the effective intimidation of NRMA staff, interest free loans of members' money to staff, the failure of the Australian Securities Commission in relation to the prospectus, the role of the NRMA vice-president and Australian Securities Commission deputy chair, Lyn Ralph, and the failure of the NRMA to allow a no case to be put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies carried out by financial experts show that the NRMA proposal is convoluted and obscure, and that it certainly breaches the Corporations Law and the Trade Practices Act. It is misleading and deceptive. Analysis shows a hidden loss to NRMA members of $2,220 million, without counting increases in road services costs and potential losses to aged pensioners, sole parents, family allowances, Austudy, home child-care allowances, family allowances, family allowance supplements and pensioner card holders. An amount of $93.5 million of members' insurance rebates will disappear and members will bear the $30 million flotation costs. The maintenance of a share register alone will cost $5 million annually. It is suggested that members will receive up to $2,000 for their shares, yet the truth is that no price is fixed and the NRMA board does not even have to sell shares at the best price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real possibility that the share price will stagnate in a glutted market. Taxation treatment is still vague, but it is certain that the Treasury will benefit to the extent of $600 million to $700 million. All of this is hidden in the board's proposal, which pretends that the shares are free when in fact they are simply an exchange for the member's vote and assets. No additional funds are created but significant changeover costs to members are incurred. The board's prospectus talks of a favourable outcome for tax, yet the NRMA will lose its mutual exemption status, assets will attract around $50 million in capital gains tax, and $375 million of tax credits on future dividends will be lost, as well as attracting capital gains tax on the free shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several potentially adverse consequences for members in receipt of social security, veterans' affairs and Austudy payments. Shares, unlike current memberships, will become income and assets tested. With an additional $2,000 income, age and veterans' affairs pensioners could lose up to $38 per fortnight. Members close to assets test cut-offs could lose the whole of their family payments or Austudy. The home child-</PARA>
<PARA>care allowance is income tested and a franked dividend of $70, that is 1,000 shares, could halve the $30 weekly allowance, and franking credit is of no value to an allowance recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absence of a no case and the failure to spell out the potentially adverse tax and social security impacts in the prospectus appear to be inconsistent with fiduciary duty. The use of terms such as `free shares' and `favourable tax treatment' in the prospectus is misleading and deceptive and a breach of the Trade Practices Act. The validity of special resolutions terminating the membership of members and the role of NRMA Holdings as a member of the association are highly questionable. These problems and many others have been confirmed in a legal opinion by John Gamsey QC and Brian Camilleri, prepared for the minority directors of the NRMA&mdash;Jane Singleton, Dawn Fraser and Richard Talbot. The legal opinion confirms the defective and misleading nature of the prospectus and that the directors of NRMA Insurance have not adequately discharged their duties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The farm drought measures released and announced today by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) certainly will provide great relief to drought-stricken farmers throughout the country areas of Australia. I welcome those measures. I have been pleased to work with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Bob Collins, and to visit areas with him and recently to visit some of the western areas of Queensland with the Prime Minister. The development of the policy is in part a result of those visits and the local knowledge gained. It will help those farmers affected by drought to hold onto their farms and to maintain a reasonable quality of life until the drought breaks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy changes announced today recognise that the  drought we are currently facing is a severe and exceptional one and something which farmers could not have planned. I also welcome the endorsement of the policy announced today by the National Farmers Federation. The government has worked closely with the National Farmers Federation to develop a scheme which will provide immediate assistance where it is needed. It is a basic policy change but does continue the integrity of the general policy. It will provide help where it is needed when it is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly commend the members of the National Farmers Federation for the constructive role they have played. I note that the National Farmers Federation says that the states will also have a crucial role to play in this and that it will be monitoring the effort of the states. The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Don McGauchie, said that the extra measures were significant and that they would be of enormous benefit to farm families who have been suffering severe drought. `Today's announcements are consistent with advice given to the department from farm organisations,' he said. He also said that the Prime Minister's personal visit to severely droughted areas in Queensland last week clearly had influenced the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr McGauchie said that Senator Collins, backed by the Prime Minister, had done a good job for the farm sector and that both of them have `our sincere thanks'. He said that it is now up to the states to also meet their responsibilities for funding in this area and undertook that the National Farmers Federation and the member bodies will continue to work closely with the government to develop final proposals in all the areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new relief payment will provide farm families with  sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments under the drought relief package will be made available to farm families in areas assessed to be in exceptional drought and will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to the jobsearch allowance. Farm assets will not be subject to assessment for drought relief payment. Payments under the drought relief payment will be available from mid-October, but they will be retrospective to the start of the month, which is only a couple of weeks away now. They will continue until six months after the exceptional circumstances conditions are terminated. Those families will also be eligible for family payments and health care card benefits. Under Austudy, the existing Austudy farm assets test will be removed for those families in exceptional drought areas. There will be farm business support to the measure of $74 million for the RAS over 1994-95 and 1995-96. That will be available to assist farm businesses during drought exceptional circumstances and the recovery period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package also includes measures to help farms recover from drought. There will be a six-month period after the termination of the exceptional circumstances declaration in which applications can be made. Farmers have not been able to access the exceptional circumstance provisions of RAS without first selling off-farm assets. That has created difficulties where farmers have taken steps to provide for their retirement. In recognition of this, investments in bona fide insurance and superannuation funds have been excluded from the assets test for the exceptional circumstances support and an assets test of $163,500 will apply for other off-farm assets. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the maximum individual annual assistance limit on RAS interest payments has been lifted from $50,000 to $100,000, while the cumulative limit over five years on assistance has been lifted from $100,000 to $500,000. There is also additional support for counselling and support services and for drought preparedness. It leaves the National Party and the opposition generally in a very poor position. I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) tonight in speaking about it said&mdash;he was still holding on to it&mdash;that he was disappointed that the coalition's proposed fodder subsidy had not been taken up by the government. Obviously he is not aware of the rorts that went on with that. For example, in Queensland in the 1980s, there was a $15 million subsidy and 76 per cent of those funds were paid to only 16 per cent of program users. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

But for us to be rising at 8 o'clock, I think, is a quite obscene waste of taxpayers' money. I think it is a dereliction of our duty to govern this country. We are away from home. People now go out to dinner, not to the staff caff or to the members dining room. We could fire a cannon through that place now. I think it is a great shame that in what was a great employing institution, the Australian parliament, which was providing jobs for young people in Canberra&mdash;not only young people but also people of all ages&mdash;the work has now diminished and we are getting away from this place at 8 o'clock at night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) for the initiatives announced today in the drought package. The total cost of assistance will be $91.4 million this financial year and $72.8 million next year. The Austudy exemption alone is worth $3.7 million this year and $2.7 million next year. I am sure everyone in this House will welcome that package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of my electorate, which extends from Cairns to the Torres Strait, has been relatively unaffected by the drought that is currently ravaging much of Australia's farming country. However, around Lakeland Downs, the dry season has gone on and on. I have no doubt that the measures in this package concerning changes to RAS will be particularly welcomed in that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas in my electorate that are affected by drought are remote. For example, Lakeland Downs is four to five hours drive from Cairns and two days drive from Brisbane. The graziers and farmers of Lakeland Downs are not in a position to slip into their nearest Social Security office to fill in the relevant forms to access additional drought assistance because the nearest DSS office is 300 kilometres away. While they will no doubt hear about today's very good package on the ABC radio and television, they may have to wait up to a week for the mail plane to bring the daily papers and any written correspondence about this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context I would like to comment on the findings of a rural outreach program conducted by the Mareeba office of the DSS in 1992. I was provided with a copy of the paper by the Mareeba DSS office after I made inquiries about the level of DSS assistance for farmers in my electorate. The internal report on the Mareeba rural outreach program makes some very pertinent observations about the perennial problem that the DSS faces in providing service to rural areas. There are a lot of matters listed. The most important is the difficulty of accessibility of the DSS to remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the outreach modes trialled, the most successful was personal contact by DSS officers at various meetings with farming groups. Eighty-two per cent of claims received during the outreach program were made following contact with DSS officers at meetings. I believe that the findings of this local initiative are worth noting in the context of these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough to come up with the dollars. We must now make sure that all those farmers who are eligible for assistance are made aware of their entitlements. It is not just up to the DSS. Farming organisations have a key role to play. The National Farmers Federation has been full of praise for the government's package today and local farming organisations have regular contact with their members. They are in a position to make sure that their members are aware of the full range of assistance available in this package as well as the normal DSS family payments. I note that the National Farmers Federation has welcomed today's assistance package. It is now up to the NFF to get that good news out to its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most significant recommendations of the report of the Mareeba outreach program was that each DSS office have a rural contact person to help address the perennial problems, one of which I have listed. This person's duties could include contacting local farming groups, attending appropriate meetings, identifying when farmers are in need and mediating between farmers and other DSS staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other problems that were raised are the complex nature of the claims process, time constraints farmers face in the day-to-day farm operation, the difficulty clients have in comprehending the details of available resources, and the diversity of resources available to farmers, which leads to some confusion. I think the whole package is an excellent idea. I will be forwarding a copy of the report on the Mareeba outreach program to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) for his comments so that hopefully some of the good ideas in the report can be taken up by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is to introduce amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, Farm Household Support Act 1992, Fisheries Administration Act 1991, Fisheries Management Act 1991, National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, Wheat Marketing Act 1989, Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993, Wool Tax Act (No.3) 1964 and the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there are several acts that require a minor amendment relating to the change of name of the `Australian Agricultural Council' to the `Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 concern levy payers to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Small winemakers often forward grapes to another, usually larger, winemaker who converts the material into wine under instructions for a fee. This is called toll processing. The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker for him or her to market. The smaller winemaker owns the wine throughout the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the producer and is liable for levy on the wine. This cost is usually added to the fee charged to the smaller winemaker. The smaller winemaker is therefore the effective, but not the official, levy payer and accordingly is not entitled to attend, debate or vote in the industry annual general meeting of the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed will permit small winemakers who toll process to pay levy directly and to accept the rights and obligations of levy payers. By redefining the term `producer' for the purpose of the wine grapes levy under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and replacing the term `winemaker' with `producer' in part IVB of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, which relates to annual general meetings of the industry, small winemakers will become the official levy payers in their own right and will be able to represent their own interests to the corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 are for two main purposes. Firstly, they will ensure that ecologically sustainable development principles are written into the charter of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and that the membership of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation board will include, in future, expertise in environmental and ecological matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation will therefore need to take ecologically sustainable development principles into account in its corporate planning and annual reporting and in determining priorities for allocation of research and development funds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the amendments will provide for the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to allocate funds received from patents or trademarks associated with non-research and development activities to activities other than research and development. The most significant of these non-research and development activities will be the revenue from the commercialisation of the woolmark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992 implement a range of measures to improve the delivery of farm household support to farmers experiencing financial difficulties and to improve the administration of farm household support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers applying for farm household support will have a longer period to provide proof that they are unable to access further commercial finance. If farm household support recipients are dissatisfied with a decision in relation to the extension of their grant periods, they will have improved mechanisms to seek a review of such decisions. This will complement the current mechanism of an appeal direct to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments also allow for improved administration of farm household support by providing a power for the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to delegate his or her powers under the act. To assist with management of the loan portfolio, and to ensure that all eligible recipients receive the benefit of the conversion of nine months of their farm household support payments to a grant, all farm household support recipients will be required to notify the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy of certain changes in their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently no provision in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to prevent a person who has received a lump sum farm household support payment upon the sale of their farm from receiving farm household support at a later stage and again selling a farm and receiving another such payment. These amendments ensure that a person may receive only one such payment. This will ensure that the funds available for this purpose are directed equitably to those who are committed to re-establishing their families outside the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report on the adequacy of fisheries legislation, presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in December 1993, recommended a number of amendments to fisheries legislation. A majority of the recommended changes will improve the operation of the legislation and it is opportune to include the technical amendments in this bill. During the inquiry, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority identified some further technical amendments to improve the effectiveness of the legislation. These have also been included in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technical amendments are proposed to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to clarify the sources of funds available to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Another amendment recognises the amalgamation of the ministerial councils responsible for fisheries and forestry. The amalgamation results from the decision of the Council of Australian Governments to reduce the number of ministerial councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that are proposed to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 will allow fishing permit holders greater flexibility in nominating the boat to be used with their permit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 is amended to eliminate an anomaly in funding arrangements for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The amended provision will ensure that research contributions from state licensed fishermen that are paid directly to the corporation or to consolidated revenue can be matched by the Commonwealth as originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, which were at the request of the cattle industry, will broaden the scope of the survey to encompass animal feeds and fibre products. This will enable industries to have a wider picture of likely contaminants in the food chain and lead to earlier intervention if contaminants are detected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will be supplemented by the national residue survey having the facilities, at industry's instigation, to fund educational and extension programs from the national residue survey's account. This will lead to a more efficient survey and give industry a stronger role in ensuring that its commodity is, indeed, clean and green, and far more competitive on domestic and international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 extends the definition of `grain'. The amendment is necessary following the transfer to the Australian Wheat Board of the seed testing facilities of the Victorian Department of Agriculture. The transfer is beneficial to, and is supported by, the grains and seeds industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new definition of `grain' extends the coverage from the common cereal grains to horticultural, pasture and tree seeds, but only for the purposes of seed testing and seed certification. The Australian Wheat Board will not be able to use its marketing and trading powers for horticultural, pasture and tree seeds as it does not wish to undertake such activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is also being amended to allow for regulations to be made which will make it mandatory, rather than voluntary as at present, for wheat levy payers and collectors to provide certain information concerning the levy payment. The information is used for the management of the wheat industry fund and the allocation to individual levy payers of equity in the fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An administrative amendment to the act will remove the 65-year age limit restriction on persons appointed to the board of the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following amendments included in this bill are of a procedural nature directed to improving the administration of the issues dealt with in those acts. The amendment to the Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993 corrects an error in a date. The amendments to the Wool Tax Act (No.3) 1964 are of a procedural nature and remove all references to `registered' from the title of wool dealers because such a reference is now obsolete. The amendment to the definition of sugar industry organisations contained in the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 is necessary following the consolidation of the sugar industry organisations currently listed within the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council Act 1984, Biological Control Act 1984, Rural Industries Research (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985, Rural Industries Research Act 1985, Pig Industry Act 1986, Horticultural Policy Council Act 1987, Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Council Act 1991 result from the amalgamation of the former ministerial councils that dealt with agriculture, water resources, soil conservation and rural adjustment issues into the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. Of these pre-existing ministerial councils, the Australian Agriculture Council was referred to in these acts. It is necessary, therefore, that these acts be amended. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill is to revise the arrangements for levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979 as amended, `the act'. The government is making these changes at the request of the winemaking industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act imposes a levy on winemakers.

The government provides matching funding for research and development expenditure on a dollar for dollar basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worthwhile noting that to date levy rates have been set and altered at the request of industry. I do not anticipate that this will change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the legislation specifies a complex range of levy rates for the marketing component. This makes for an unwieldy process when changing the levy rates for the marketing component. The bill instead provides that the levy rates will be set out in regulations, as is the usual case for horticultural levies. This will facilitate execution of industry requests to change the levy and bring it into line with normal practice. At the same time a maximum amount&mdash;0.5 per cent of the gross value of production&mdash;is set for the marketing component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act already provides that the levy rates for the research component be specified by regulation. The research levy rate is at present $1.90 per tonne and the legislation sets a limit of $2 per tonne for this levy. The maximum was set in the original act of 1979 and needs to be raised to $3 per tonne to enable the industry to increase its funding of industry research and development, if it so desires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also ends the exemption that smaller winemakers, those processing less than 10 tonnes of product, had from paying levy. As non-payers, those winemakers have no representation in the decisions and operations of the corporation and its regulatory functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that these winemakers will pay the small annual fee that constitutes the minimum levy rate, in return for which they will have the right to represent their interests at annual general meetings of the corporation and to receive the services and information that the corporation provides to its levy payers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will be aware that the corporation's role is of considerable importance in the Australian wine industry's drive to reach an annual export level of $1 billion by the year 2000. Many small producers will not be exporters, but the changes in the domestic market directly affect them. Such changes include the effects of expanded trade on grape supplies and Australia's commitment to end the use of European geographical indications in labelling our wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the small winemakers not be left out of consideration in the strategic development of the Australian wine industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the `producer' and is liable for levy on the wine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is being debated here today in cognate. The other three bills are the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four pieces of legislation cover an amazing array of primary industries. It is perhaps a timely reminder to us all that primary industry in Australia covers a most diverse and dynamic spectrum of products, people and markets. It is most heartening to observe a common theme running through these four bills. It is the strong desire within those who work in and for our primary industries to help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will be moving an amendment to the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), and I will deal with it at the conclusion of my contribution to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the maximum rate of the national residue survey levy to increase from 0.02 per cent per head to 0.06 per cent per head. Almost all primary industries in Australia contribute to a national residue survey in order to ensure the food they produce is free of harmful residues. The survey for each particular industry is now fully funded by the industry itself. It is an industry helping itself by ensuring it contributes to, in this case, the national residue survey. In this case, the Chicken Meat Federation sought the increase in order to incorporate greater flexibility into the industry's long-term planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports this legislation. It is perhaps timely to consider the value of the chicken meat industry. So often we consider the primary industries legislation and the impact that it has on Australia very much in the context of the big ticket items such as wheat, wool, beef and other agricultural products; often we do not give the due importance that we should to the chicken meat industry because it is a very large and expanding industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, as an industry it receives little publicity but it has quietly transformed itself from its backyard status&mdash;most recently as late as the 1960s&mdash;to a modern, dynamic industry which places second only to beef in the meat production stakes. Some 40 years ago, Australians consumed about three million birds annually, or less than half a kilogram of chicken meat each over the course of a year. The situation is now radically different. In 1993-94, we collectively munched our way through 325 million birds. That is a surprising figure: 325 million chickens includes 650 million drumsticks which equates to a consumption level of 27.4 kilograms of chicken meat per capita. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite easy from those figures to see how our diet in Australia is changing. Of course, because of the product and because of the value of chicken meat, the chicken meat industry is certainly taking a very large chunk out of the traditional meat industry's per capita consumption. They are certainly surprising figures.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that in perspective, each Australian consumed the equivalent of two Kentucky Fried Chicken snack packs or three McChickens or perhaps 13 bowls of chicken noodle soup each week for a whole year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suffice to say, we Australians like our chicken. Not only do we enjoy the taste and health benefits of chicken meat; we gain substantially from the economic benefits of the industry. The chicken meat industry directly employs about 16,000 people and about 45,000 people are indirectly involved. The current value of sales at a retail level is approaching $1.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is timely to point out that because this is an intensive animal feeding industry it is going to be affected by the drought. The cost of grain in Australia has been brought about and may be a direct result of the raging drought that we have seen across the eastern states of Australia over the last four years. Grain prices for the chicken meat industry are going to rise and they have already risen. That is going to place an increasing burden on the viability of the chicken meat industry. In turn, those costs have either got to be absorbed by the industry or passed on to the consumer. If they pass directly on to the consumer, we are going to see an inflationary impact on the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drought has wider ramifications than the plight of those who are directly involved who we see on a day-to-day basis in the rural electorates of Australia. It will impact on the national economy; it will impact on the CPI&mdash;the consumer price index, the cost of living in Australia. That is a direct result of the drought. That is why we do need to see from the government today a national response to this great tragedy that is out there in rural Australia. It does deserve, albeit too late for many, a national response. That national response must cover the impact that this drought is having on communities, families and industries because it is a national disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous potential for export development but the industry in Australia remains hamstrung by the high cost of capital, the high cost of labour and other inputs, and the subsidies provided to the chicken meat industry in competing countries. The United States and the European Union are particularly aggressive protectors of their domestic chicken meat industries. Thailand has rapidly assumed a prominent position amongst the world's chicken meat exporters by relying on tax incentives to lure foreign investment, and cheap labour, to build a most efficient industry in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible relaxation of Australian quarantine regulations relating to imported chicken meat is of great concern to the domestic industry. This concern is twofold. Naturally, there is concern for the impact on local producers, but just as important is the concern for the possible introduction of the world's most feared disease in the poultry industry, the Newcastle virus. I applaud the chicken meat industry for the high standards it supports and upholds&mdash;in particular, with regard to its approach to hygiene, disease eradication and quality control. I sincerely hope that the industry's commitment to development and innovation is matched by a similar level of commitment from the federal government to eliminate factors which impede the industry's growth, whilst maintaining secure quarantine restrictions. We all benefit from agricultural products in Australia which are clean and green and are the envy of many other countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994 end the current levy exemption for wine producers producing less than 10 tonnes of fresh grapes, place a maximum limit on the amount of levy that is used to support marketing, and increase the limit on the research and development component. A proportion of the money raised through the wine grapes levy finances the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. This body is responsible for wine promotion, administration of the wine label integrity program, export control and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remainder funds the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Funding spent on research is matched by the government on a dollar for dollar basis. I understand that both the Australian Wine Makers Forum and the Independent Winemakers, both of which represent small winemakers, support the alteration proposed by this legislation. The coalition will be supporting the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wine industry continues to be a primary industry of great success. As the reputation of our wine spreads throughout the world, our export trade continues to strengthen. In 1994-95, it is estimated we will export 162 million litres of wine. This amounts to an increase of almost 400 per cent since 1989-90. In value terms, the exports are expected to come close to $500 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most exciting developments in the wine industry is the agreement reached between Australia and the European Community, which was negotiated late in 1992 and signed in January this year. This agreement will result in the improved access of Australian wine to European markets and eliminate technical trade barriers, in return for the phasing out of the use of European geographical names as names for Australian wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The search for new names to replace beaujolais, hock, madeira, chianti and, eventually, champagne, chablis, moselle and many others will be a challenge for Australian winemakers. It does, however, provide an enormous opportunity for Australian wines to further establish their particular market niche with distinctive and unique names. It will be a formidable task to educate the wine drinkers of the world to accept the new names. I do not underestimate that task, because people have for so long associated the variety of a wine with a region, and it is going to be extremely difficult and a great challenge, obviously, to the wine industry to develop new names which will be identifiable the world over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for an industry which has displayed enormous marketing and product development prowess, I feel that it is a challenge to which the wine industry is certainly capable of rising. I recently noticed an Australian wine selling under the name of `Antarctic White'. That seemed to me to be an excellent example of a name which provides a clear impression of the wine's style whilst also establishing the wine's geographic origin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting to my electorate very shortly. This agreement is a great example of the wine industry's foresight and vision. I have no doubt that the industry will achieve its $1 billion annual exports target set for the year 2000. It is a wonderful example to us all to see that an industry out there has a target which it wants to achieve; it has a plan. We can only wish the wine industry well, and let us hope that it does reach that target before the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we consider the impact the drought is having on our Australian wine industry. In my electorate, in the granite belt, we have got an emerging wine industry. It has been there for a long time, but it is expanding. One of the limiting factors to the expansion of that wine industry is water. It is time that this nation looked more seriously at a national water strategy. We so often find that our agricultural potential is limited by the impact of drought. Whilst we look at the social issues, I do not think we have looked fully at trying to drought proof Australia through the implementation of a national water strategy. That is a debate that deserves the attention of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now address the final piece of legislation which we are considering in this cognate debate. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 covers a range of small changes to various primary industry acts. I will confine my comments this morning to the amendments proposed to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. This act governs the operation of the farm household support scheme, designed to provide assistance to farmers who are unable to meet day-to-day living expenses and who cannot access commercial finance. The scheme also provides a financial incentive for farmers wishing to leave the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for farm household support, the applicant must be an Australian farmer between 16 years of age and the pension age, with a certificate of inability to obtain finance. The assistance is provided for a period of nine months. If during that time the farmer leaves the farm, the assistance becomes a grant. If the farmer remains in the industry, the assistance must be repaid at commercial interest rates. Those who leave the industry within the nine-month period will receive the balance payable for the period as a lump sum, in addition to their re-establishment grant of $45,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes a small but important change to the administrative arrangements for farm household support. It extends, from 14 to 30 days, the time allowed for farm household support applicants to obtain a certificate of inability to access finance. A great number of farmers have experienced difficulty in obtaining a certificate within 14 days, owing largely to the obvious problems they face in physically accessing financial institutions. I am pleased that the government has acknowledged this difficulty and acted in the manner that it has in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the farm household support scheme is, in theory, a useful mode of assistance to farmers who face insurmountable financial difficulties, its practical application has proved to be thwarted by inconsistencies and anomalies. For example, the re-establishment payments are limited to one per farm, regardless of the number of people or families who work on that farm. In the event of two families running one farm in cooperation, only one can receive the re-establishment grant. One wonders what happens to the other family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also strikes me as particularly counterproductive for farm household support to be converted to a loan for those who do not leave farming. The assistance is provided, after all, for those who cannot obtain commercial finance. It seems perfectly obvious that the last thing these people need is another loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to remember that leaving farming is not such an easy task at the moment. Many producers right through the drought areas of Australia who make a decision to leave find it impossible to sell and liquidate their farm in order to move off that land within nine months. They have assets which may have a paper value but have no resale value in the current circumstances. So the legislation is quite ludicrous in its application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some drought-ravaged farmers literally cannot give their farms away. So despite their best efforts farmers will still find themselves unable to access further commercial finance and incurring another debt because they go over the nine-month limit for moving off their land. Their inability to access further finance is the reason they went onto farm household support in the first place but once they access farm household support they have their feet on the sticky paper and cannot get them off. Unable to access finance, they are caught in a trap, all of which demonstrates the government's insensitive treatment of farmers around Australia, particularly in these drought ravaged times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising then that only 392 farmers are currently accessing farm household support. The government itself estimated that at least 1,200 would access this support. Government members were congratulating themselves because they were going to be giving household support to farmers in these very difficult times, but the farmers know that once they access that farm household support it is a one-way ticket off the farm and that if they do not go they have incurred another loan, which will incur commercial rates of interest after nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the policy of the coalition to allow farm household support to be provided as a grant for 12 months, irrespective of whether the farmer chooses to leave the industry. This clearly recognises the need to provide assistance to meet day-to-day needs without creating additional debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving an amendment on behalf of the coalition which encourages the government to adopt our strategy for administering farm household support. I would hope that the government will accept our amendment. Any of those government members who have been out to the drought areas and have been  in touch with the farmers, the farm industry leaders and church organisations such as Lifeline and the Salvation Army will know that farm household support as it applies under government legislation is failing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to decide at a round table conference to give $25 million to ANL and to offer the people of Sydney $150 million overnight to remove the Cahill Expressway, but it is not good enough to support farm households with income support for 12 months without strings attached. This callous approach of the government must be changed. I hope the opposition's amendment will be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment also calls on the government to modify the assets test applied to other forms of assistance. There is no doubt that the assets tests applied to benefits such as jobsearch, family payment and Austudy are denying farmers access to assistance to which they and their families are clearly entitled. I sincerely hope that the government addresses this problem in the course of its cabinet deliberations today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true tragedy is that whatever rabbit the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) are able to pull from the hat today, it will simply be too late for many farmers. It will certainly be too late for many students who have already been forced to interrupt their study program because their parents can no longer continue to keep them living away from home whilst they gain access to tertiary studies. It will be too late for those skilled and experienced farmers who have already left the industry. It will also be too late for the marriages and relationships which have endured unbearable strain over the past two, three and four years. The government must bear the full brunt of the blame for these consequences, most of which are due entirely to its inaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister made a statement that drought in this country is a normal occurrence and a part of rural life. I hope that, when he went to Central Queensland and the Darling Downs, what he saw there was not a normal part of rural life. The government's silence on this issue still indicates to the opposition that it does not understand the plight of those in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not only talking about those on the land. We are also talking about the small businesses in the country towns and the workers who work for those small businesses. In the country town of Augathella the other day, a small business person rang me and said that he had just shut his small business and put off his worker because he could not continue running his business in that country town. He also said that, in the last four months, seven families had just walked out of their homes and left the town. They could not sell their house. They could not get a job in the area. They have just walked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ramifications of this drought go far beyond the farm gate. They are well into the small business sector of the nation, particularly in these drought areas. It is certainly impacting on many families, whether they own a small business or whether they have got a job working for someone in these rural drought areas. I think the full impact of this drought and the drift of population from rural areas will be measured for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians are waiting to hear what the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy say today in the package for rural families affected by drought. The package has to extend to assistance to small business. It has got to extend into the area of welfare and it has got to extend into the farmer's financial problems. It has to address those problems. It really took a television personality and Australia wide support for a farmhand appeal before we saw a government willing to move and to visit the drought areas of this nation. I think it is a great tragedy that a government and a Prime Minister could be so out of touch that it took a television personality and the Australian people's contribution to that farmhand appeal to drag in the Prime Minister, albeit in a damage control mode, to see first-hand what was happening to families, small businesses and farmers in drought ravaged Australia. Whilst the coalition will not be denying this bill a second reading, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the Main Committee, recognising the needs of individuals and families living in rural and regional Australia who face the ravages of severe drought, calls on the Government to make farm household support a grant for up to 12 months and to modify the assets test for other forms of assistance".</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the government will accept that amendment. If it does not, and if it does not address those issues in the package today, the opposition will be pursuing the government relentlessly on this issue. </PARA>

I rise to support the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. I will not be supporting the amendment as proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I anticipate that the package that the cabinet is deliberating on and will announce will take on board the concerns registered by the member for Maranoa. I do not believe his suggestion is the way to handle this problem, although I recognise that there are problems associated with the farm household support scheme. It should be noted that this was an attempt to provide for those families who need to be assisted to leave a primary industry. We do not do it in any other industrial sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech by the honourable member for Maranoa, which we all suffered in silence, and the MPI in the House of Representatives yesterday are desperate attempts by those in the National Party to play catch-up. Once again, they have lost the initiative and they have dealt themselves out of the main game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about the member for Maranoa and, to an extent, some media misrepresentation of comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in my electorate on 19 July in relation to drought. The Prime Minister has not changed his position. In response to a question on the drought, he said that drought is a continuing factor in this nation. I have spoken to primary producers in central and western Queensland about seasons, and they are the first to admit that this has been a major problem over 60 years on the one land-holding, that often properties are more in drought than out of it, and that across the country at some point in time, and even in the same regions, drought declarations happen very frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's view is that this government will be about bringing in a systemic set of provisions to deal with a very complex issue in our agricultural sector. I think it would be useful to comment on the sort of policy on the run that the National Party is into. We should not look to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>, which is the bible of most rural producers. It is not surprising to see that the constituency of the National Farmers Federation is sometimes behind its leaders. This was brought home to me during the Prime Minister's tour to central Queensland with representatives from the National Farmers Federation, the Queensland Grains Council and the United Graziers Association. We should not be surprised that peak leaders of organisations are often further advanced in their views because they have the bigger picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer, Mr Deputy Speaker, to an article by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>'s rural writer, Tim Stevens, on 9 September.

The aim of that visit was to further inform other cabinet members on the issues of the drought. It is simply not the case that this government is not interested or sensitive to drought issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that a conservative politician bearing $90 million in gifts is shown the door by farm leaders. Yet this was the reaction from Coalition backbenchers and the National Farmers Federation to the release of the Opposition's drought policy last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy's key feature, a $90 million scheme to pay for fodder for livestock in "severe" drought areas, was interpreted as a blatant reversion by the Liberal and National parties to the days of unfunded promises, when policies were based overwhelmingly on populist agrarian notions rather than sounder economic rationales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might add that when the Prime Minister visited and talked with farming families near Dingo he made the point that he was not going to be into cheap gestures and feel-good policies. What this government is about is sound, economically based policies that will provide significant assistance to farming families and to the agricultural sector. Why was this critique made? It was apparently decided on 22 August by a shadow cabinet meeting that drought was obviously going to be a key issue. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was decided that a comprehensive response was needed of the Government's policies and this was interpreted by John Anderson, the Coalition's primary industries spokesman, as a desire to have a detailed policy and off he went to find one.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.They provide a disincentive for producers to prepare for drought, which includes the making and storing of hay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.They tend to jolt demand, sending fodder prices through the roof.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Fodder suppliers and users have rorted the system.</PARA>
<PARA>I will go on quoting Mr Stevens:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Curiously, Anderson mentioned his policies to no one. Despite the stated desire of Opposition Leader Alexander Downer to involve all of the Liberal and National party political processes in decision-making, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian</EMPHASIS> has been unable to speak to anyone whose views were sought on drought issues prior to the announcement.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Farmers Federation was not consulted. The shadow minister did not bother to go on and consult the peak organisation, and in public and in private&mdash;although not quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the peak farming bodies of this country were scathing in their criticism. I further quote Mr Stevens:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman of the Coalition parliamentary primary industries committee, Neil Andrew&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>who I see is in the Main Committee room today&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little time was spent debating the policy in the shadow Cabinet of August 29, despite the potential fiscal size of the package, although one proposal from Anderson for concessional loans&mdash;to help reconstruct the sector after the drought ends&mdash;was sent to a special shadow Cabinet sub-committee. The rest was ticked and sent to a joint meeting of the Liberal National parties the next day, before being released just over one week after shadow Cabinet first asked for a policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, this is the way the Coalition's policy making process works these days. There were no offsets sought by shadow Cabinet to counterbalance the increased expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Nationals, it appears on the surface, have reverted to the good old days of pork barrelling and unfunded campaign promises, with the blessing of the Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA>This, Mr Deputy Speaker, is the sorry state of opposition policy building. This is the policy you have when you try to have a policy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tell us about your policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZU5">Ms HENZELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are going to have an excellent policy. The Prime Minister's tour was not brought on by the media; it was brought on because the Labor government has more rural representatives in this parliament than the National Party does, and we have a vested interest in making sure that the concerns of the rural and agricultural sector of this country are taken into account. But it will not be done by feel-good throwing money at the problem. It will be done by a systematic approach, to provide effective changes to the rural adjustment scheme and effective responses to the obvious needs and pressures on farm families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the factors that I have certainly put forward, apart from looking at an effective way to make sure that the children of farming families are able to access assistance with their schooling, is an issue that has not made the headlines but was put to us at a property south of Charters Towers. It is that we are not talking about only the education of older children, who will need to go away to boarding school to get an education. It is vital that those children do get that education, because it is very clear that many of those children will choose not to return to family properties. They will choose to go into other sectors of the economy. Like all other children in this country, they need to have access to educational opportunities, in order to either choose to go into other sectors or become effective farm managers. Gone are the days when people could go to year 10 and then just go back and learn the job from their parents. The farm sector, like every other industrial sector, has to change and become much more effective in terms of targeting niche markets and so on. It is now a highly skilled operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I want to make comment on those children who are being educated at home. The story I want to tell the members attending the Main Committee this morning is one of a young mother who came to the meeting with a 10-week-old baby, the fourth of her children; she had three other children at home. She was lucky enough to have her mother staying with her prior to the birth of this baby, and subsequent to its birth. This young mother is teaching the seven-year-old at home. Nowadays, that is a full day's occupation. It is not just a matter of setting up some work and going away to do the housework; you are in the schoolroom all day. The second child has been classified as a gifted child, and will, therefore, need particular assistance if its abilities are going to be really provided for. The third child is a toddler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, a mother with a 10-week-old baby should be, basically, doing what she can in the house and then feeding that baby and looking after it. At the point in time when this mother came to this meeting with the Attorney-General and myself, her husband had cattle away on agistment, so the only support person she had to look after herself and her four children was her mother. Had her mother not been available, I do not know who would have washed the nappies. I have drawn to the attention of the Prime Minister and other members of the cabinet that we must make sure we are providing for support so that women in this kind of predicament can access assistance. Obviously, it is difficult for families with young children when they drive into town&mdash;which may be a two- or three-hour drive&mdash;to go to the doctor, just to arrange for occasional child care. At least in Charters Towers there are some doctors who bulk-bill. In many cases in country Queensland, and certainly in Rockhampton, there are almost no doctors who bulk-bill, causing further financial pressure on these families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure members opposite that these family concerns are being addressed, and certainly were addressed by the Prime Minister. As I said yesterday in the caucus meeting, it was very interesting that what was said on the national media was very true during our visit to Timbaroo at Dingo. Farming families were really quite shocked by the fact that, in meeting the Prime Minister, they had to wrestle with their preconceptions about the sort of person he was. Of course, their preconceptions had been based on television media presentations of the Prime Minister, and articles in magazines such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>. What they found was a warm, caring, concerned person who spoke with feeling and was able to yarn on their level. That has been a very important experience for that group of people. I assure you that the Prime Minister is not someone who flourishes a bit of rhetoric just to provide a bit of popular grandstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point he made at that meeting was: just as we made a commitment not to leave the unemployed behind, we will not leave country people behind. We are aware of the concerns and we will respond to those concerns. We do not need the National Party to bleat here today and to play catch-up to tell this government what is required to provide for people through this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I have raised with the Prime Minister is that, as we look at the crisis and the tragedy that is happening to people in this drought, we will certainly have to look at issues about land care and environmental degradation. I will just quote from the minister's second reading speech. In connection with the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly they will ensure that ecologically sustainable development principles are written into the charter of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and that the membership of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation will include, in future, expertise in environmental and ecological matters.</PARA>
<PARA>This is going to be an issue that has certainly been brought into stark relief by the drought. What we see, following the extension of rural and agricultural pursuits into marginal country, particularly across northern Queensland, is that where we have drought conditions we have a major long-term impact on the environmental status of the land. An example would have been when Capella, which has had drought for six to eight seasons, got a deluge of rain&mdash;seven inches in 24 hours. This is pretty typical; it is up the road from Emerald. In a good season, it is one of the most beautiful areas of this country. If we have a droughted area with extensive clearing and then there is a deluge of rain, we have a massive erosion problem. This is a factor that will have to be addressed and will be addressed by this government. We cannot simply allow extension of dry land farming into marginal areas if we expect to keep this country together, ecologically speaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from an article by Wallace Brown in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> on 4 September. He was being critical that there was not an effective drought policy. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the latest survey by the National Farmers' Federation and the Australian Conservation Foundation, being joint sponsors of the Landcare program, shows increasing desertification due to clearing of trees and other native vegetation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alarming to read that 5000 square km of native vegetation is still being cleared each year in Australia, and that this is an amount comparable to the area cleared in the Amazon Basin, which environmentalists world-wide condemn.</PARA>
<PARA>We have to face the fact that we have to get back to restoring this country to ecologically sustainable development. Now, belatedly I believe, farming organisations and the National Farmers Federation have come on board on this. This is a very important issue in the government's drought policy. It is not going to be more dams, more water. I have had well-meaning and very caring people who want to train water into rural sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is good to see, as unfortunate as it is, that at this time of drought there are very few cattle in the middle of my electorate because the land simply cannot sustain those cattle. We have to recognise that. Yes, indeed, we have to look after breeding stock, but we will not do it by the ill-thought out, ill-considered policies with which the National Party is desperately trying to hold on to its constituency. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, at the end of the day, the Labor government is increasingly going to take on board that rural constituency. In fact, one of the farmers at the Dingo meeting said to the Prime Minister that he may well be the Prime Minister who saves the bush. As the Prime Minister said in response, that is a very big ask but it will be this government which will put forward very positive policies that will be to the long-term benefit of the rural sector and ecologically sustainable development in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So why is our national Government so out of step with the opinions of its citizens, choosing instead to fiddle while rural Australia withers?</PARA>
<PARA>That is by the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>. If the member for Capricornia is genuine in her sentiments that the Labor Party is going to meet the needs of rural Australia, it ought to be a lot more in touch with what the people there think of its government. People are asking: why can decisions be made, on the run and outside cabinet, that can contribute $150 million to a so-called eyesore in Sydney? This decision was made on the run, outside the executive, by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). How can sweetheart deals outside cabinet and outside the parliament be made on the run with the Maritime Union of Australia? How can those decisions be made on the run?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are desperate primary producers in the member for Maranoa's electorate. Sadly, the cancerous drought is spreading all the way through New South Wales. Now even in my own electorate of Mallee there will be grain growers who will not harvest wheat or grain of any sort this year because the drought is extending across Australia. They are asking: why do we have to wait three years for decent consideration? This drought has not suddenly arrived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of questions the constituency is asking. It is a pity the member for Capricornia has not stayed. I would suggest that she should get out there and ask the people what they think of the initiatives we announced. Rural Australia is not outer suburbia. Rural Australia is the people out there producing the wealth in the sparsely populated areas of Australia. I think the Labor Party has got a lot of work to do if it thinks it can sustain the confidence of rural Australia. I am not talking about urban suburbs. We are talking about rural Australia where there are 130,000 people in 70-odd thousand square kilometres that are sparsely populated but produce the nation's wealth. They want to know why the government can be so hypocritical in its efforts to help its union mates and to preserve the aesthetics for the Prime Minister when they have to wait for decent consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have been earning this nation's wealth for years&mdash;paying for the excessive income we have for imported goods&mdash;and they are asking for better consideration and a better deal.

I will leave it to other members from our side who are present to talk more about the initiatives in our policy other than the fodder subsidy. We talk about reinstalling drought in the national disasters relief arrangements. For the Prime Minister to say that primary producers are expected to prepare for four years of drought indicates how out of touch he is. He has got a long way to go if he is going to save the bush, as the member for Maranoa has said. </PARA>

The sad contrast was that, with the advantages and asset of the Murray River as an irrigation source, 50 kilometres to the south, we will see grain growers feeding their wheat to their sheep. This is the sad plight of the extension of this drought.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Swan Hill, my home city, we have a large agricultural machinery producer, producing disc ploughs and marketing right across Australia, to Western Australia, Queensland and indeed, recently, even expanding into exporting. Sadly, a fortnight ago, the firm had to put off five young people, including one apprentice, because of the impact of the drought. That is the extent of the national disaster. It is not just a problem for the Queenslanders. We have heard the stories from members representing those areas&mdash;but the drought does extend. There are now five families in Swan Hill upon which the drought has had a direct impact. Their income will be reduced to the extent that they will not be spending in Swan Hill, and so other businesses are impacted by the effects of the drought. It is a national disaster&mdash;we have said clearly that this should be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrigation from the Murray River, as I have said, is one of the saving resources of an electorate like mine, which is so dependent on the elements. The member for Maranoa has spoken about a number of my industries. He has referred to chickens, and I would much rather focus on horticulture. No-one was more disappointed than me, when I arrived here as a new member of parliament, to listen to the government's August  budget in 1993, and hear its proposals to tax the wine industry. The member for Maranoa has already spoken in glowing terms about the expansion that this industry is providing in wealth earning and job creation. The objective of this industry is, by the turn of the century, to triple its export development, which is the billion dollar program that the member for Maranoa has mentioned to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home town of Red Cliffs, Lindemans wines some 20-odd years ago invested substantial amounts in infrastructure and can now boast one of the largest wineries in the southern hemisphere. Subsequent owners of that winery have continued to invest, because they see real opportunities in meeting the targets in the expansion of the wine industry generally. The employment base that that winery now provides to a small community like Red Cliffs, a small rural town which has a population of around about 1,500, is worth millions of dollars to that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of real regional development in the most successful terms. I think the government needs to recognise this and encourage enterprises at every opportunity. That is real regional development, that is development that creates jobs. The prospect of a prosperous future in wine grape production gives the community some sense of optimism for the future. I therefore suggest to the government, and those of its members that are present here today, that on all occasions it should work very carefully, through its taxation policies, to ensure that bright, new, expansive industries are encouraged in every way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment further on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I know that other speakers following will probably do the subject more justice than I can, and the member for Maranoa has already commented on it, but I would like give my observations on how the farm household support scheme is not working. I continue to focus on horticulture. Around the Sunraysia region of my electorate, I have got two principal industries, citrus and dried vine fruit. Both these industries have been asked to bear the pain of being sacrificed on the great altar of free trade. I was annoyed last week, when there were negotiations in respect of the Australian National Line, to hear the union movement arguing its case, saying that its people could not be expected to compete with Third World labour rates. I feel that it is gross hypocrisy that the government has listened to this argument and invested substantial amounts of taxpayers' funds to preserve jobs in that industry. Yet my two industries, worth probably $200 to $250 million dollars per annum just in my electorate, are being asked to compete with cheap labour from Turkey in regard to dried vine fruit and extremely cheap labour and the benefits of critical mass out of Brazil in respect of citrus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government how it can tolerate this style of hypocrisy. Many of my constituents would say that, true, the ultimate goal must be world free trade and a level playing field and that we are going to have a considerable amount of pain in getting there. They would not mind bearing some of this pain, provided it is shared by all Australians. When an announcement is made outside the cabinet and outside the parliament in regard to the Australian National Line, they just see gross hypocrisy, given that for years now they have been asked to bear considerable pain, go without and even have to suffer the indignity of deciding which of their children will be able to pursue tertiary education. That is a terrible decision for parents to have to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of them, particularly in dried vine fruit, elected to take the option in regard to farm household support. Sadly, the situation is that, whilst they were genuine initially in their efforts to discharge their obligation in respect of the ownership of their property, the market is such that there are probably something like 1,000 dried vine fruit properties on the market in the Sunraysia district and properties just do not sell. We have now got a significant number of people who have taken farm household support, gone beyond their nine months, cannot sell their properties and now have to sustain what is being transferred as a commercial loan at commercial interest rates, rates well in excess of 10 per cent. This is an added financial burden on their ability to cope or even to consider how they can restructure and be part of a new industry and to take the opportunities that wine grapes are providing for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of their significant debt as well as this additional debt to the rural finance corporation, I am very concerned about their ability to meet this exciting new initiative in wine grapes, so I put to the government that it should give greater consideration to the wealth producers of my electorate as well as consider the national disaster that this drought represents. I also suggest that when it makes its announcements it should defend itself with respect to the time it has taken to announce drought policy to meet the needs of hurting people, particularly Queenslanders and people from New South Wales, because those people can see hypocrisy in terms of the way the government assists its friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remind members of the government of a number of problems with regard to salinity control and the sustaining of water reserves in the Murray-Darling Basin. In fact, this summer there is no doubt that the Darling River will have a blue-green algal burst that will see the last one in 1992 fade into insignificance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My horticulturalists are being asked to contribute to salinity mitigation from a variety of sources, but to do so while their financial circumstances are so fragile is an additional burden they cannot sustain. Some are being asked to contribute to modifications to their supply system where open channels are being converted to pipelines, which often requires a capital cost contribution. Others are being asked to make contributions through local government levies through their municipal rates. I put it to the government that the ability of the horticulturalists to meet these contributions has been substantially eroded by years of neglect and that it is time that the Minister for Resources, the honourable member for Rankin (Mr Beddall), and the government considered the dried vine fruit growers and citrus growers in my electorate. </PARA>

Nevertheless, through its educative and technical expertise, the industry is now exporting quite strongly offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to think that Australia is a little bit too free and easy with its technical expertise in the sense that we are quite ready to share our expertise with overseas producers so that they become our competitors in some way. However, we seem to be holding our own with the quality and the value for quality wines that we are exporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of other bills, the farm household support scheme has come in for some debate here this morning. The changes to that are just one part of the whole package of support which is available to rural industries and which, no doubt, will be further expanded in the announcements that I would expect to come from the government today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that some of the changes that are mooted will further extend the government's position as a government which is able to listen and to deliver policies of support to various industries that might be running into difficulty, particularly the workers and the employers in those industries. If there was anything which the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) hinted at in her fine contribution to this debate this morning, it was the fact that the government already has in place many policies which are assisting farm families and workers in rural industries across Australia, particularly those that are affected by drought. The response from any government of any persuasion should never be a hip-pocket response to cast money towards the problem and simply to pretend that that is all it has to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing which has marked responses in the past, it has been that that sort of policy and something like the fodder subsidy which has been bandied about in the last few days, both within the House and in the media, have not produced productive responses or results in the long run. The member for Maranoa in his contribution this morning hinted at the effects of inflation that will be flowing through the Australian economy as a result of the drought and the subsequent increase in prices. A simple thing like a drought subsidy, when it is abused, does not necessarily reduce the price of fodder to a particular farmer or farming enterprise and, itself, if it is abused, has obviously contributed to the flow-on effects of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the member for Maranoa was waxing lyrical about the effects of inflation, flow-on effects and the containment of costs in that area, I really took a big breath and thought he was going to go all the way. But instead he took a little diversion and went back to the National Party's pet subject, the impact of what he perceives as the effects of work practices on costs of primary producers. In terms of the shortage of grain, particularly feed grain to industries, that flow-on effect is something which is very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I took a big breath is that I thought the member for Maranoa was going to go on and elaborate a little bit more on the effects of the increase in grain price on other industries. As the chicken meat industry is another industry that is affected by one of these bills, the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill, I thought the member for Maranoa may have said a little bit about the impost of that increase in grain price on the chicken meat industry. Whatever perceived inadequacies the member for Maranoa attempted to allude to in his contribution this morning with regard to work practices that he thought had to be changed, without his actually spelling out what they are, certainly the impost of the increased price of feed grain going into the chicken industry is something which that industry is most concerned about. The member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) is going to correct me because he is an expert on this, but the elasticity in the price of chicken meat means that, as the price of chicken meat goes up even a moderate amount, consumers will swing away to other meat products. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we had an excellent lunch based on various value adding types of chicken which they are selling to the market. I do not know whether, under the present debate on some other laws, the honourable member for Page and I must declare that lunch. Nevertheless, I would like to point out that over our luncheon we were able to discuss with the management, and also with DEET officers who were present, the way in which the government employment schemes have been able to assist the business&mdash;through training and wage subsidies and so forth&mdash;to take on and reskill staff to step up into the new demands of that industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has changed substantially, particularly in the last 10 years, towards value adding. It is no longer simply selling bodies of chickens in the different sizes that we might be familiar with and that were presented in the supermarket for many years. The business is actually deboning and doing all sorts of other things to the chicken meat to make it more presentable and much more attractive to the purchaser, and it is competing with the other meat industries which are also present in my electorate and that of the honourable member for Page and also in the electorates of the members on the other side. I refer, obviously, to the pork, lamb and beef industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the changes to the national residue survey administration for the meat chicken industry have been accepted by industry players across Australia. Obviously, with the support of the members on both sides of the House, these bills will go through and will, I hope, further add to the strength of the industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been various comments made about the timeliness of the farm household support changes which are contained within these bills. As I mentioned earlier in my discussions here this morning, the changes add to what is already in place to assist farm families and employers across Australia in rural industries which are affected by the drought. I am fortunate, in the sense that mine is probably the only electorate in New South Wales which has not been drought declared. If there are other such electorates, they might be Sydney itself and right down the bottom in the southern parts of Australia. I certainly appreciate the difficulties that the electorates of the honourable member for Page and the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), and the industries in those areas, are facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various changes which are in place for farm household support are all about assisting farm families. The almost nigglingly small change which has been put forward in the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maranoa&mdash;without any explanation as to why he was tweaking it up that extra very small amount&mdash;is a bit of a kite flying exercise. The other part of the amendment which has been moved is something which has already been flagged very strongly in the media and through the Labor caucus as something that we were quite strongly prepared to do, and I look forward to seeing the announcements this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why not accept these amendments? Because they do not actually relate to the bill which would require amendment in here, and hence they are a little out of place and are certainly out of keeping with the nature of the debate which is normally allowed for in this chamber. The series of bills, as I said in my introduction, is simply some finetuning of aspects of various bills for the primary industries. Without doubt, members on both sides&mdash;despite what has been moved here this morning&mdash;will be supporting them, and I do so as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to take some umbrage at the comments made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) and by my friend the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell). I particularly take umbrage at the member for Richmond's illustration of the opposition&mdash;a coalition, I hasten to remind him&mdash;as the Johnny-come-latelys who are running behind the bus and waving a ticket saying, `We missed out.' I happen to think that it is almost indecent for anyone to rise in this Main Committee chamber or in the House, in the light of the present disaster of the drought, and claim to have some sort of monopoly on rural wisdom or on the way in which assistance should be offered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cruel reality is that none of us has got anything to brag about. We have all responded belatedly to a desperate need in rural Australia. I think it is quite improper for the member for Capricornia to suggest there should be, in some sense, an apology from the opposition for having pursued the issues it pursued in order to get recognition of what was happening with the drought. It is equally improper, if I may say so, for the member for Richmond to suggest that in some way there is something superbly better about the government's package, and awfully inferior about the opposition's. I was having some difficulty in finding an appropriate analogy but it struck me that it was almost like both of us wandering around Rwanda with a bag full of rice, with one team saying to the other, `We've got a more attractive ladle for doling out the rice than you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, we have a nation with a real, acute, almost insurmountable problem that calls, in this instance, for a parliamentary reaction&mdash;not a government or an opposition reaction. I was not amused, though not entirely surprised, that the member for Capricornia&mdash;not uncharitably, I hasten to add, but nonetheless in a rather political exercise&mdash;read from an editorial by Tim Stevens referring to the coalition's drought policy. In it I was quoted by Mr Stevens as not having been adequately consulted&mdash;as the counterpart in the coalition, as it were, of the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods)&mdash;on the question of the coalition's drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly true for Mr Stevens to say that I was not consulted. In fact, he rang me after the drought policy had been announced and asked whether I or my committee had been consulted. He said that it had been intimated to him that we had not been. I indicated that, no, we had not been. But I was not offended by that. I recognised that the shadow minister for primary industry had a deadline to meet; that he had taken the policy to the shadow cabinet and it had met with shadow cabinet approval; that it had not been unfunded, as alleged by Mr Stevens or by the member for Capricornia, in that he had also sought and gained the approval of the shadow treasurer; and that it came to me prior to its release so that it could be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There simply was not a time to call the committee together and, as anyone from the coalition would attest, it has not been a matter of any tension between coalition members or between members of the Liberal and National parties independently. To suggest that I was sitting there uneasily alongside the shadow minister for primary industry at this press conference would be something of a misnomer, I have to confess. Those who know me well enough know I am sufficient of a politician not to be uneasy about any sort of publicity. I must add that there was some contest for the opportunity to be seated alongside the shadow minister for primary industry, a contest I am pleased to say I won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to pick up the point made by the member for Capricornia and run from time to time by members opposite, suggesting that in some way the National Farmers Federation and all farming bodies have suggested the coalition was way off course with its particular version of the way in which the desperate need facing Australian farmers should be met. Can I say that my experience, from conversations with the National Farmers Federation representatives of recent times, has been that they are regretting their rather outspoken criticism of only one sector of the coalition's proposal&mdash;the proposal for fodder subsidy. My own farmers organisation, the South Australian Farmers Federation, has from day one endorsed and embraced this entire package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest I fall into the same trap as I am accusing my friends opposite of having entered, this is not a case of saying, `Look how much better our policy is than yours.' This is a case of the coalition members standing here and saying that there is a desperate need. We recognise that the government is taking steps to address that need, and we believe that changes could be made to improve the way in which the need, which is currently felt by drought stricken farmers across Australia, is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those changes has been addressed by the member for Richmond. In his closing remarks, I think he said it was `niggardly small', meaning it was a very small change that the coalition was seeking. In the light of that debate, I simply ask: if that is the case, why is it that the government has so much trouble accepting this coalition amendment? The coalition does not seek a great deal. It seeks simply to improve the way in which farm household support is made available to farmers and to extend the period of availability, without strings attached, to 12 months instead of nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not an unreasonable request, but it is dismissed out of hand by the government as if anything proposed by the coalition was bound to be the wrong thing to do. I find that a difficult exercise to come to terms with because&mdash;rather like the land grant&mdash;here I am as part of the coalition saying, `We accept that these things need to happen, so let us see if we can improve on them'; but I have a government not even entertaining my amendment. I must say I find that somewhat disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Capricornia was also very critical of what she saw as the coalition's reaction to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he would not leave country people behind. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, the problem is simply this: we are facing a drought that is now four years old. We would be failing in our role as the coalition if we had not been</PARA>
<PARA>prodding and poking the Prime Minister into taking action, and we would be failing today if we were simply observing that it took him longer than it should have taken him to be aware of what is happening, particularly in Queensland and in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said by the member of Capricornia that when the people of Queensland met the Prime Minister face to face they found that the preconceptions they had of him were without foundation and that he was really quite a gregarious fellow. I am genuinely pleased that that is the case. It is a comment that after 11 years in this place as a member of the federal parliament I could have made, and have made from time to time, about the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. I am sorry to say that it is a comment I find it more difficult to make about the present Prime Minister; not because I want to be critical, but because after 11 years in this place I have never had an opportunity to experience what I do not doubt is his capacity to be gregarious. It is but something he never extends in any sense to coalition members. The preconception that is abroad in the community is very much the result of the way the Prime Minister deals with us, rather than something that we have sought deliberately to cultivate or foster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that the coalition is seeking are, in the words of the member for Richmond, small changes. We believe they improve the way in which assistance will be delivered to people in drought stricken Queensland and New South Wales, and for that reason we are proposing these amendments and seeking government support for them. We are certainly not seeking to have them dismissed out of hand, as seems to have been the case to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this debate the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) touched on the crux of the matter: which is, as he said, that only 392 people are currently accessing farm household support. That tells its own story. Clearly, farm household support is not doing what the government intended it should do, and it needs to be amended. We seek to amend it by extending its availability and not making it such a one-way ticket off the farm for those who are dependent on it. We have also sought some changes to the re-establishment grant, because we feel there is a certain inflexibility in making the approximately $45,000 available to only one farming family, when in many instances the farm is managed by more than one farming family and some additional support is needed where additional families are being forced off the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to spend much longer dealing with the question of drought, but everyone agrees&mdash;government and opposition&mdash;that drought is a seasonal matter and that it is reasonable to expect farmers to farm in an Australian climate anticipating that a drought will arrive. For example, there has not been any effort by the coalition to suggest to the government that it ought currently to be intervening in the drought stricken state of South Australia, because this is the first year in which South Australia has found itself in drought. As a coalition, we have endeavoured to be realistic about the way in which drought policy is delivered, recognising that Australian farmers must expect to face drought from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, two difficulties. The first and more obvious one is that in the case of northern New South Wales and Queensland this is the fourth year of drought, so clearly any assistance is well and truly overdue. What is happening there, as both government and opposition recognise, is something that could not reasonably be budgeted for by anybody in any rural practice in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second difficulty is harder to come to terms with. I do not have an answer to it, but I feel I have a responsibility to alert the government to the fact that in the case of South Australia, particularly on the west coast, there are those who this year face a drought from which they will not be able to recover any grain at all. In technical terms it is their first year in drought. Their financial difficulties are compounded by the fact that last year they lost much of their grain due to a mouse plague that consumed paddocks of grain and seemed to be very difficult to contain, and the year before&mdash;irony of ironies&mdash;they lost their grain because it rained persistently through November and December and the grain was destroyed. They have only had one year of drought, but they have had an unpredictable three years of low, minimal or almost non-existent income in some instances. This is an instance where it may not be appropriate to deliver any form of drought relief, but some form of farm household support is entirely appropriate. It would be much better if that farm household support did not carry with it the automatic obligation to leave the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the government ought to be aware, as it considers its response to the drought, of instances where small businesses in rural Australia have experienced marginally better years, particularly over the last two years, and where a reasonable rainfall has, in some cases, meant sensible crops of oil seeds at tolerable prices. Those machinery dealers in regional Australia and, in some cases, those farmers will very likely face a provisional tax bill this year which they will be unable to meet simply because they will not have sufficient income. Therein lies a bind that the government ought to be conscious of as it puts together its rural policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some criticism levelled at farming generally by the member for Capricornia when she mentioned that one of the flow-on effects of drought is the erosion that occurs when large levels of rainfall follow a drought and soil is washed away. My experience with farming&mdash;which is now over 40 years&mdash;is that in almost all instances farmers are far more environmentally sensitive than ever they were. It is very rare for land to be cleared without good cause. In my own area of the mallee, where the rainfall may frequently be little more than nine inches, previous generations of farmers had an ongoing problem&mdash;it is a problem with which the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) would be familiar&mdash;where the encroachment of sandhills became a problem simply because land had been cleared and then began to drift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to the farming techniques of the 1990s, those problems have all but disappeared. Farmers who are now deliberating sowing drought tolerant crops, oats particularly, have been able to retrieve these sandhills. Far from drought causing additional soil erosion, although that is a possibility, the generation of farmers that we now represent as a parliament is a generation much less likely to get into trouble than their forefathers. Their forefathers simply lacked the techniques that are now in place to ensure that land erosion is a minimal problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by moving from the sublime to the ridiculous. We have been dealing with drought and I do not know quite how to link the rest of my remarks into my comments, except perhaps to refer to dry white wines, which is drawing a very long bow. Part of the legislation, as honourable members know, deals with the way in which a levy is to be collected from small winemakers and I want to pick up some of the comments made by the member for Mallee about the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious of the fact that the wine industry has committed itself to a dramatic expansion program encouraged by the federal government and in South Australia encouraged by the Dean Brown state government. I have no doubt that could be reflected by other state governments around Australia as well. It is expected that during the 1990s an additional 20,000 hectares of wine grapes will come into production and that the value of wine grape production will go from $1.5 billion in 1993 to, it is hoped, $2.5 billion by the year 2000. I am a little bothered about this level of expansion, having been around long enough to have watched every primary industry go through cycles and to know that there is only one road from being up, and that is running down. I do not mean that as any criticism of the present government's policy&mdash;I think that we are wisely encouraging the wine industry to expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is one cautionary word I want to exercise in the context of this debate. Following the government's decision to call for an inquiry into the wine industry, it has suggested to the wine industry that it would be prepared to allow a depreciation allowance for new plantings. This did not exist in the past but it exists now, so new plantings occurring in the wine industry can be effectively depreciated and there can be a tax advantage in that planting process. I approve of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out to the government, however, that the same sort of facility does not exist for the write-off in tree fruits and in dried vine fruits. I believe that currently we as a parliament, and the government particularly, are sending what is effectively the wrong signal to horticulturists and viticulturists around Australia, and it is placing a greater emphasis on wine grape expansion than is wise. The signal is, `We'll give you a tax write-off for this', but not a tax write-off for replacing, say, sultanas, currants, apricots, peaches, pears, normal market stone fruit or canning stone fruit production, or, for that matter, a write-off for citrus growers who may even, in the present climate, choose to expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that this is sending the wrong market signals and that we are having a greater emphasis placed on wine grapes than is wise, and the discerning growers may well choose to have a healthier mix of plantings if in fact the tax write-off were more evenly based. I would like to make that comment to the government and challenge it to pick up that particular call from the industry. I commend the amendment to the Main Committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I must try and do the same. I do not believe that the government could possibly consider supporting the amendment, for a number of reasons. The point has been made by speakers on the other side that the drought is not a new thing. Drought has been in Australia now, in some parts of it, for up to four years. Press coverage indicates that the government is going to make an announcement this afternoon, and also there is a fair exposure of what the statement is going to say. And what we find is that, after four years of drought in some areas, the representatives, as they claim, of country people get up and move an amendment like this a matter of hours before the government makes a major statement on the drought relief package that it is going to offer&mdash;and they expect us to take it seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is not putting down the drought or its effect. I would simply remind members opposite to have a look at the record of the state government in New South Wales and see how much it underspent its budget last year on rural assistance funding, and then see what it did to that component of its budget this year. They will find that not only did it underspend it last year by some $9 million, it immediately cut its budget this year by a similar amount, using the argument, `It was not spent last year so we do not need it this year.' That is the sort of thing that is happening on the other side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, let me get on with some of the important issues, some of the positive aspects of this legislation that is before us today. There are two parts of it that relate specifically to my electorate. One is the wine industry bill and the other one is the chicken industry bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we get on to those specifics, I had the good fortune, during the parliamentary recess in winter, to visit Japan, Korea and Taiwan. One of the things that we noticed there was that, because those countries are demanding high quality food imports, Australia is indeed one of the most highly regarded sources for fresh, clean food. That is the way it has to stay. That is why we must ensure that we are going to continue putting money into research and development to ensure that the quality of our produce is number one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, the chicken industry employs in the order of 2,000 people. The Steggles processing plant is just outside my electorate. It employs in excess of 500 people. There are many growers and supporting industries inside my electorate. Their major concern at present is the problem of imported chicken meat. Of course, the only way we are going to prevent imported chicken meat from coming into Australia is by ensuring that the standard that we have for our chicken meat is something that cannot be reproduced elsewhere, and that our consumers will not stand for less than the best that we can offer. It is also the best insurance we have to make sure that chicken exports from Australia can grow, because&mdash;as I have already mentioned&mdash;the Asian countries of Japan, Korea and Taiwan, with their imports of chicken meat, will demand only the best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill, because it means that that is the best way to safeguard the future of our chicken industry, and it is an extremely valuable industry. This bill's function is to monitor and assess the levels of chemical residues in raw plant and animal commodities, to give domestic and international consumers confidence in the quality and safety of those products, and to assist in identifying the causes and possible solutions of chemical residue problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is growing concern about chemical residues in food, as consumers expect a high standard of assurance about food safety and quality. I am sure that there is a great deal that we do not know about the effect of residues in foods that we eat. I am sure that at some time down the track we are going to expose some of the dangers that we have allowed ourselves to be exposed to simply because of the herbicides and the pesticides that we have used over a long period of time. I am fully supportive of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now go on to the parts of the legislation related to the wine industry. Before I do, I would like to read a few extracts from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> that was published on 19 September 1994. The article is headlined `Southcorp's Europe Strategy Rewarded'. It goes on to talk about an Australian wine's winning the most prestigious award in Britain for wine. Not only does this article talk about our going ahead and winning some of the `best in class' awards; it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The morning after the award ceremony of one of Britain's most prestigious wine competitions, David Combe is sitting in his office in Richmond, Surrey, barely able to conceal his delight at Southcorp Wines' triumph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Combe, Southcorp Wines' senior vice-president, international, admits he knew in advance that Penfolds Bin 707 stood a good chance of winning the International Wine Challenge's bordeaux-style category. But even he was surprised when it also won the competition's most coveted trophy, for the best red wine overall.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to talk about some of the wines that won their classes. There was a Henschke red, a Rosemount from the Hunter Valley, of course, a cabernet shiraz, and a Penfolds cabernet sauvignon that was tailor-made for the British market. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These awards demonstrate in absolute terms that by any criteria our quality is exceptional. It's not just a price-quality relationship.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the level that our wine industry has got to internationally, and that is why we have to ensure that this government does all it can to enable the wine industry to stay at that level. I would remind everyone that last year the world wine industry produced some three million litres of wine more than was consumed. Obviously, the big problem our wine industry faces is that, in a world where there is overproduction of wine, to get a place in a market there will be cost cutting. Again, our wine is being bought because it is the best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these two pieces of legislation are going to enhance that reputation. Firstly, there is the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill. The purpose of this bill is to revise the arrangements for levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act and to ensure that money will be spent on research and development for the wine grape industry. Sure, it will increase the maximum levy for research and development to $3 per tonne for grapes. But, if that extra dollar per tonne enhances our reputation as a premier winemaker, I think everyone in the industry and everyone outside the industry would agree that it is money well spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other section of the bill is about the method of collection and who the levy is collected from. No-one denies the fact that all wine grape growers effectively pay their levy now. If they do not crush their own grapes, they pay the fee to the organisation that is crushing their grapes for them, but they still pay it. Of course, it denies the small grape grower the right to participate in the decision making process of the wine industry, and to deny some of our boutique wine makers that right is a denial of natural justice, it is a denial of participating in the process of democracy. I support this change too because those small grape growers do understand, probably more than anyone else, the value of producing a wine for a niche market. They know how it is done. They simply do not have the capital or do not have the land to produce a large quantity of grapes and therefore support the capitalisation so that they have their own crushing, fermentation and bottling process. They should be allowed to participate in the decision making process of the wine industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to set the record straight with regard to drought, because I believe that there have been quite a number of incomplete and ignorant statements made this morning about drought, particularly severe drought, from which we are now suffering in Queensland and northern New South Wales. When the coalition government lost office in 1983&mdash;and that was after the 1982 drought, which in itself was a severe drought&mdash;the rural adjustment scheme was being provided with more money in real terms than it is now, and that was being made available to more people at the lower end of the financial spectrum in farming than what is now the case. There was no assets test on unemployment benefits or, if you like, jobstart and newstart. There was no assets test on Austudy, because it was recognised then, and still is by the coalition, that if the average value of a farm property or, for that matter, many unincorporated town businesses, is about $750,000, then people are effectively ruled out of any assistance by an assets test, even if they cannot sell the property&mdash;and that is the case now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm household support was there, and it was brought in by the coalition government in 1977, because even without an assets test, unemployment benefits did not provide a similar type of safety net for the self-employed sector of this country, as has always been the case for the salary and wage sector of this country. Drought was in the natural disaster scheme and IEDs, income equalisation deposits, were there, with a good incentive in their form to encourage people to put aside money in good years against bad years. That is very important for those areas where fodder is not an alternative, either because the farmers are grain growers or because they are low rainfall areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 there was a very severe drought. I will explain more about the difference between severe drought and ordinary drought in a minute. The fodder subsidy was brought in at that time. It was brought in to preserve the national herd and flock, which it did very successfully. It saved Australia billions of dollars in exports by maintaining wheat production or, if you like, grain production, wool production and meat production. In this one year, we are now looking at a loss of about $2 billion in exports because of the drought. If much of the sheep flock is killed or dies&mdash;and remember that once sheep are shorn in many parts of Australia, they will be shot, because there is not the money to continue to feed them&mdash;there will be a dramatic loss in income for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that there was some rorting of that fodder system. There is in every government system, but in the variety of reviews of that system that took place afterwards, I could quite clearly say that I have more evidence in my office each year of rorting of other government programs in my electorate, whether they be social security, jobs training, Aboriginal schemes, ethnic schemes, or whatever. It happens with all those schemes. We have to take that into context when we consider whether there should be a program or not. The fact that a program is not going to be administered perfectly is not a conclusive argument against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government came in in 1983 and changed just about everything that was in place to meet the next severe drought. Income equalisation deposits were virtually ruined, and three attempts by the Labor government to bring them back have not been successful. I think, in particular, of an announcement by the Labor government in one budget to improve the equalisation deposit scheme, but it was deferred for  12 months, so that woolgrowers who were then receiving a high price for their wool were prevented from investing in those deposits. For members of the government to criticise farmers for not putting aside money in good years for bad years, when they themselves have ruined what was in place to assist and encourage farmers to do so, is really very hypocritical, if not disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking again at the assets test at the moment. That was brought in by the government. It has fiddled with changes since, recognising that what it has done has been ideological and unfair. It is still not a realistic recognition of the capital formation needed by a non-incorporated business, farm or non-farm, to provide any sort of reasonable equity in welfare compared with the rest of our society. The fact is the member for Maranoa said that there are only 392 recipients of household support at this time when we have got parts of Queensland in their fourth year of drought and our wool growers are at one of their worst points ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning natural disasters and drought, a loaded committee was set up by this government some years ago to remove drought from the natural disaster relief scheme. There was a minority report, supported by the NFF representative, that severe drought should remain in the natural disaster arrangements. Remember: when we have natural disaster arrangements, there are agreements with the states on the range of measures which both the Commonwealth and the states are prepared to support. They could be on transport; they could be on fodder; they could be on water. They should recognise&mdash;and the policies we have had in place do recognise&mdash;that some forms of assistance are not as sensible with regard to environmental degradation as others. For example, it may be more sensible to provide a transport subsidy to get stock out rather than to bring fodder in. One has to be flexible with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing the Labor government has forgotten about altogether with regard to drought and natural disasters is that, under the natural disaster arrangements, not just farmers but town business people in those affected areas can receive assistance&mdash;up to $100,000 a year at four per cent interest. Therefore, the Labor government has, by its action, removed the main form of assistance for small businesses in towns affected by drought. The government has also fiddled around with investment allowances&mdash;sometimes in and sometimes out. It has therefore reduced the incentive and the ability for farmers in the higher rainfall areas, where it is sensible for them to have fodder, to have the necessary equipment. Once again, it is a disgrace that this government can accuse farmers of not preparing for drought when it has taken those things away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the next accusation, that somehow or other we have just come up with a drought policy, that is also wrong. I was the shadow minister for agriculture or primary industry for both the 1990 and 1993 elections. In both those election policies we had drought provisions and they are still policy. Those policies were supported by the NFF and are, to my knowledge, still supported by the NFF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to make a point about where we have moved with drought policy over the years since 1982. I am taking into account that committee which recognised the difference between severe drought and ordinary drought and recognised that there is an ability for farmers&mdash;or there should be an ability for farmers if they are given reasonable incentives&mdash;to cope with the dry year that happens every three to four years. I accept that is a natural part of farming. It should be able to be covered, provided there are reasonable incentive arrangements such as IEDs, et cetera. But look at our severe droughts&mdash;the droughts that occur every 10 to 15 years. I am talking here about southern Australia and the exact years may not relate to northern Australia. The years are 1944, 1957, 1967, 1982 and 1994. There is this recurring pattern of severe drought. It is impossible for anyone completely to cover themselves, particularly when they have had domestic cost price pressures and USA and EC export subsidies reducing prices abroad and there have been no IEDs in place to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are talking about drought, we are talking about two types of drought: the severe drought which has been in place for up to the fourth or fifth year in parts of southern Queensland, the Darling Downs and parts of northern New South Wales; as distinct from the failure of the winter rainfall in the winter rainfall areas of southern Australia as the drought moves further south. We should recognise a far greater need for those people who are now into their fourth year of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the states are providing a range of drought assistance measures at the present time, even though the natural disaster arrangements will not come in to assist them. Some of those measures include fodder subsidies, whether for transport or for fodder itself. There has been no criticism by this government of that action, and there has been no criticism by farmer organisations of that action. Yet, somehow or other, there is suddenly criticism of this addition by the coalition of a fodder subsidy to its current drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our drought policy is very clear. It has been in place, as I said, for some years. It is there in our election policy, and it remains policy. First of all, we return to worthwhile incentive based income equalisation deposit arrangements, which will give incentives to farmers to put money aside in better years. We have always recognised that, even when we move from no assets test whatsoever to assets tests, in cases of agriculture and the self-employed generally, there are situations where the assets test should not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our policy clearly states that, in severe situations such as wool price downturns, droughts, floods, et cetera&mdash;and whether it be for Austudy, for household support, for jobstart, or whatever&mdash;the assets test prevents food being put on the tables of people who, in some cases, are in their fourth year of drought and prevents children receiving adequate education. It really is a disgrace that there is a need in this country for well-meaning people&mdash;whom I commend&mdash;to send food parcels to the people so affected. It is a disgrace that they should have to do so because there is no safety net there&mdash;which there should be for every Australian in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At long last, the government is waking up; but it has taken it years to do so. The most educationally disadvantaged group in this country at the present time is the children on farm properties in those drought affected areas which are not close to a regional community where there is the necessary education so that they can attend every day. I hope that the government does keep catching up, because it has got a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also changed the rural adjustment scheme so that it no longer covers the lower end of at risk farmers. The scheme basically now is almost a second bank, and that is not what the rural adjustment scheme was put in place to be. There is a need to bring back investment incentives so that people can cover ordinary drought better. It is important that we have the essential elements of policy in place. If they are not in place, it is too late when they are finally brought in. There is no better evidence that it is too late now than that we are into the fourth year of drought in the Darling Downs and yet it is only now that something is going to be done, as I understand it, about the assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only changes and additions that the coalition has made&mdash;and they were announced by the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson)&mdash;to drought policy recently were, firstly, better recognition of farm workers, who of course are also hurt in times of drought, and, secondly, in times of severe drought, a fodder subsidy. A fodder subsidy is a very sensible thing to propose, because of the question of its impact on the future earning capacity of this country. In particular, we are looking at two very big industries being at risk. The first is wool: there are going to be millions of sheep shot, or dying once they are shorn, unless rain comes&mdash;because farmers cannot afford to keep feeding them. The second is the beef feedlot industry, which has been remarkably successful. In big dollar terms, it is probably the most successful value adding industry in Australia in the way it has improved. Perhaps the dairy industry might match it. It is certainly ahead of the wine industry at this stage, but it is at risk in the Japanese and other markets, because of the price of grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in talking about the price of grain going up if we had a subsidy scheme; the price of grain has doubled now. There is, however, an outer parameter to the price of grain, which is the import parity price of grain. That would still apply if there were a scheme in place. The import parity price is approximately $220 a tonne. It is perhaps possible to land it for about $180 or $190, but then there is the question of transport, and there are also some problems with quarantine with certain situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial reaction of the National Farmers Federation was only to the fodder subsidy; it did not react to all of other elements of the policy that the honourable member for Gwydir announced. It forgot that the real question of price for grain in a drought is the import parity price of grain because there is basically no fodder or hay left in Australia now and there will not be any with the failure of the winter rainfall areas in the south. It forgot that it had already supported the other elements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the federation has read the policy&mdash;and it has admitted that it had not read the policy&mdash;there is pressure from its own state organisations, and from commodity groups, which are all telling the Canberra section of the National Farmers Federation what they think of that initial reaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to what is a terrible situation in this country. We are one of the most affluent countries in the world but good meaning people have had to prepare food parcels to be sent to help other people in this country because this government removed the safety net that would have allowed them to put groceries on the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this drought continues&mdash;and I hope it does not continue&mdash;this government is going to be forced to adopt more and more the policy that we have had in place for years, whether it likes it or not. Today's announcement will certainly be incorporating some of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to refer to one of the other bills, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill. Grapes, together with other forms of irrigated horticulture, provide one of the major seasonal labour sources in this country. My area has more deciduous fruit and tomatoes than grapes but the Sunraysia area has grapes for both dried vine fruit and wine. There are about 15,000 to 20,000 people employed for about three months early in the calendar year, of which about 10,000 come in from other areas. It is a unique and genuine job creation situation each year. It is very valuable with regard to exports, import replacement and value adding. Particularly for the young people&mdash;the more physically fit people&mdash;it is valuable work experience and it takes them away from that mentality of unemployment benefit or jobstart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately&mdash;and I genuinely say unfortunately&mdash;the government's policy, as announced in its white paper, concentrates on the long-term unemployed and this will actually work against finding jobs or placing young people in jobs in irrigated areas where there is a very large seasonal demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year, the Commonwealth Employment Service in the Shepparton and the Goulburn Valley area in my electorate goes on a tour of about a dozen CES offices in New South Wales and Victoria. These CES officers, together with fruit grower representatives who pay their own way, explain to the CES people in those other places the type of labour that is required and when it will be required. They advise them to stay in touch because weather can change the time the fruit is picked. My office traditionally has stayed open over that early New Year period because of problems with people coming in. That money will not be available any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are only talking about a few thousand dollars as against the hundreds of millions of dollars for these other schemes which do not provide the genuine jobs that this scheme provides. I ask the government to look again at this unintended consequence of its policy. This is a sensible arrangement whereby industry and the Commonwealth Employment Service work together to find people for those many thousands of jobs. These jobs give people the valuable experience of genuine jobs and the arrangement benefits both sides. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will deal now with the amendment moved by the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). I see that as merely a means for members of the opposition to be able to talk about drought, and I suppose that is fair enough. But if they are fair dinkum and if they want to push that, let them take it down to the other house and let us have a debate down there, by which time our package will be out. I put that challenge to the member for Maranoa and others: cut out the rubbish that you are carrying on with and say to us, `We will put this to a vote in the other house', because to me, that is simply a means of your being about to do a bit of squawking up here&mdash;particularly the member for Maranoa. I noted that in his speech he spent a lot of time talking about the chicken industry, and he certainly had a long squawk after that, but on the drought issues he sounded a bit like a dead chook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue really is about policy and we have heard a number of references to policy. The member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), interjecting on the member for Richmond (Mr Newell),  said, `Oh, we have had that policy for a long time.' Our problem over this side is that we really do not know what your policy is. We have had Fightback, we have had the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) changing policy on the run, and actually saying that he is not going to release any details of any policy, so you can understand our confusion about where you stand on a lot of areas. Nonetheless, it is good to have you standing up and saying that this is your policy on drought. But we are confused, absolutely confused, about your position on a lot of issues. It seems to me that the opposition, to a great extent, has not got that rigorous approach to policy that enables it to bring out that sort of defined policy that is well constructed and targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by many recently, particularly in the press, that a good opposition is necessary, and I think that nowhere more than in policy issues is that essential. I have got to say that I am confused about where you stand on a whole range of issues. I would like to know&mdash;and that is a genuine comment&mdash;where the opposition stands on a whole range of issues . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa also attacked the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for visiting drought stricken areas. He said it was late. I think the real problem that members opposite see there is that the visit was so welcomed, and it was. It is not drawing a long bow at all to say that the Newspoll polling in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, which was taken in the days directly after that visit to outback Australia, showed such a marked swing towards the Prime Minister. I think that he is very well accepted in the bush, and the policy statements he makes are well constructed. He showed genuine concern, as we all do on this side, and I am confident that, with the Prime Minister's support, we are going to have a good package for country Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, bearing in mind that you attack him for visiting the bush, I think there is a real fear of him being out there. If we look at the most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> poll, for instance, we see that he is the preferred Prime Minister in rural Australia. That puts a real scare into some of the people opposite. They do not like to see him out in rural Australia, and they doubletalk it around and say, `He should have been here sooner' or `He should come more often', but the reality is that members opposite do not like him being there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that is understandable, because the National Party mostly does not like him being there. I also get that feeling up my way or when I go to other areas, but we will keep coming. The Prime Minister will keep doing the trips and we will keep bringing out good, rigorous, well-constructed policy for country Australia. I note many of the comments coming from the people who met the Prime Minister on his recent tour, and members opposite also will see that country Australia is already recognising the value of having a government that can put together good policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be opposing this amendment for obvious reasons.

Evidence for this is a certificate provided by the commercial finance institution to the Department of Social Security and indicating that the farmer is unable to access further commercial loans. Once that inability to obtain finance is established, Social Security will apply an income and assets test. The assets test excludes farm assets, which are broadly defined as any assets essential to the running of the farm. Life insurance and superannuation held by the farmer are also excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two groups of farmers who benefit from the scheme. There are those who believe they have a future in the industry but are unable to obtain further commercial financial support, and there are also those who have decided to leave farming but require support while they arrange the sale of the property. The first group can receive finance to meet the family's daily living expenses whilst remaining on the property and working to put the business back onto a firm footing. There are no repayments required until the family comes off the scheme, with scope to repay over five or 10 years. Farmers in the second group who sell their property within nine months will receive a payment equivalent to the balance of the farm household support they would have received had they remained on the land for the full nine-months grant period. These are worthwhile initiatives, but I have heard a number of complaints about the scheme's administration, so I welcome amendments made to allow for immediate delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains measures to amend the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to allow fishing permit holders greater flexibility in nominating which boat is to be used with that permit. Although few of the hundreds of fishermen in my area fish in Commonwealth territorial waters, I know that replacing vessels is often stifled by red tape and that fishermen would welcome any moves to reduce the bureaucratic difficulties involved. Arrangements to enable funds collected from the cattle industry to be used for target testing programs and for education extension programs to be aimed at reducing contamination on farms will result from amendments to the National Residue Survey Act 1992, while proposed amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act are aimed at eradicating an anomaly in funding arrangements for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the definition of the sugar industry organisations in section 4(1) of the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987. This amendment has become necessary because of the consolidation of sugar industry organisations. The new organisations have been prescribed for the purposes of the definition. A small drafting error in the Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993, on which I had the pleasure of speaking earlier, has required a slight amendment. Similarly, the wording of the Wool Tax Act (No. 3) 1964 has now become redundant, since wool dealers are now required to be registered, which fact means that the term `registered wool dealer' is anachronistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill further amends the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 to extend the definition of grain. This is to allow seed testing and certification of a greater range of seed species. Improvements in the allocation of levy payments to equity holders in the wheat industry fund will result from minor changes to the Wheat Marketing Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to also talk about the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill is intended to allow for an increase from the present 0.02c a head to 0.06c a head on the levy rate payable for the national residue survey. The move is aimed at increasing consumer protection and further ensuring that Australia's meat chicken producers retain their clean and green image, domestically and internationally. It is also in line with the government's clean food export strategy; and that strategy is another example of policies which are there to develop commercial linkages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is designed to enhance Australia's image as a supplier of clean, fresh, quality produce in overseas markets. It is based on creating a market advantage for Australian fresh and processed food on the basis of its quality and origin from a clean environment. The program is a joint initiative with industry and government funding and is conditional upon matching industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is working with industry to ensure that the clean food export strategy has the backing of necessary quality assurance programs, and the amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chicken) Amendment Bill 1994 will allow for increases in the charges for inspection through changes to the regulations rather than legislation. I would not expect the rate to increase markedly over either the short or medium term. Since 1991 the value of chicken exports from Australia has more than doubled, making the protection of our `clean supplier' tag an important ingredient in continuing growth in this export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 affects the components of the wine grapes levy. Producers of small quantities of grapes will now pay a flat fee as the marketing component of the levy. This is not unreasonable if these producers are gaining commercially from the generic promotion of wines elsewhere. They will also gain the right to attend, debate and vote at annual meetings of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also consideration of amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994. These amendments follow the amendments to the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill in that they change the definition of a producer to include those who produce less than 10 tonnes of wine grapes. They also make the definition of a producer clearer in terms of who is the owner of the wine. Under current legislation a grape producer can have his or her grapes turned into wine by a processor and then returned to him or her for sale. The legislation deems that the processor is the owner of the wine, when clearly that is not so. The amendment will address this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, I believe this is an appropriate way to deal with non-contentious legislation. We have had ample opportunity to examine the contents of the bills and to raise any concerns we may have about them. I commend the bills to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to say something about some of the comments made previously about communities coming together to support those in drought areas. We have heard the opposition attack the farmhand appeal, and we have heard the opposition attack the measures being taken by communities to help those in need in rural Australia. In my own electorate last weekend the community got together and loaded seven full semitrailers of hay to go to western areas. There was help there from the army to do that, with army trucks. Last night there was a concert in Grafton to raise money for rural areas. I think that is admirable. I think it is a wonderful exhibition of the community coming together and helping their fellow Australians, and I have got nothing but praise for all those people involved. I certainly commend the Grafton, Lower Clarence and north coast people who have been involved with that, including the Rotary clubs that organised it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is playing its part in the farmhand appeal, matching that dollar for dollar. Later this evening there will be an announcement of the drought package of extra assistance. That recognises that this is no ordinary drought, that in many areas it has been going on for quite a number of years and that the present policies, whilst having the right direction, perhaps have settings that cannot handle the present severe, extreme and long-lasting drought. Those people out in the areas of rural Australia that are affected by drought can rest confident that the federal Labor government will do everything in its power to bring in well constructed, targeted policies that will assist them through this very difficult period. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other chamber we are talking about whether or not university students pay $100. It is really earth-shattering stuff that is going on in the House, really important stuff. I cannot help but comment upon the fact that I served on university councils to which I was elected on a number of occasions. I remember a debate of 2 1/2 hours on one occasion as to whether we should pay 4c or 2c deposit on soft drink bottles. On another occasion we debated for three days the issue of one vote, one value. The relevant motion had been moved by a chap who was elected as a vice-president by 200 votes when there were some 1,000 electors putting somebody else up. So I reflect upon the relative importance placed upon the farmers in this country in view of the stupidity and frivolous legislation being passed in the House. It gives a clear indication of the thinking of the federal government with respect to farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put the matter into perspective for the few of us who are here listening, although I note that we do circulate some of our speeches so there will be a large number of people at least reading what I have to say. One of my very best friends has left his station property to go working as a clerk, leaving his wife at home so that he can hold on to the station property. His brother has gone to work as a plant operator so his family are by themselves. Where we had property until recently, my neighbour, a very fine young man, worked for six months navvying in the railway, away from home, with his wife and three kids left by themselves, 200 kilometres to the nearest town. Not surprisingly, that very successful marriage collapsed as a result of the brutality forced upon him by the systems that exist in Australia. I will have more words to say about that further down the track. My good friend told me that his neighbour is away selling Amway. That is how he is holding on to his station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you go into the station homesteads these days, it is amazing because there is nothing on the walls. There is not a print or even a picture on the walls; there are not even any family photographs in frames anywhere. It is depressing beyond belief. The last time I visited a station I sat on a wooden stool because there was literally no furniture in the house. I am not saying that five or maybe seven per cent of people out there are not doing reasonably well and not living in these sort of conditions but there is a very large proportion&mdash;and I am saying 20 per cent&mdash;that are living in homes without anything on the walls whatsoever&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An absolutely grinding poverty. In the state of Queensland since the socialist government won the election, if you worked as a railway worker in Julia Creek or you had a small holding outside Julia Creek, seventh, eighth and up to ninth grade schooling was available for your children in Julia Creek. That school has been closed, so if you want a secondary education beyond seventh grade, you have to send your kids away to a boarding school. The cost of the very reasonable and very excellent boarding schools in Charters Towers, which educate most of our children in north Queensland in this situation, is about $8,000 to $9,000. The maximum amount of government assistance, it appears to me, and I am informed, that people can get is about $5,000. There is no way that people who have an average income of minus $24,000 are going to be able to put $8,000 away to enable their children to get an education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the very few advanced countries in the world where a large sector of the population now has no secondary education available to it. We are not talking about tertiary education. We are not talking about whether we pay an extra $200 a year for student fees, as with the frivolity in the other place; we are talking about basic secondary education. I do not know how many doors are left open&mdash;very few, I suspect&mdash;in our society today to people who have only a seventh grade education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will shortly come to why grinding poverty and oppression has been imposed by this government. It has not been something that is the result of the natural interplay of market forces or of natural conditions such as drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we had a little piece of land, I think there were 10 of us, but there are now only two station owners left&mdash;possibly three&mdash;and one of those stations is on the market. I suspect another one will go on the market shortly. They have been sold up by the banks. When these people leave the stations, it is not like losing a job, because they still have some sort of income. It is not a very good income but they leave with an income called unemployment benefits. When a station owner is booted off his station he takes with him maybe $50,000 or $100,000 or $200,000 in debt. So he takes bankruptcy, which is pretty damn unpleasant, or wears that debt for the rest of his days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that some of the people in that situation&mdash;particularly the sheep farmers now that sheep prices are coming back&mdash;are being pushed out a window and taking the tax debt with them. Even if they take bankruptcy, they must still pay off the tax debt. That is the degree of oppression and human misery that is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last two years in the tiny area which was my old state electorate we have had five suicides. One of them had been the local president and, if my memory serves me correctly, an ex state president of the Cattlemens Union. He had the unenviable task of shooting 100 of his little steers which he did not have the money to keep alive. He shot them to at least enable his cows to survive. In even reasonably ordinary times he would have been able to buy fodder or at least supplementary feed that would have enabled the cows and the calves to survive. In this case, probably half the cows will be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banks were also bearing down upon him, I would imagine. In the depths of his human misery, after four generations of hard work and sacrifice and after watching every single thing that was built by that hard work and sacrifice being lost to him, and knowing that he could not pass on the same advantages that he had enjoyed to his children, he took the ultimate and terrible solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was only one of five. A combination of stresses imposed by the regime of oppression that has come down on these people as they lose their jobs and feel the hopelessness of never being able to get a job was the cause, in my opinion, of those five suicides. Those are the suicides that I know of. I am not in a position to know of all the suicides that occur in that area any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not bothered to talk very much in party circles or even in public about these drought relief measures because they are so frivolous and ridiculous. The farmers are going to get nine months of social welfare benefit and that is only if they leave. So what we are actually doing is forcing people to leave the land. That is the solution of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with deep pain and regret that I say that I do not understand how any of the farmers in Australia have a body representing them called the NFF. I do not understand how its director last year said that one in three farmers had to go. As Julian McGauran, a senator I am very proud of in the National Party, said: `Who are you? Are you the PR officer for the banks? You are the spokesman for the liquidators, are you?' The NFF director has not recanted or apologised. That was the position he took, and then the same people had the temerity to attack proposals being put up by us&mdash;and I thought they would have applauded any assistance. I will bet London to a brick that they applaud the proposals that come forward this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to ask questions about these people. If they take money to do a job and sell out the people that they are supposed to be doing the job for&mdash;and I would add to this the actions of the NFF on the issue of Mabo&mdash;all I can say is that there is a name to describe them, which I am not going to use. Other people who are listening and are conscious of what we are saying here today can put that name on people who take someone's money and then sell them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn from the emotional side of this&mdash;I do not think we can understand it unless we can see the emotional side of it&mdash;to the hard statistical evidence that is out there. There have been four reports, and each of them has been a very fine, professionally prepared report. One report was done by the Queensland Farmers Federation. Another report was commissioned by the ABC and other people at Longreach. I pay very great tribute to them. A report was done by the UGA. John Wilson was the author of that report and he is an excellent person. A very brilliant report was done by Peter Newman of the DPI Arid Research Centre at Longreach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those reports all confirm, reconfirm and reinforce in one's mind the situation&mdash;I am specifically referring to Peter Newman's report&mdash;that more than half of the farmers of inland Queensland owe in excess of $500,000. Their projected income for the forthcoming year is minus $24,000. We are now talking about providing them with unemployment benefits for nine months, if they will run away with their tails between their legs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these people came to the most barren land on earth. The first three exploration parties to the north were wiped out to a man. Kennedy's party was wiped out with only one survivor, Jackey Jackey. Burke and Wills were wiped out&mdash;there were no survivors out of those who had continued into Northern Australia&mdash;and Leichhardt's party vanished without a trace. They were the first three attempts by Europeans to venture into this land, and yet the farmers of inland Queensland have turned the land into some of the most productive parts of the planet. That is what these people have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I never cease to have immense pride in reflecting upon the fact that if I had driven across my old electorate from Cloncurry to Hughenden 100 years ago, I would not have seen a single goanna, or kangaroo, or emu, or anything. There were no human beings; nothing. The land was completely barren because there was no surface water. Today there are an estimated two million kangaroos in that area. There are people in the area who are producing maybe $300 million a year in export earnings for this country. The thanks that these people are getting from their country is in the form of handouts&mdash;toothbrushes and food parcels. Heaven only knows that what the people in the cities are doing is a wonderful thing; but how humiliating, how degrading!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have a look at a race of people who have been reduced to mendicants. Go to the Todd River in Alice Springs and have a look at what handing out taxpayers' money does to an individual and what it has done to five individuals whom I knew in my electorate. They were all people whom I knew well, but they are now dead. They chose to shoot themselves rather than to continue in the pain and misery in which they worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is to blame for this? When I buried my father, I gave a lot of thought to what I would say. People probably give more intense thought to what they will say at their father's funeral than they would give to many other things in their life. Many wonderful things have happened for people in Queensland&mdash;for example, the coal that has been mined, the dams that have been built and the artesian bores. The most important thing that happened to the people who live in inland Australia was the minimum price scheme for wool. For the first time in our history we could have some sort of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked with hungry eyes at the sugar industry. I am pleased that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) is here because he will back me up in saying what a wonderful industry the people within that industry achieved with their statutory marketing. They built the most magnificent and secure industry of probably any that we have in Australia. When the wool industry got statutory marketing in a very mild form, for the first time in our history we went through two decades of stable reasonable prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Senator Ron Boswell, in a very brilliant speech in the Senate, the week before Mr Kerin's infamous press conference&mdash;and I do not blame him, he was forced to do it by the former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;we were selling 80 per cent of our wool and we were selling it at 890c a kilo. The week after Mr Kerin's press conference, we were selling arguably only 20 per cent, most certainly not more than 30 per cent of the wool clip, and we were selling it at the minimum price of 870c a kilo. Of course, the government ultimately abolished the wool marketing scheme. All right, people can ride the laissez-faire capitalist system; they can ride the roller-coaster; but they can just hope and pray that when the price is down they do not get hit with a drought. It is goodbye time for them if they do. We can ride the droughts. Give us a reasonably stable price and we will ride the droughts. We have weathered 100 droughts in the last 100 years&mdash;20 or 30 huge droughts, anyway, in that period of time. We can do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At times we can even weather interest rates of 10 and 15 per cent&mdash;a regime that does not exist anywhere else in the world for farmers. But we cannot stand up to a regime of 25 per cent. In fact, I do not need anyone to tell me what farmers are paying in interest rates. In our last year on St Francis station we paid, with bank charges, 29 per cent interest rates. Even at 25 per cent, debt is doubling every 3 1/2 years. When we went into our seventh year of debt, for people who had started with a mild debt of $100,000, that doubled and doubled again. Then they are up to the half million dollar mark, which is exactly the figure quoted in all of those things&mdash;and I think that $100,000 in debt would have been a fairly average figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could anyone impose a regime of 25 per cent interest rates and expect businessmen of any ilk to be standing upright? Our bankruptcies roared away from 4,500 a year when the ALP government was elected to 16,000 a year by 1990-91. Now for every bankruptcy that occurs there are maybe 10 or 20 people who go broke. In fact, I only know one person who has taken technical bankruptcy, but I know hundreds, maybe even thousands if I were pressed, who have gone broke and lost everything. They have lost more than everything; they have walked away with a huge debt on their shoulders. For the rest of their lives they will have to try to pay off a debt of $100,000 or something of that nature. What the government can and should be doing is what every government in Australian history has done. The government can borrow money. The bond rate is six or seven per cent. It can borrow money at six or seven per cent. Please, why can it not borrow that money at six or seven per cent and parcel it out to the farmers at six or seven per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were special help banks. There was the Commonwealth Development Bank which has been commercialised and abolished as a special help bank; there was the Agricultural Bank in Queensland which has been abolished as a special help bank; there was the Primary Industry Bank of Australia, PIBA, which was established as a special help bank, which has been commercialised. There is no special assistance available this time. For the first time in Australian history&mdash;in this century, anyway, as far as people's memories can go back&mdash;the farmers have had to face a situation where there is no special help bank out there. They just had to wear the 25 per cent interest rates or fall over dead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said, `We have been generous to you, we have given you $100 million.' What absolute rubbish! It has not given $100 million to the farmers. That money goes to the banks&mdash;that is where the money is going&mdash;because the banks are borrowing at five and six per cent and are loaning that money out at 10, 11 and 11 1/2 per cent. That is what is happening. And that money is going to pay the ridiculous margin. No banking group anywhere else in the world is enjoying the margins enjoyed by the Australian banks at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answers are out there at the present moment. Heaven only knows that if we had some sort of formula by which write-offs could occur then the banks would be very reasonable in many cases in allowing those write-offs to occur. During the Great Depression, the farming sector was not in as much trouble as it is now. Interestingly, there were only two years in which the farming sector was worse off than it is now&mdash;in terms of both the number of people in trouble and commodity prices. At the end of those two years, the banks sold the debt for 30 per cent discounts. The answers are there. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Fire Authorities Council has not yet confirmed its willingness to support the development of the standardisation of standpipes and couplings to either my department or to Standards Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Standards Australia raised a project on standard connections for firefighting equipment in May 1990 with the intention of establishing a single system throughout Australia. Standards Australia has indicated to my Department that it does not have the in-house expertise to develop a standard on standpipes and couplings and is reliant on input from committee members. Consequently, if the committee members do not support the project, little headway can be made. Standards Australia would be willing to reopen the project if the major user, the Australian Fire Authorities Council indicated their willingness not only to develop such a coupling, but to implement phased transfer of all equipment such that the standard coupling could be utilised.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessional treatment of goods accompanying travellers arriving in Australia is governed by the terms of Customs by-laws made under the Customs Tariff Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These provisions relating to passenger concessions have been in place since 1987, following an inquiry by the former Industries Assistance Commission (IAC).
