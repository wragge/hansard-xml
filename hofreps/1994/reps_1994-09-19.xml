<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes that in 1991 the Parliament of the Commonwealth unanimously enacted the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act 1991 to promote a process of reconciliation between the indigenous and wider Australian communities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)supports the concept of constructive reconciliation between the indigenous and wider Australian communities;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)in acknowledgment of this support, adopts the vision of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, namely, `a united Australia which represents this land of ours; values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage; and provides justice and equity for all' as a vision shared by this Chamber; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)invites Members and Senators of the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia to establish an organisation to advance the reconciliation process to be called Australian Parliamentarians for Aboriginal Reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion today in an effort to seek to bring some balance back into the debate about the future of Aboriginal people in this country and the process of reconciliation. At the moment, the House is in the middle of a fairly intense debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. During the last sitting week when we were debating some of the clauses of that bill it was unfortunate that at times the debate became a bit acrimonious and words were used that were not particularly appropriate. Unfortunately, the debate tended to break down into a political fight between members of the government and members of the opposition. It was a great tragedy that debate on an issue as important as the future welfare of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the land acquisition fund, which is supported by the government and I understand by the opposition, broke down and resulted in such a level of acrimony. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would like to talk about the vision of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, why it is an important vision and why this parliament and all its members should share that vision and commit themselves to it. This motion is being seconded by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), a member of the opposition, and I understand that opposition members will be supporting it. The important message to go to both the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people of this country is that the principle of Aboriginal reconciliation is supported by both sides of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 I had the great privilege to participate in the debate when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation legislation was adopted unanimously by this chamber and by the Senate. The debate was very positive and the government and the opposition can be proud of this significant bipartisan achievement for this House. It was the first time in eight years that this chamber had seen unanimous support for legislation affecting Aboriginal affairs. Until that point there had been a lot of bitterness and a lot of division within this parliament about what should occur in regard to Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 a commitment was made by the then shadow minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), and the opposition to the concept of Aboriginal reconciliation. Those opposite worked closely with the government to achieve a structure that addressed their concerns as well as the principles of Aboriginal reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then we have had a number of other political debates and a number of other issues, the most important of which was the decision of the High Court in Mabo and the government's response to that decision. The legislation that was introduced occasioned very bitter debate both in the broader Australian community and, at times, in this parliament. Unfortunately, the next stage of that debate&mdash;the land acquisition fund&mdash;has also seen us go down that path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are genuine people on both sides of this parliament with deep felt convictions who have a sincere desire to achieve the best outcome for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. I do not think there is any argument that people on both sides of this parliament are committed to a better outcome and a better future for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Where we tend to disagree at times is on the processes required to achieve that better outcome. That is the essence of the debate about the land acquisition fund. The argument concerns the best process to achieve those improved outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want anyone to think that we on this side of the House have a monopoly on goodwill towards Aboriginals or that we are the only ones who are truly committed to Aboriginal people. I know that there are many people on the other side of this House who are similarly committed. I have worked with them closely as a member of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and in other forums. I understand their strongly held commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation is a reflection of the spirit of goodwill that exists across the whole Australian community because it has as members people from all sectors. The honourable member for Aston has been a strong spokesperson on Aboriginal issues in this parliament and is the opposition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about today is the vision that the council has adopted. When it was first established, the council had to try to explain to the people of Australia what was meant by the term `reconciliation' because the whole concept of the council originated from people starting to talk about the need for a treaty, the need for some form of document wherein the non-Aboriginal Australians negotiated with Aboriginal Australians for their occupation of this land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone far beyond that, to a point where we are now trying to reconcile a whole range of differences. Commissioner Elliott Johnston from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody summed up the challenge very aptly in chapter 38 of the report of the royal commission, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that great patience is required, especially on the non-Aboriginal side. It is the non-Aboriginal society that created the division and sustained it over a long period of time; we cannot expect the Aboriginal people to respond quickly. The non-Aboriginal society and culture is evolving and changing and the Aboriginal people must be allowed to develop their own culture in their own ways; clearly there is scope for the two to interact in a fruitful and mutually fulfilling way. The process may falter at times; appear to get lost; but it can be pulled up again and survive if we are cool and negotiate with open minds and as with equals. And in the end, perhaps together, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, the situation can be reached where this ancient, subtly creative Aboriginal culture exists in friendship alongside the non-Aboriginal culture. Such an achievement would be a matter of pride not only for all Australians but for all humankind.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the challenge that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation has set for us all. That is the challenge in which this motion is seeking to involve this House. Unfortunately, since the formation of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, we have gone off the track and we have lost that vision. We have tended to be bogged down in political arguments about processes rather than returning to the essential essence of the argument, which is to try to bring together those two important cultures, the non-Aboriginal culture and the Aboriginal culture, so that we as a society are walking together, as the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation so aptly titles its magazine. That is an important and essential element of the council. The vision seeks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a united Australia which respects this land of ours; values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage; and provides justice and equity for all . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a commendable vision which I hope this House will adopt. I know that many people on both sides of this House will be prepared to work together to help the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to achieve that vision. When we establish the Australian Parliamentarians for Aboriginal Reconciliation, I hope that I will be able to say to this House after some months that we have a very broad representation of members from both sides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, Mr Speaker. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), mentioned, I am the coalition's representative on the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. I acknowledge that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), has given me the opportunity to be the first member on our side to speak in this debate on the motion of the honourable member for Moreton.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, when the council was formed about 2 1/2 to three years ago, there were 25 of us at our first meeting&mdash;12 indigenous Australians, two people from the Torres Strait and 11 people from the broader community. Amongst those people from the broader community were many well-known names, including Ian Spicer from the business community, Jennie George from the ACTU, Ray Martin from television, Robert Champion de Crespigny from the mining industry and Rick Farley from the farming community. There was also a wide range of well-known and respected indigenous people who may not be as well known across the broader community but who are well known amongst their own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that first meeting, we spent many hours trying to come up with our vision because it was important that it was right. We went through a process of iteration, but we then came up with a vision and a number of key issues. The vision of a united Australia is the key to what the council and reconciliation are all about. We want a united Australia; we do not want a country that is divided, regardless of whether it is between indigenous and non-indigenous people or in any other way. We all share this land and therefore we all have to respect it. It is not my land or your land; it is our land&mdash;and that includes the indigenous people. We have to value the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were here many tens of thousands of years before the Europeans came here. It is a valuable heritage that these days is beginning to be accepted by most people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we have noted in our vision that we need to provide justice and equity for all. It is important to note the words `justice' and `equity'. All too often when we are talking about indigenous disadvantage&mdash;whether it be shortened life expectancy, over-representation in gaols or poor health, housing and education&mdash;we want not only equity for indigenous people in all of those matters as of right but also justice. That justice should exist not only in terms of their treatment in the court system, gaols and so on but also in terms of the dispossession of their land. So it is a very important vision that has tried to encompass all the aspects that are critical to the role that the council has undertaken in a 10-year time span. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first council membership was appointed for three years, and that three years is very nearly up. In fact, on 17 November, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will be presenting its report to the Presiding Officers&mdash;to you, Mr Speaker and to the President of the Senate&mdash;in the Great Hall, giving an account of its stewardship for the first three years and detailing the many things it has undertaken to bring about reconciliation in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that we have had some major challenges along the way. From my perspective, the Mabo debate was not helpful in bringing about reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. It was a very divisive debate. But it was obviously a very fundamental decision from the High Court&mdash;something that was very important to indigenous people and something with which the broad community is coming to terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining community, which was very anti the native title legislation at the time, has accepted that it needed to take a different position and it now supports the legislation. The farming community has also accepted the legislation. Although it caused some division across the broad community, we have overcome the major hurdle and are moving along on a number of other fronts. It is worth noting that in private industry there are a number of examples of private companies going out of their way to ensure provision of the lifeblood of Aboriginal development&mdash;jobs and businesses. At a meeting of the council that I attended last week in Adelaide a number of such examples were given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have also been a number of interesting examples coming from local government to show that reconciliation is clearly becoming a very serious topic. For example, the Lord Mayor of Newcastle and his council have come up with a declaration acknowledging the very important contribution that Aboriginal people make in that part of the country and stating their willingness to work with them. Bunbury in Western Australia has done exactly the same thing within the last two or three weeks. The Ti Tree Council in the Northern Territory&mdash;a white council&mdash;went to the local Aboriginal council and suggested that they merge and operate as a single council for that part of the country. Those sorts of steps are very important in achieving Aboriginal reconciliation with the broader community. But they need to be repeated across the country, time after time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, many times the police are held to be the problem when it comes to getting on with the indigenous people. But there are some good stories. For example, recently at Ballina in New South Wales there was a situation where the local police and the Aboriginal community got together. Now, when somebody from the indigenous community gets into trouble, that person is not just locked up willy-nilly. The local community is contacted, someone comes along and the community takes care of its own. That means that Aboriginal people are not being locked up for quite minor offences, and that, of course, prevents deaths in custody and so on, flow-ons likely to result from imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early in the life of the council I was lucky to have the opportunity to make a small contribution when we had a meeting here in Canberra. We met with the Aboriginal community on the Friday night and heard about some of the problems with the police in Queanbeyan. There are three federal parliamentarians on the Aboriginal Reconciliation Council&mdash;Senator Margaret Reynolds from the government, Senator Cheryl Kernot from the Democrats and me. The three of us went to Queanbeyan and talked with the police and the local indigenous population and arranged for them to have meetings every two or three weeks, not on particular issues but to make sure that communication was kept going and that any problems were forestalled. It seems to me that those are the sorts of things that help the process very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in places such as Cape York in Queensland, which are often seen as hotbeds of racism and other problems&mdash;and they often are&mdash;there are cattlemen who are actively involved in helping indigenous people run their own cattle stations. In the mining industry, we have had the setting up of an organisation called J-Calm recently. Twelve managing directors of the biggest mining companies in the country and the leaders of the Aboriginal communities where they want to do the mining have, for the first time, sat down together and started to talk about their problems rather than negotiate via brickbats in the media. It seems to me that those sorts of steps are very positive. We have had similar activity in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The trade union movement has become actively involved. There has been a lot of activity in the media. People have been talking to media operators, editors and reporters and taking reporters out to some remote Aboriginal communities and letting them see the situation on the ground. Reporters need to talk not only to the Aboriginal communities but also to the non-Aboriginal communities and get both perspectives so that when the headlines come up they are not headlines that give a totally false impression or just the bad news. They will also be able to write articles that are balanced, sensible and reasonable so that we do not stir up hysteria in the broader population and we have a very informed debate on the various issues. We will not always agree, but it is important that we deal with the facts rather than emotion. There has been a massive program of consultation with indigenous communities to get their input as to what ought to happen with the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have also set up an organisation called Australians for Reconciliation. Across the land, in community after community, small groups of people who want to be associated with the reconciliation process are setting themselves up to be known as Australians for Reconciliation. They will foster reconciliation in their local community. I could go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that I perceive the start of a sea change in attitude in this country. Irrespective of whether one agrees with some of the details of the issues, public awareness about the plight of indigenous people and the disadvantaged is much greater. There is a desire to see those matters addressed and to bring about reconciliation. I urge the House to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like previous members, I wholeheartedly support this motion before the House. I was not in the parliament when the original motion on reconciliation was passed, so I am very pleased to have the opportunity today to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), outlined the success stories of reconciliation. That process is continuing. The process of reconciliation does need some assistance at this time. This motion will do that. I will not go over them today, but some of the political events that have occurred in the last 18 months or so have certainly set back the process of reconciliation. Nevertheless, the process is a very worthwhile one. Obviously, I recognise the contribution of the opposition in its bipartisan support of the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I detect in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people some impatience in relation to reconciliation. We have to now look towards reconciliation as more of a grassroots process. If there is any criticism of what has happened so far, it is that it has been a little top heavy. There has certainly been a great deal of support from members of this parliament, representatives of industry and representatives of the Aboriginal community at a peak level. But the sort of thing that the previous member talked about in relation to local committees engendering some sort of community participation in reconciliation is obviously important. There is certainly scope for a greater degree of community participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area we have to look at is cultural understanding. Schools are very important in that respect. In my electorate, a lot of reconciliation is obviously going on in the schools. Some schools which have children of European origin are participating in Aboriginal and Islander dancing. I wonder how much that happens in schools outside electorates like mine where there are no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of employment is a vital one which I do not think we can ignore. Although there has been support from the top levels of business, I think local business communities could participate. Rotary clubs and chambers of commerce could participate a little more. If this parliamentary committee is formed, it could do something about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, one of the shared things that ought to be emphasised is the question of remoteness. The honourable member who preceded me in the debate, the honourable member for Aston, talked about the Cape York Peninsula. The remote Aboriginal communities on the Cape York Peninsula suffer the same adversity suffered by the European people on stations. Community groups are getting together and participating in the Cape York land use study. I pay special tribute to the Cape York Peninsula Development Association which, as part of that process and in other areas, is certainly putting forward the question of reconciliation. The parliament can play a key role in all of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to mention an event which has just occurred&mdash;an act of reconciliation which has just been announced by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), that is, the John Koowarta Reconciliation Law Scholarship. It is a joint initiative by the federal government, the Law Council and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation. By funding indigenous people to begin law studies each year and supporting the recipients through to completion of their degrees, the John Koowarta Reconciliation Law Scholarship aims to partially redress an acknowledged under-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the Australian legal system. Obviously, that is welcome. It was very good to see Mr Koowarta's widow, Mrs Martha Koowarta, speaking very eloquently on behalf of the cause of Aboriginal people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support this motion moved by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). It is a welcome motion which has already been passed by the majority of state parliaments. It has been passed by the Senate, the ACT Assembly, the Western Australian Assembly, the South Australian House of Assembly and the Tasmanian Legislative Council. It is certainly listed for introduction in the rest of the state parliaments. I think it is a very important symbolic gesture for both the federal and state parliaments. I compliment the council on the important work that it is doing in this area. I refer especially to the work of the chairman, Pat Dodson. I also thank the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), the previous shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, who has been the coalition's representative on the council, for the enormous amount of work he has done on the council, in concert, of course, with the other people whom he mentioned today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now make reference to the comments by the honourable member for Moreton which were said in a somewhat different tone to what was said last week. I congratulate the honourable member for his statements today. They are actually in stark contrast to the line taken by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). I encourage the honourable member to talk to his minister and perhaps encourage the minister to take this sort of line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) are also in the chamber today. Perhaps they should listen to the honourable member for Moreton, having regard to their acrimonious contributions to the previous debate on the land fund bill. It would have been helpful to both the Aboriginal cause and those seeking reconciliation if those three members had looked at the goal rather than their immediate gain in making this a divisive political issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a disappointment that those members chose to make this a divisive political issue because nobody gains from it. Perhaps the government does, but I think it is a poor gain in light of what is lost in the community. Members of the community as a whole, when they see division in this area, believe there is reason for division. That feeds on people who believe&mdash;and there are people in the community who believe&mdash;that too much has already been given to Aboriginal people. This is because they do not understand the issues. The last thing we need to do in parliament is to make them believe that they have reasons for their suspicions. The nature of the debate during the last sitting week, that was prompted by the government's response to the coalition's amendments, only fed prejudices in the community. I ask the government, as the debate continues today, to be sensible enough to change its tack on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining to me, may I say that Aboriginal people in Australia have suffered enormously because of ignorance and a whole host of factors that result from their dispossession of the land. Non-indigenous Australians have a very strong attachment to the land. We only have to see people who live on the land and to look at television reports of how strong their attachment is to their farms, which are now beset by drought, to know how much their land means to them. Aboriginal people have that same connection with their land, but theirs is also a spiritual and cultural connection. All the history of Aboriginal people is connected with their particular area of land. When they are dispossessed of that land, there are ramifications through their whole community&mdash;not just for particular individuals, but the whole community loses something that was the basis of how they came to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the land is one part of the healing process for many of those communities, but it is not the only healing part. As we would be aware from some of the shocking photographs and television documentaries we have seen, just returning to the land is not enough unless the resources are there to make sure that people who go back to the land have acceptable sanitation, clean water, housing and all those things that are necessary for a healthy lifestyle. At present, the health statistics in Aboriginal communities are a disgrace and a matter for shame for the whole of Australia. There are many other things that concern me in relation to Aboriginal affairs that I would like to talk about, but I shall leave those to another day. I commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that reconciliation in this country is one of the biggest issues we face, both now and in the future. The measures the government has been introducing over the last 18 months in response to the High Court's Mabo decision on native title have presented the first real opportunities we have had as a nation to address these important issues in a practical way. They will bring us together as a nation when all groups in this country can come forward to take their rightful places in this society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is about reconciliation and the ways we advance it, both here in this chamber and outside in the wider community. We have to accept that there is a generational element in the issues surrounding reconciliation, as well as a racial one. The hope for reconciliation in this country lies with young Australians, with the changing attitudes of older Australians, and with the commitment of both of these groups to the sense of unified nationhood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oodgeroo Noonuccal recognised the importance of future generations in the reconciliation process. I am reminded of an interview I saw on the ABC about a year before her death. She talked about the meetings she attended when various Aboriginal organisations in south-east Queensland came together. They would finish the meeting with a solemn toast&mdash;mind you, always with non-alcoholic drinks, she was careful to point out. The toast went:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To our Children,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bright Tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA>The bright tomorrow&mdash;that is what it is all about. The reality is that, to create that bright tomorrow, Australia has to acknowledge its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage. This motion specifically calls for us to support heritage. I welcome this initiative because it is only by coming to a lasting understanding of Aboriginal and Islander cultures that have been neglected for so long that we will be able to achieve true reconciliation. This includes acknowledging the connections of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to the land and the sea. Indeed, this was one of the eight key issues identified by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in its `Review of key issues' paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Charles Perkins said recently at the Melbourne launch of the group Australians for Reconciliation, we have to get away from narrowing the focus to purely Aboriginal reconciliation. We should really speak in terms of Australian reconciliation, and broaden the terms of reference. Charles Perkins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reconciliation has to occur between white and white, and black and black, between individuals, communities and organisations before it can even start between black and white.</PARA>
<PARA>His point, of course, was that every Australian has an interest in reconciliation, and it cannot happen in isolation. We have to encourage means by which we can advance reconciliation on a wide scale. This vital ingredient is integral to the future Australia we all want to see.

<PARA>Most of those definitions, I think, are relevant and appropriate because we do want a situation where indigenous and non-indigenous Australians are no longer opposed.

I know that the Aboriginal people that I know and represent and those that I am privileged to call friends are sick to death with the flow of words. I have to confess standing up here today that, in the time that I have been in this parliament and have spoken many times on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues, I have used an enormous number of words. Considering the state of our Aboriginal people over the last 200 years, there has been a great deal of improvement but, in recent times, not the improvement we want to see. </PARA>

Standards of living for Aboriginal people in an area regarded as one of the most beautiful growth areas of Australia are still Third World. I come back to a familiar theme because it is one that I believe in wholeheartedly: we cannot divorce the issues of health, housing, education and employment. Unless we solve those problems, we can talk about reconciliation until the cows come home. Those solutions are what have to come. </PARA>

We have the native title committee of this parliament, a joint statutory committee, and now we are going to form another committee.

Our position was one of principle and one of conscience and I believe that those members of the opposition to whom I have made reference held a similar position. But the shadow minister has to deliver. The good words and the good rhetoric are simply not sufficient. I make it clear that no-one from the opposition benches, particularly the shadow minister, who has a special responsibility in this area, will be allowed to get away with it.

There is a need for us to make sure that we deliver when we establish arrangements of this kind. I know that when a motion is sponsored by a person like the honourable member for Moreton it will deliver because he has made sure that his own committee delivers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to acknowledge all the previous speakers. I think we are all here today in a spirit of goodwill on this important issue. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) talked about the definition of reconciliation. When I hear that word `reconciliation' and I think of the Aboriginal people I do not think of reconciliation, from my experience of Aboriginal people, in terms of an aggressive relationship.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion on and the widespread use of the term `Aboriginal reconciliation' gained prominence during the bicentenary commemorations of 1988 and the debate on reconciliation has often been connected to a formal treaty. In 1991 the minister released a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aboriginal reconciliation</EMPHASIS>, which proposed the establishment of the present council. This was passed in a bill in that same year. The establishment of the council was supported by the opposition. It is worth noting that earlier the opposition had stated that it would not support a treaty because it would be divisive and a nation cannot have a treaty with itself. Nevertheless, the opposition did support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patrick Dodson says the native population was dispossessed without a treaty, agreement or compensation and he would not have taken the position of chairperson of the council unless he thought he could achieve a treaty to redress that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simple position is that we will proceed with the concept of a treaty within Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>When speaking to the Press Club in 1993, Patrick Dodson acknowledged that it would not be easy. He said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Council sees a united Australia, and this implies that we will be united on terms and conditions negotiated by us . . . (the Council) does not support correcting historical injustices with contemporary unfairness.</PARA>
<PARA>Some Australians believe that the current legislation is still unfair. They believe that more and more programs and legislation are biased towards Aboriginals and are discriminating against non-Aboriginals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House, cognisant as it is of Australia's opposition to the economic exploitation of children, as expressed in Article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, calls on the Government to enact legislation to prohibit the importation of goods produced by child labour.</PARA>
<PARA>In December 1990, Australia ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The convention came into force for Australia on 16 January 1991. Article 32 of the convention says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. States Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. States Parties shall take legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to ensure the implementation of the present article. To this end, and having regard to the relevant provisions of other international instruments, States Parties shall in particular:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) Provide for a minimum age or minimum ages for admission to employment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) Provide for appropriate regulation of the hours and conditions of employment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c) Provide for appropriate penalties or other sanctions to ensure the effective enforcement of the present article.</PARA>
<PARA>Often in this place, the view is expressed that we should not be a signatory to conventions and treaties that extend the power of the Commonwealth. This was not the case with the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994, which was passed unanimously in this House and agreed to in another place. During the debate, one speaker after another made reference to article 34 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 34 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States Parties undertake to protect the child from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse. For these purposes, States Parties shall in particular take all appropriate national, bilateral and multicultural measures to prevent:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a) The inducement or coercion of a child to engage in any unlawful sexual activity;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b) The exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c) The exploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials.</PARA>
<PARA>In his second reading speech, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) stated that Australia's ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . imposes an obligation . . . at both the national and the international level . . . Australia played a key role in the development of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian government is committed to pursuing the aims of that convention.</PARA>
<PARA>During the same debate the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) expressed his support for the use of the external affairs power. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has had considerable difficulty with the use of the external affairs power by recent Labor governments, which have engaged in the practice of entering into international treaties and using those treaties to expand the reach of Commonwealth power. I am pleased to say that in this case the coalition has no such difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was used to defend legislation against the sexual exploitation of children, should also apply to the protection of children overseas who are exploited in an economic context. It is an unfortunate contradiction that those who speak the language of labour market reform will be the first to mount the stump in opposition to the sexual exploitation of children but the first to tell you that you have no right to interfere with the working conditions some exploitative bosses or rampant multinationals wish to foist on young children in the interests of increased profit. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) during the Crimes Amendment (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill debate said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . children are being exploited or being managed by someone who benefits from that act of exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA>How do the custodians of morality distinguish between the child sex procurer or the child labour exploiting factory owner? Members of this House spoke strongly on the issue of sexual exploitation of children. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) gave us a very vivid account of the various forms of sexual abuse of some children&mdash;I almost had to turn the television off&mdash;and the member for Moore (Mr Filing) outlined the manner in which Westerners cynically exploit Asian children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: are we prepared to transfer our moral indignation to the arena of economic exploitation of children? Are we prepared to discuss the possibility that legislation prohibiting the importation of goods produced by child labour would encourage reform in those countries which currently exploit children? Or are we to follow the philosophy of the Lyons Forum and express moral outrage only when sex is involved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the House was debating the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions issued a report entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child labour: the world's best kept secret</EMPHASIS>. It estimated that over 100 million children between the ages of four and 15 are exploited as cheap, compliant labour. In order to carry out its campaign against child labour, the ICFTU asked its affiliates and other trade unionists around the world to carry out research into child labour in their own countries. This report contains field studies from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mexico and the Philippines, and further reports in Colombia, Brazil and Peru will follow. According to the ICFTU, these field studies were carried out in the face of opposition from employers, as we would expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Nepal, where the use of child labour in the carpet industry is notorious, there is no child protection act. This is despite a constitution which stipulates that `children shall not be employed in factories, mines or similar hazardous work'. The ICFTU provided a litany of cases of exploitation of children in sweatshops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Philippines, where the constitution forbids the employment of children younger than 15 except under the responsibility of parents or guardians, the ICFTU field study examined the workings of a German textiles multinational which produces bras, girdles, panties and bikinis. Like some Australian companies, the company is attracted to the Philippines where child labour provides low wages. Of course, as the study discovered, reputable companies do not employ child labour directly but contract work to local firms and ask no questions. These firms employ child labour themselves or subcontract the work again. Some children start working at the age of four. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounts of economic exploitation and abuse of children found in the ICFTU report call for a response from this parliament. If honourable members are prepared to overcome the legal problems involved in legislating against sexual exploitation of children, then they should have the courage to challenge the economic exploitation of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the disciples of free trade want to blow their trumpet about the low priced imports Australian consumers can buy once tariffs are lowered or removed, they should examine the conditions under which these goods are made. How can the rights of Australian workers be protected on a level playing field which signals to Australian industry that to be competitive in the production of, for instance, underwear they ought to take advantage of child labour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the Wills by-election, various Australian manufacturers told me that the only way they could survive with lower tariffs was to go offshore. Many did not want to do that. If Australians go overseas to sexually exploit children, the Australian parliament goes further than moral outrage and legislates for penalties of up to 17 years imprisonment. If an Australian manufacturer goes overseas and employs people who abuse and exploit children, the free market worshippers put a medal on its chest. </PARA>

Kailash Satyarthi, chairperson of SACCS, describes it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As long as children work, they will remain uneducated. They are losing their eyes, their lungs and different parts of their bodies. And so they will remain a liability for their nation. They can never become an asset.</PARA>
<PARA>Sometimes attempts at rectifying economic exploitation in Third World countries are countered with the claim that it is a form of cultural imperialism.

<PARA>He goes on to say that he has asked his department to closely monitor the ILO's program to eliminate child labour and consider the possible means by which we may be able to contribute to this program. This motion is timely. It is only right and proper that the House is considering it today. Many commentators, I guess, including the honourable member for Wills, would point out that right wing policies, the policies of the IMF and the World Bank, and austerity measures leading to the diminution of the safety net and social security measures, as well as the general deregulation movement, are the direct causes of the growth of child labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters cannot be ignored. I do not want to sweep those arguments under the carpet, but I think this is part of a broader debate in relation to free trade and GATT. The problem is serious and has to be addressed. It has to be addressed by governments; it has to be addressed as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true to say that there has been increased publicity in relation to the problem of child labour. There has been a recent ABC radio program and an SBS program; there has been a bill introduced into the US Senate; and there is also article 32 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The numerous instances of child labour across the globe, affecting children as young as six years&mdash;not only in the developing world but also in places such as Portugal, the United States and Russia&mdash;should concern every member of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our electorates we all celebrate the International Year of the Family, but how can we honestly celebrate the year of the family yet tolerate the growing instances of child labour across the globe? How can we ignore the carpet weaving and glass making industries in India and Pakistan, industries which use children as young as six years? It is estimated that there are 44 million children in child labour in India alone. How can we ignore the estimate of over 100,000 children working as domestic servants in Haiti, children who receive little or no pay, who have no education and no control over their daily lives? How can we ignore the children working in the underground coalmines in Colombia and the gold mines in Peru, the children working amongst hazardous and noxious fumes in the leather industry in Egypt or the children used as forced labour in infrastructure projects in Burma?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The literature indicates that the majority of children in forced and child labour are in the agricultural industry. There are also instances of children being used as sex workers. The effect on the health of the children who work long and hard hours, often at night, is appalling. Reports on the carpet factories in Pakistan in 1991 estimated that half of the 50,000 bonded children in that industry did not reach the age of 12. They are victims of malnutrition and work related disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A WHO report on child workers cites other physical health hazards including bone lesions and postural deformity, attributable to such work as carpet weaving, embroidery and lifting heavy weights. Young growing bodies suffer from strain when overloaded since the bone structure, especially the spine, is soft. The eyesight of young girls working 12 to 14 hours a day in micro-computer factories or embroideries is reported to be damaged within five to eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earning power of these children is low. Children in Indonesian light bulb factories work eight hours a day, six days a week and earn the equivalent of $US3 a week. Children in Nepalese carpet factories get $1 a day or less. The effect on the education of these children is devastating. Some of the children are in education. They work all night, then go to school during the day. I do not know how effective that is. And most of them do not go to school at all. The primary school drop-out rate in Bangladesh is 80 per cent. What is the solution to the problem? I do not reject in any way the option put up by the honourable member for Wills, but the matter has to be taken further on a broader plane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Action cannot be taken only by government. The role of non-government organisations is vital. The trade union movement, certainly in the West, has a role to play, but Australian business also should apply ethical standards. That is why I am interested to hear what the coalition has to say in relation to this motion, because business does have a role to play. The ACTU, under the leadership of Martin Ferguson, has, rightly, been taking an aggressive stance on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU and the ICFTU are working towards a social clause to ensure the right to free, independent trade unions and established standards and conditions, including the prevention of child labour, to be written into the GATT and the new General Agreement on Trade in Services. These rights must be spelt out. They cannot be embodied in some sort of bland, motherhood statement, if I might use that term; they have to be enforceable. There is also a move to include the rights of workers in the policies and programs of the IMF and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that child labour is nominally outlawed in most of the countries where abuse takes place.

Action has to be taken by Western governments like the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member referred to banning imports produced by child labour. Another approach may be to introduce labelling guaranteeing that goods have not been produced by exploited children.

The ILO is progressing and the government has indicated, as instanced by my earlier quote, that the minister is open to options. This motion strengthens that.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Childhood is a period of life which should be devoted not to work, but to education and training; child labour, by its very nature and the working conditions in which it is carried out, often compromises children's potential to become productive and useful adults in society; finally, the use of child labour is not inevitable, and progress toward its elimination is possible wherever there is political will to oppose it with determination.</PARA>

It is to our shame and to the government's `Neville Chamberlain' approach to Asia and uncritical acceptance of World Bank economic fundamentalism that it has not been raised before.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning of the industrial revolution, capitalism has sought to exploit labour. The history of labour market conditions has been horrific at every level. Slavery, children in mines, forced labour for illiterate women&mdash;the story and its horrors are endless. No avenue of exploitation has been left unexplored. No means that could reduce labour costs have been left untouched. Any attempt to provide humane and fair working conditions has been fought relentlessly at every stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the fight to eliminate slavery in Britain around 1800 it was argued that if Britain renounced slavery other countries would seize an economic advantage. Similarly, every reduction of working hours has been opposed. The same arguments were used to justify horrific working conditions, particularly for children and women. The same historical struggle is true of exploitation of the environment. Through a variety of interventions over the last 200 years most of the worst examples of exploitation have been removed in industrialised countries, although much remains to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s, however, saw a giant leap backwards through the doctrine of economic fundamentalism and free trade. Deregulation and free trade aim to locate manufacturing in the lowest cost countries and export freely to the world operating within a framework of authoritarian, largely corrupt governments with minimal labour and environmental standards. As a result, an even more horrific version of the labour market conditions and environmental degradation of early 19th century industrialised countries is now being replicated in the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aided by authoritarian regimes, the industrial revolution of the West has been telescoped into a decade. Massive urbanisation, shantytowns, sulfurous landscapes, horrendous pollution and appalling working conditions are now the norm throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic fundamentalists will sneer at the relatively `new found concern' of the West for the labour conditions of children. They will, like their 19th century predecessors, argue every esoteric position, from interference with national sovereignty to character assassination, to avoid any interference with the free market or the use of trade policy to ameliorate Third World industrial practices. Equally, they will do and say anything to avoid responsibility and anything which would hamper unchecked profits for multinational firms. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if economic fundamentalism and an integrated world economy are magically and rapidly improving Third World conditions. Any dispassionate examination shows it is creating unbelievably obscene disparities in wealth.

The legislation would then require efforts by the US President to ensure that America's action would not be one out: to ban those countries and industries that do not have the required labelling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There can be no justification for the exploitation of child workers and the Australian government must do all it can to end child labour. I am certainly not suggesting that children should not work. I support the notion of children helping around the home and on the family farm and admire the teenagers who work for a few hours each weekend to help supplement the family income. However, the term `child labour' refers to something very different. It is used to refer to the exploitation and abuse of children as workers. When a child's right to education, to health, to dignity&mdash;perhaps even to youth&mdash;is extinguished by long hours of work under poor conditions and for little pay, then this child is a child labourer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of child labour is such that it is largely invisible to statisticians. Most child labourers do not work in the official economy. They are unpaid labourers on the family farms; they are working illegally in small manufacturing; they are working on the streets selling newspapers, chewing gum, matches and their bodies. However, other examples of child labour can be quite visible. The use of children in the carpet factories of India and on the tobacco plantations of Zimbabwe is perfectly plain to see. The impact on children of this form of abuse is profound. Frequently, young bodies cannot sustain the duration and intensity of tasks and children succumb to malnutrition and disease. Even if they survive, the life chances of these children are severely limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the international community into which these children have been born, Australia has a responsibility to concern itself with their welfare. I understand what has motivated the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) to call for this legislation, which prohibits the importation into Australia of goods produced by child labour. I congratulate him for raising this matter today. However, I do not believe that such legislation would be effective. A ban on the importation of goods produced by child labourers would not have any significant impact on the overall prevalence of child labour. With a few notable exceptions, child labourers are not involved in producing exportable goods. For children servicing the domestic economy, the trade sanctions that are being suggested would have no impact; indeed, I suggest that trade sanctions may exacerbate the poverty that is among the root causes of child labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child labourers are invariably the victims of necessity. Their families are poor. They do not have enough shelter or food. They do not have education. They are working to help their families survive. By constructing barriers to trade between the developing and the developed worlds, we are consolidating the poverty that causes child labour. While there are occasions on which it may be appropriate to use trade sanctions to enforce internationally agreed upon human rights standards, it is entirely counterproductive to use trade sanctions when the human rights abuses being targeted have an economic rather than a political cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lessons to be learnt from the recent United Nations population conference in Cairo. We have known for many years that we must curb the rate at which the world population is growing. In the past, the developed world's response to this problem has been to either turn a blind eye or hand out contraceptives. In Cairo a new approach to international action was adopted. The need to increase the decision making power of women&mdash;a power which has both a social and an economic dimension&mdash;was acknowledged. Future efforts will be directed towards giving women the resources to take control of their bodies. The problems of child labour must be addressed in a similar fashion. Child labourers work to survive. If we are to help these children, we must address the economic and social context which determines their lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I cannot support the motion put by the member for Wills, I share his concern in seeing that Australian laws and actions are consistent with the international standards set out in the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child. My former colleague and friend Andrew Peacock said in this place on 21 February 1991 that, if the coalition had been in government at that time, it would have ratified the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. On several occasions my actions in this House have been inspired by this convention. I am referring specifically to my call for the practice of female genital mutilation to be outlawed in Australia and also to my support of legislation to outlaw participation in child sex tours by Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, while unable to support the motion to outlaw the importation of goods produced by child labour, this parliament must endeavour to act in accordance with the standards set out in the Declaration of the Rights of the Child.

<PARA>It is dry. I am not talking about my speech or any of the preceding speeches in the House of Representatives. The simple reality is that 1994 happens to see Australia gripped by what could well be an economically disastrous drought. With the exception of the south-east corner of the continent, much of the nation is gripped by drought. In the case of my own state, South Australia, its outlook is not as grim as that of New South Wales and Queensland, but even in South Australia many farmers are on a knife edge. Much of the west coast of South Australia looks like facing a situation where, even if it rained, they would be denied this year's crop. That, of course, is nothing like as precipitous as the case that exists in Queensland, where so much of that state is currently experiencing its third year of drought. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a South Australian, I have a particular interest in the Murray and in the quality of the Murray water. I find it a very sobering reality that there are times when as much as 50 per cent of suburban Adelaide's water is sourced out of the Murray and that, in times of particularly high demand and particularly low rainfall when Adelaide's own reservoirs are run down, as much as 80 per cent of its water can for a brief time be sourced from the Murray. Add to that the simple reality that the Spencer Gulf cities, much of my own electorate in the mid-north of South Australia, and the Yorke Peninsula are dependent on the Murray and we see why South Australians are so concerned about the state and quality of the water available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a parochial motion. The importance of the Murray Basin to everyone in Australia cannot be overestimated. The simple fact is that the Murray Basin makes up one-third of the agricultural output of this nation. It occupies one-seventh of our surface area but it happens to be host to 25 per cent of the cattle and dairy herds in Australia, 50 per cent of the sheep and 75 per cent of the irrigated land. As a result of the relative prosperity of the Murray-Darling Basin, $10 billion a year is generated from crops in those regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asking in this private member's motion for the government to consider making a clean-up of the River Murray and its basin a priority for the centenary of Federation. I do this on good authority. I notice that in the committee chaired by the Hon. Joan Kirner, which was set up to recommend various projects to the present government for the centenary of Federation, the Premier of South Australia, Mr Brown, recommended&mdash;and his sentiments were endorsed&mdash;that a clean-up of the Murray-Darling Basin ought to be one of the ways we go about celebrating our centenary of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to suggest a couple of projects that I think the government could usefully embrace as it endeavours on behalf of all Australians to undertake an environmental initiative that we can all applaud. I mention the first of those projects because I am a South Australian, but it is not a project that solely benefits South Australia. I would like to suggest that the government consider expanding the freshwater research facilities that currently exist at Albury-Wodonga so that a sublaboratory can be set up somewhere west of the Darling inflow&mdash;I nominate Mildura because it is not in South Australia and I therefore do not seem quite so parochial&mdash;to monitor the quality of the water that flows into South Australia after the Darling has met the Murray. I make that point because Captain Sturt, in his diary in 1853, noted and expressed concern at what scientists today believe was a blue-green algal bloom at the confluence of the Murray and Darling rivers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular concern being felt by all Australians, and particularly by South Australians, is that in a year as dry as this we have the potential for an enormous blue-green algal outbreak right on our doorstep. If we are to monitor blue-green algal blooms and find appropriate control measures, we need research to be done in Albury-Wodonga at the Murray-Darling Freshwater Research Institute as is being done now but also to be duplicated further down the river where clearly the chemical composition and characteristics of that water have changed markedly as it has made its way through the states of both New South Wales and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in fact chairman of a committee looking at the feasibility of such a facility, and the member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), who is in the chamber, is the deputy chairman of that committee. In a bipartisan sense, we have endeavoured to approach all of the state governments likely to be affected to seek some funding for an expanded role for the freshwater institute at Albury-Wodonga. I would like to put a similar plea through the parliament to the government of the Commonwealth of Australia. I have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and clearly, as you would expect, I have written to the Hon. Joan Kirner recommending that this sort of facility be established so that not only can South Australians have a technique for monitoring the water that flows into South Australia but real work can be done in blue-green algal control which would have particular impact for those people who live on the Darling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, with river flows as low as they are and with the Darling effectively stationary, we have a great deal to be concerned about in terms of what, as I said earlier, may be potential blue-green algal blooms. Frankly, governments at the state and Commonwealth level need to be seen to be very diligent in monitoring those blooms. Part of that diligence would be the expansion of the existing work of the Albury-Wodonga freshwater research facility by the establishment of a laboratory somewhere west of the Darling inflow. I think that laboratory would allow us to monitor much more carefully the useful control mechanisms for blue-green algae, particularly as much of the research work has already been done and now needs to be modified to suit the river as it changes as a result of the Darling's inflow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it would be appropriate to look seriously at cleaning up the Murray-Darling Basin, to consider what is currently happening as a result of sewage inflows into the Murray-Darling. I am not here apportioning blame, because these various sewerage schemes were set up under a range of governments, but it is a simple fact that the majority of the pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin occurs as a result of sewage treatment works which are either still located on the flood plain or discharge part of their treated sewage into the Murray or Darling systems. It has been estimated that up to 70 per cent of the pollution in the Murray-Darling Basin occurs as a result of sewage inflows. Given that there are a number of major sewerage plants discharging effluent into the river and given the number of plants that still have evaporation basins on the flood plains, there is a desperate need for a national perspective on effectively cleaning up these sewage plants and locating them away from the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the member for Mallee, I have seen much of the work that has been done in the Sunraysia region. It is very much to the credit of the Mildura irrigation trust that there has been an effective sewage treatment works established for all of Mildura's sewage treatment well away from the river and that this treated sewage water is now being used to grow native trees on, from memory, about 200 acres. The area is larger than 200 acres, but about 200 acres is planted with native trees on drippers taking up this sewage water. I am familiar with a similar project that exists at Loxton. These projects have been undertaken by a concerned local community. I think this is the sort of thing that needs to be done across the entire basin, if we are serious about having a cleaned up basin with which to celebrate the centenary of Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand not in criticism of the government. Much is being done now to reduce salinity in the Murray. As a Murray River irrigator, I think I get better quality water now than I did 20 years ago. We ought not be too despondent about the state of the river. The centenary of Federation gives us a great opportunity to push that project further. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I agree with him that the work already done to clean up the Murray-Darling and its catchment has been laudable. I also agree that more needs to be done. However, being parochial&mdash;and the honourable member was trying not to be, but I will be&mdash;I have to say that a waterways project such as that proposed to mark the centenary of Federation should not be limited to the Murray-Darling. We should use the expertise gained from the environmental management of the Murray-Darling and apply it to all of our waterways&mdash;with particular reference, of course, to the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House last year debated a bill to revise the agreement that exists between the Commonwealth and three state governments for the management of the Murray-Darling Basin. That agreement developed from arrangements set in place as early as 1914 for regulating the supply of water to downstream parts of the basin. I think that agreement is a highly significant political and administrative achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Hayden once said that the principles of environmental law challenge the existing notions of private property rights because they deal with things that occur over large areas unrelated to property boundaries or with things that flow from place to place. He could well have said that familiar political rights are similarly challenged by the demands of environmental management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business of government has traditionally been about management of contrived divisions of the land&mdash;states, shires and cities bounded by lines drawn with little or no reference to the natural features of the land or to the living systems in place. Those contrived divisions have generated rivalries and disjunctions that place enormous obstacles in the way of sound environmental management. The Murray-Darling agreement shows that we are learning to transcend those traditional impediments. Although it has taken us a long time to see the damage we have done to the river system, we now have an effective tool for the enormous task of restoring it, where possible, and implementing sustainable practices for the use of its resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Macquarie, I have watched with close interest the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin agreement. The Hawkesbury, which is in my electorate, is the next-door neighbour of the Murray-Darling. I am very interested to see how it is going about fixing its problems and what it is using to do it. The most obvious thing that the Hawkesbury has in common with the Murray-Darling is that the need for restoration and sustainable future management have become critical. Unlike the Murray-Darling, however, the Hawkesbury has no history of overall catchment management systems or agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A trust for management of part of the Hawkesbury has been established by the New South Wales government, and there are great expectations for what that body may achieve. I believe that past and future experiences of the Murray-Darling will be important for the Hawkesbury trust and I hope that the lessons learnt in one catchment are carried across into the other wherever they are appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murray-Darling system covers one-seventh of the land area of the continent. The rivers are under stress because of the demands arising from the scale and diversity of land uses within such a huge area. The Hawkesbury catchment is much smaller, but the river is under extreme stress because it embraces the inexorably sprawling Sydney metropolitan area. My electorate covers some of the most vulnerable and worst affected sections of the river&mdash;the sections where it flows through the soft alluvial plain. Those are the places where settlement and development have been concentrated and where the greatest demand occurs for future urban growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two hundred years of agricultural use have left the catchment generally denuded of its original native forest cover. Despite pronouncements by Governor Macquarie, the banks were cleared early and have suffered much abuse. The banks have also been weakened by many years of in-stream dredging and sand extraction that have altered forever the hydrological characteristics of the river. Anyone who has seen the pitiable state of the banks of the Hawkesbury River downstream from Windsor would surely agree with Bill Hayden's contention that certain `rights' ought to be challenged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Degradation of wetlands is another factor that the Hawkesbury River shares with the Murray-Darling. Most of the original wetlands of the Hawkesbury were within my electorate, but much of the system's capacity for water purification has been lost as they have been drained, cleared and filled. It is imperative that wetlands in the Hawkesbury system be restored and protected and that land capable of supporting created wetlands be set aside to deal with future development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Hawkesbury basin, despite its urban image, is the source of a surprising amount of farm and market garden production. The Sydney market benefits from the large quantities of fresh vegetables and fruit that are grown close by, and the Windsor district is the state's largest supplier of mushrooms to domestic and overseas markets. The estuarine regions of the Hawkesbury River are important oyster farming and prawn harvesting areas and they also play a crucial part in the life cycle of fish species that underpin offshore fisheries. All this production is threatened by an increasing urbanisation in the catchment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preservation of agricultural land is becoming an increasingly important factor in the debate about future land use in the Sydney basin. Agricultural production is threatened by increasing salinity and encroaching urbanisation. The famous blue-green algae is perhaps the most spectacular manifestation of river degradation. The Murray-Darling achieved international notoriety with dramatic aerial shots of 1,500 kilometres of water the colour of turf. The Hawkesbury had a much smaller bloom at the same time, but the effect on the regional consciousness was profound and confusing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An occurrence of algae is of the greatest significance to the Hawkesbury River as a symptom of environmental degradation throughout the catchment area rather than as an event in itself. Algae grows well in water that is rich in nutrients and that flows slowly&mdash;and here we come to the crux of the issue for the Hawkesbury: population growth in the Sydney basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One-fifth of the Australian population now withdraws and diverts water from the Hawkesbury for domestic, agricultural and industrial purposes. Water that should flow in the Hawkesbury is flowing instead through long and expensive deep ocean outfalls off the coast of Sydney. The river receives sewage effluent treated to various degrees of purity from nearly one million people. Sometimes in summer that effluent is nearly all the flow there is in the river. If current predictions come to pass, by the end of the century the Hawkesbury will be giving up its water to about one quarter of the total Australian population. It will be receiving treated sewage from an extra one million people and will be expected to provide a range of recreational facilities and experiences for many of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The relationship between the water required by such a population, the rate at which people use water in the future and the amount of water available in the system must be seriously addressed. The environmental consequences of withdrawing even more water from the Hawkesbury River must become determinants for planning the future of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the issue is about the future development of Sydney and New South Wales. Why does Sydney continue to grow at the expense of the environment in the Hawkesbury basin and at the expense of the economies and communities of rural New South Wales? It is now imperative to simultaneously take control of the cancerous growth of Sydney and the death by neglect of the rest of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Murray-Darling has a federal government overview because it crosses state boundaries. I sincerely wish the Hawkesbury crossed a few boundaries as well. The issues relating to the Hawkesbury are as important to the nation as those of the Murray-Darling. There is a legitimate federal role in the Hawkesbury. The centenary of Federation is an appropriate time to ensure that this still beautiful river is returned to some measure of its original state. I hope that by 2001 we will be able to see significant progress towards that goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that this year is the bicentenary of the Hawkesbury basin. For 200 years, that area has been the food basket of what was the colony, and now is the city, of Sydney. We are celebrating a major event before the centenary of Federation, so it gives us another excuse. I certainly hope by that time that as the member for Macquarie I will see for the Hawkesbury a concentration of effort and a unity of purpose that matches the one expressed in the Murray-Darling agreement. </PARA>

The fact that probably 14 electorates embrace the Murray-Darling Basin gives us all an opportunity to dwell on just how important this part of Australia really is. While I appreciate that the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) wanted to talk about an important waterway in her electorate, the honourable member for Wakefield and I would like to draw the attention of the House to, and concentrate on, the economic significance of the Murray-Darling Basin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 25 years, it is true that there have been considerable advances in the many environmental interactions which occur in the Murray-Darling Basin. I can remember as a youngster&mdash;25 years ago I could be regarded as that&mdash;absolute panic for citrus growers associated with my family when the salinity of the Murray River was so bad that irrigation had to be carefully administered to trees and crops. Regrettably, some of that still exists. But, with better management, a better research effort, better understanding and the cooperation of the states and the federal government, river salinity is much more sustainable as is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Latterly&mdash;other speakers have already made reference to this&mdash;there has been the threat of blue-green algae. Recently I took part in an inspection of the entire length of the Darling River.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Whilst we have made great strides in salt management, the understanding and ability to control algae is still in its infancy. In his motion, the honourable member for Wakefield has called on the government to accelerate its consideration of priority projects to clear up the catchment and mark the centenary of Federation. What more fitting thing could there be to celebrate the centenary of our Federation than a recognition of the economic value and importance of the Murray-Darling Basin. It has the potential in the next century to be the food bowl of the international region of which we are a part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are ever to achieve this, we need to think a further 100 years ahead towards the bicentenary of Federation. If we in the coalition have any say in it, it will be a bicentenary of our Federation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Salt is a natural by-product from the soils of an arid country like Australia. The many mistakes we have made in the past can be useful to learn from, but we need to look to the future. Huge areas of the basin are underlain by a pristine saltwater basin and, after 150 years of land clearing, irrigation and the maintenance of high river levels, this salty ground water has moved inexorably upwards. In the vast dry land mallee areas of my electorate, this ground water is so close to the surface that salt scolds are increasing in area at a rate of 15 per cent per annum, thereby impacting dramatically on the productive capacity of the land for agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful for the government's recent commitment to fund stage 2 of piping of the Wimmera Mallee stock and domestic channel supply system. This open channel stock and domestic system has served the area well and has helped to open up the inhospitable Mallee to grain and stock production.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with some reservation that I support the motion of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on the River Murray Basin. It is clear that it has bipartisan support in this chamber, but this does not mean that anything will happen. I suspect that is due to the nature of Australia. So many people live on the coast around Australia that we are now watching the development of a complete dichotomy between city and rural Australia. It is a situation of great concern and, if it continues, I do not believe this nation can survive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot be accused of holding a parochial view in relation to the River Murray. My electorate in Western Australia is far from the Murray. Even though I spent my childhood growing up on the lower reaches of the Murray, that was a long time ago. I am concerned about the plight of the Murray for economic reasons because a degradation of that environment will affect the economy of Australia as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield said that $10 billion worth of produce comes out of the Murray valley. I believe that this figure is grossly understated and, certainly, if a multiplier effect is added, $10 billion is only a fraction of the value of the Murray to Australia. I am reliably informed that, if the Murray were to go saline, two out of five jobs that exist in Australia at the moment would be lost. Most of those jobs lost would be in the cities and I believe, therefore, that there is a clear responsibility on government and the people in the cities to help fund the much needed campaign to restore the Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not put a lot of faith in that. I put much greater store by economic achievements in the Murray itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The largest market in the world for table grapes is the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom imports a billion dollars worth of table grapes every year. It would take Australia five years to gear up to supply that demand if we were to start tomorrow. Many years ago, two enterprising brothers at Renmark went and had a look at Europe, decided what sort of grape the British wanted, came back and were happy to provide it. Britain is a particular market, requiring a soft skinned, sweet, seedless, green grape. That is the definition of a sultana grape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The brothers came back to Australia and, despite frustrations by AQIS, the government quarantine organisation, were able to assemble three container loads, which they got to the London market. It took three months to do that. Those grapes, sold on the London market, travelled very well and fetched a then world record price for grapes&mdash;twice the Australian providing price. The brothers came back with order books full, only to be met with obstruction from AQIS, which was able to have the banning of sultana grapes for domestic purposes instituted in Australia. For a whole year they could not legally export these grapes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had we been able to establish that market then&mdash;we still can now if we have the will&mdash;it would have added enormously to the value of a crop. If the Murray valley were to produce domestic table grapes for that British market it could afford to use trickle irrigation, which is a much more effective use of the water than for growing grapes for wine or for dried fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wakefield said that sewage is one of the great sources of pollution for the River Murray, but pollution from sewage is mainly in the area of phosphorous nitrogen and, I guess to some extent, heavy metals. Salinity is not generally affected by that. To affect salinity we either have to get greater flow in the Murray or use less water. If we could have more efficient irrigation we would be achieving both, but this can be done only with an economic base. </PARA>

Therefore, the inclusion of Queensland in the Murray-Darling Basin in this relatively new agreement is very important in bringing further oversight of the Darling into the total management of that system. However, as is described in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission annual report of 1992-93, the powers of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission are limited in respect of the Darling River upstream from the Menindee Lakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very important limitation. I hope that, as time passes and more emphasis is placed on quality and an integrated management of the system, the Darling River upstream from the Menindee Lakes will come under stricter management. In the past the Darling River has always, by repute in South Australia, provided good quality water which South Australia has, at times, been very dependent on. It has been turbid water, but it has, in the past, been low in salinity. It is extremely discouraging to look at the impact of the blue-green algae in the past to 1991 and the prospect of it in the future if this is to be a dry year. There has been great variation in the flows of the river system which places more emphasis on the need for management. The annual report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rivers of the Murray-Darling Basin were first developed for irrigation in the 1880s. Since then, the quantity of water diverted from the Murray-Darling River system has increased steadily. Now, on average, two-thirds of the water that originally would have reached the sea is diverted.</PARA>
<PARA>That illustrates the impact and the need for far greater management of the system. The annual report also goes on to mention the annual flows of the Murray. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>That illustrates the enormous variations in the flow of the system and the consequent pressure on that system. The effect of saline ground waters on the system and the many aspects of management which had a great impetus when the agreement for the Dartmouth Dam was implemented in bringing a number of important rivers within the management of the system in Victoria have already been mentioned in this debate. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting the motion on the basis that it is much better to prevent a problem by efficient and effective management than to deal with it after it has occurred.

Those are some of the concerns addressed by the committee. Fortunately, the natural resources management strategy, the NRMS, which commenced prior to 1989, was reviewed in 1993 to refocus its aims. The points to come out of that, which has been mentioned by one or two speakers, are the impost of salinity and the nature of landcare programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, you may or may not agree that, while the landcare programs address certain aspects which are causing concern, it really comes down to a sea change in some of the attitudes and some of the practices in those areas. The issue of rising ground water has been mentioned by previous speakers. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) mentioned the need to plant trees and how that addresses the rising ground water problem, and there has also been reference to how run off water from the urban areas in the basin is treated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I believe that funding landcare programs is not  necessarily the complete answer to the problem. There has to be a change of opinion within the community. That is why most of the programs that the federal and state governments have put in place involve communities to a certain extent. Without the community owning some of the solutions we will not get that broad based community response to the problem. I think it is most important, wherever we go from here&mdash;and I certainly agree with the thrust of the motion, though I do have some reservations about some aspects of it; I agree that the assiduous use of irrigation water and the upgrading of the existing drainage and effluent schemes are priorities&mdash;that there be a sea change within the community.

You represent the irrigation areas of the Riverland and I represent the irrigation areas of both the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and the Coleambally Irrigation Area. I notice in the motion that you say it will take 25 years to clean up the River Murray. It has only been in recent times that the River Murray Commission has had this responsibility. It was once a distribution organisation for water of the Murray and its tributaries, but now it has been given the task of making sure that the quality of water in that system is what it should be.</PARA></TALK.START>

The mayor of Wagga Wagga and his council are trying to do everything in their power to stop effluent going into the river. This has been done in cooperation with the mayor of Hay, Mick Beckwith. Along with the council and the people of Hay, he has complained for years that the quality of water in the Murrumbidgee River is getting worse. They are trying to do something about the problem. They are putting their money where their mouths are and trying to improve the quality of the water in the Murrumbidgee River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that we have to be concerned about is the amount of water that is available to people in Australia. Australia, like many other countries in the world, is very dry. We are perhaps not the driest in the world, but we are certainly up amongst the leaders. The drought announcement of recent days has brought home how precious water is to us. It is not only affecting those people in the dry land areas but will also produce problems in the irrigation areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very fortunate with our dam system, but if we look at the water in the New South Wales dams as in July we see that Glenlyon Dam is at only seven per cent of its total capacity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His political life was lived out here under the period of seven Prime Ministers, starting in 1966. He joined the government when the likes of Sir John McEwen and the Rt Hon. Sir Paul Hasluck were in the Holt cabinet. He joined the Gorton ministry three years later in 1969 and then served in a number of portfolios: Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Industrial Relations, Minister for Industry and Commerce, Minister for the Army and Minister for External Territories. This was over quite an extensive period&mdash;from 1969 to 1972 and from 1975 mostly to 1983. So he had a relatively long period of ministerial office. He was Leader of the Opposition, elected by his party on two occasions, which is, I think, a fairly rare distinction and a rare level of support shown by the party. It believed, obviously, that he was best qualified to discharge the responsibilities of the leadership of the opposition, which is always a very difficult office to fill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the House he often provided a dash of colour, and he was one of the parliament's more colourful performers. He was one of the more modern 20th century Liberals, but was often thwarted by some of the more conservative elements of his own party. In some ways he was able to see the bigger picture. The fact that he had a life outside of politics was very important to him.

He did say at a press conference, in a very revealing remark, `I don't know whether I ever wanted to be Prime Minister.' That was in 1988 or thereabouts.

At any rate, Andrew Peacock wore these for 28 years. I think it is fair to say that he leaves the House with the good graces and support of all members. I do not think he had too many enemies and certainly none who would not wish him well. As he goes about his private life, I wish him well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in sending my best wishes to Andrew Peacock on his retirement from the House of Representatives. I do not think there is any doubt that, with the retirement of Andrew Peacock, the parliament has lost a fine parliamentarian&mdash;a member with a strong record of achievement in government. Perhaps above all, we will remember Andrew for being a good bloke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak as someone who worked for Andrew Peacock down in the bowels of the Department of Foreign Affairs when he was at the top as the foreign minister. When I was in my 20s, I worked for him as a political adviser when he was the Leader of the Opposition after the 1983 election; and, of course, I have worked with him as a member of parliament and in the shadow cabinet. To me, he has been a great friend, an ally and a confidante over many years. He has good friendships certainly on this side of the House, but I think even the Labor Party would concede in a moment of private candour that he has good friendships on the other side of the House as well. We have all enjoyed his private company, and I think that will be very much missed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew was a formidable politician who took the battle to his political opponents. He possessed great fighting qualities on the campaign trail. He was one of the very substantial parliamentary debaters of the past 20 or so years. He combined an extensive knowledge of the standing orders with a great sense of humour, as the Prime Minister pointed out, and a powerful way with words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew Peacock can look back on his record as a minister of the Crown with satisfaction. Members of the House and others will remember him in particular for his role in the foreign affairs portfolio where both his style and his substance served Australia's interests well. As the Prime Minister pointed out, the important part that he played in the independence of Papua New Guinea when he was foreign minister is seen as a high point of his career. He had very close relations with many, if not all, of the leading figures of that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He made many other great contributions as foreign minister, particularly to the evolution of Australian policy during the global debates of the late 1970s and the early 1980s on how to respond to the demands of the Third World, the North-South dialogue and the new international economic order. In those debates, Andrew Peacock was well ahead of his time, and the reorientation of Australian policy that he achieved has been an enduring one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also played a very significant role in raising Australia's profile in foreign affairs in the Asia-Pacific region. It was he, amongst others, who was instrumental in ensuring that Australia's foreign policy priority was its own region. This is not a new development; this is something that people like Andrew Peacock, when he was foreign minister, worked hard at in years gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew was a great Liberal who served his party twice as its leader. Over recent years, his long experience, sensible advice and practical involvement benefited this side of the House enormously. His Liberal beliefs were deeply held and applied to the circumstances of his time. His 1983 Deakin lecture on a Liberal approach to change will stand as one of his most powerful and definitive statements of belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Liberal Party are indebted to Andrew for his long and distinguished contribution to our party and the political process in Australia. We wish him well in the future. We know that he will enjoy more time with his family and we know that he will enjoy a great deal more time studying the racing form and supporting his beloved Essendon Football Club. Judging by its performance this year, it needs a great deal more support&mdash;not that I am mocking it; the Crows did not do very well this year. Nevertheless, next year the Essendon Football Club can look forward to even more enthusiastic support from Andrew Peacock than he was able to provide this year. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XS4">Dr LAWRENCE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I think it is very important that we all recognise this first National Breast Cancer Day and recognise the very clear importance of the early detection of breast cancer. It is why there has been such a concerted effort by state and federal governments alike to ensure high levels of funding and a five-year program which will see all women over 50 being screened every two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, after the first three years, we have seen some 604,000 women being screened for breast cancer. But, with some 6,000 Australian women being diagnosed every year with breast cancer, clearly there is no room for complacency. We are very keen to continue with this screening program, amongst other measures. The Commonwealth will be giving an extra $236 million or so over the next five years to ensure that we reach that target of one million women being screened every two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore very disappointing to me to discover from the recent Victorian health budget that we are not getting that commitment from at least one state government. Given the rhetoric, it is very disappointing indeed. I think it is important that these matters be drawn to the attention of the public. The public expect joint effort between the Commonwealth and the states, and the other states have been doing the right thing. Victoria has been offered $9.2 million to ensure screening. It was supposed to match that but it is falling short by over $2 million, with the result that over 40,000 Victorian women will not have the screening services that otherwise would be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is most important on this first National Breast Cancer Day that I draw the attention of the public to this matter and say to the people of Victoria: put pressure on your government to match the funds that are available in other states for screening purposes. That is perfectly reasonable. All Australian women expect and deserve that sort of service. It is a day for ensuring that people match the rhetoric with the reality. Withdrawing $2 million from screening programs in Victoria is a disgrace.</PARA>

When you have the stewardship of something that has been losing a great deal of money and you have brought in a due diligence process, the last thing you want is a change of any material circumstance in the business&mdash;say, an investment running into tens of millions of dollars&mdash;until such time as you have been able to report back to the government on the outcome of the study.

<PARA>In that particular document&mdash;which, as I said, created such enormous mirth and amusement for the Leader of the Opposition but not half as much as for everybody else&mdash;there is clearly absent a point that the government has been doing something about for some considerable time. Evidently, it escaped the drafters of those particular propositions that the government had cut the company tax rate to 33 per cent, put in place a changed development allowance and a general investment allowance and accelerated depreciation arrangements, included in the One Nation statement, et cetera. There has been a very considerable effort on the part of this government to improve the climate for business investment over the last couple of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite evident from the statistics that are coming through that the government in that area has been largely successful. Investment by private enterprises in new equipment was 13.4 per cent higher in the June quarter than in the March quarter, according to the national accounts. The latest June quarter capital expenditure survey also shows that strong growth in capital expenditure is expected to continue throughout 1994-95. Based on that survey and other factors such as strong business confidence, growing capacity utilisation and robust company profits, the budget forecast of 14 1/2 per cent growth is well and truly on target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is also information from other surveys. For example, the latest Pacific Power and Access Economics' investment monitor recorded a nine per cent increase in value of projects under construction or committed. That in turn was a result of an increase of nearly 50 per cent in the value of projects committed. The biannual survey by the Business Council of Australia released in May strongly supports the budget forecast of a rise in business investment. Sixty per cent of the survey respondents expected to increase their investment by more than 10 per cent and about 45 per cent of the survey respondents expected to increase investment by more than 20 per cent. The June quarter ACCI-Westpac business survey reports that the net balance of manufacturers planning an increase in plant and equipment investment over the next 12 months is at its second highest level for more than five years.</PARA>

That is a highly misleading way of looking at the question. It fails to take proper account of the structural features of our system in comparison with those of other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, it is fortuitous that the ANU has just released a study by Professor Gruen, Dr Deborah Mitchell and Professor Ann Harding which compares the social security systems of Australia and nine other developed countries. What it had to say makes very interesting reading indeed. It makes the point that you cannot just look at the totality of outlays; you have also to look at the efficiency of the social security systems of different countries at getting the assistance to those who actually need it. The people who produced this study reached the conclusion that, of the 10 countries studied, we have easily the most efficient system of getting the dollars to those who need it. To a very considerable extent, that offsets any difference in the totality of outlays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effectiveness of our social security system in preventing poverty is high and has increased significantly over the 1980s, largely as a consequence of the emphasis that we have placed on achieving a highly targeted system that is very efficient not only in getting money to those who need it, but also in terms of administrative costs as a proportion of total transfer outlays, in which respect we have the second most efficient system. So a great deal has been achieved in both those areas.</PARA>

The agreement is very important. I think what it represents is the reality that the philosophy of regional development, which was outlined in the Working Nation statement earlier this year, is now being translated not only through the Latrobe Valley in Gippsland but in regions right around Australia.

Given that the government has already decided the future of ANL by way of its grubby deal with the Maritime Union of Australia, does he still propose to pay $300,000 of taxpayers' funds to Mr Wran and Mr Turnbull to advise him on what to do with it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This shows what a dreadfully poor understanding you have, what a terrible shallowness there is in your understanding of what needs to be done at ANL in order to make it profitable. The fact is, as I indicated in the House this afternoon, that the task facing Mr Wran and his fellow directors for the next five months is a crucially important one because the concessions given last Monday night will fall far short of guaranteeing that ANL has a viable future. It still needs to be vitally and completely restructured. That is the task facing Mr Wran, Mr Turnbull and their associates, and they will continue that task over the next five months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can. Late last week the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission issued a new code of practice for lead levels in blood for those 8,000 workers in Australia who work in the lead industry. There have been a number of significant advances here. The first, through cooperation with the states, the Commonwealth and the territories, is to set a new uniform blood lead level for all workers in that industry. The second, which is more important, is to lower the acceptable lead levels in blood for all workers. Thirdly, and quite distinctively, women were never allowed to work in this industry and be exposed at all to lead levels, which was a peculiar form of discrimination in the sense that they were not given the opportunity. We now find we are able to differentiate the risks between men and women such that women can, within given guidelines, work in lead-risk parts of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very sensitive, though, to those women who may be of reproductive age, pregnant or in the process of breastfeeding in that very careful levels of lead in the blood have been set for them such that they can be withdrawn at any stage from lead-risk areas. It does not deny them, however, the right to work in those areas and the right of all workers to be checked on a regular basis for lead. The object is to allow men and women to work more safely in the lead industry and to progressively ensure that men and women take up jobs in this industry that tend to be risk free. I thank the state and territory governments for their cooperation in ensuring better and safer standards for men and women in the lead industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is with the Commonwealth, state and territory governments for failing to adequately fund our nation's primary schools to ensure that no child is deprived of the opportunity to fully participate in society because of inadequate skills in literacy and numeracy. For a very long time, I have argued in front of this parliament and in many other places that our school systems are failing our youth and failing the future of our country because of their failure to adequately prepare all&mdash;that is, 100 per cent&mdash;of our young people with the skills that they need to fully participate in modern society. We all know that society is becoming more complex and more technological and that entry into it demands increasing skills, including the ability of individuals to be able to read and write in English and to be able to compute&mdash;to add, subtract, multiply and divide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In 1992, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training tabled a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge: strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children</EMPHASIS>, which has become the bible of literacy sources for Australia for the past two years. In one section of that report we dealt with the issue of resources. It is that issue that I wish to largely address today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We stated that it is essential that the beginnings of education&mdash;the years which provide the foundations for further learning&mdash;receive increased resourcing. The committee does not accept the assumptions implied as a justification for the differential funding of the various education sectors. In essence, on a bipartisan basis, 100 per cent of the members of that committee believed, and still believe today, that our funding of primary schools per child, being less than our funding for secondary schools per child, is inadequate and inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is true that little people have little voices. So little voices sometimes get lost in the clamour for funds, exciting new technology and new resources. Our committee expected that one reason we have historically always funded secondary students at a higher level than primary students is that little people have smaller voices. Parents may not realise what inadequacies there may be in the education of their young children of five, six or seven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee found that all over the nation there is an understanding that, if by age seven, or grade 3, young children do not grasp the fundamentals of literacy and English, do not have a full command of the English language and have no additional assistance, they will be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. These children are placed at the risk of future failure. The numbers that we came up with are absolutely frightening. Somewhere between 20 and 25 per cent of the young student population of Australia may be at risk of failure because of inadequate literacy skills. Our committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also apparent that secondary students are more visible and vocal and therefore attract more attention. It is easier to recognise when the older students are "out of step". It appears to the Committee that our youngest children are almost invisible.</PARA>
<PARA>It is absolutely our duty to ensure that our young children receive the basic grounding and the basics of education that will serve them for the rest of their lives. It is certainly true that one will have a great deal of difficulty in studying history if one cannot read. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditionally, positions in the primary sector have been the domain of women and have been viewed as positions of caring or a second job. As with all organisations consisting primarily of women, junior primary schools are marginalised when it comes to the allocation of resources. The Committee was told that the power and bureaucracy appears to be dominated by people who are not in the K-6 areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The government responded to our report. We recommended that over a period of three years we gradually increase the resources to primary schools so that the per child funding is equal to&mdash;or approximately equal to&mdash;the funding for secondary students. Government members responded to our recommendations by saying that they would conduct a review&mdash;one more review into a sector that has been under constant review since anyone can remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that we no longer have any data about how bad the situation is. While the requirements for high literacy standards are constantly increasing, we have no accurate data regarding the entirety of the young student groupings across Australia. But government members say that they will undertake another inquiry. They also said that an agreement was being reached between the Commonwealth and the teaching profession, through its teaching unions, for an accord to advance the quality of teaching and learning, which will assist in addressing some of the problems in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge: strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no mention in the Commonwealth's report of doing anything about the curriculum in the universities and about teaching teachers how to teach young students how to read, which is certainly the crux of the problem. Our committee maintains that part of the problem is the lack of funding in the basic years to make certain that every child has a proper grounding on how to read, write and count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in 1985 the Commonwealth's contribution to primary and secondary funding, while demonstrably less than that of the states&mdash;the Commonwealth says that it is largely a problem of the states&mdash;was $225 per primary school student and $319 per secondary school student; that is, 41 per cent more in the secondary years than in the primary years. But, in 1994, the funding for those in their secondary school years had gone up to 90 per cent more than the funding for those in their primary school years. So the Commonwealth government has not responded to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge: strategies for early intervention for literacy and learning for Australian children</EMPHASIS> and has not responded to our request for increased funding for the early years of schooling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, an education committee in Victoria commissioned by minister Don Hayward, under the chair of Professor Brian Caldwell of Melbourne University, made a number of findings in Victoria's consideration of how to fund schools under its schools of the future program, which essentially gives global funding for those schools ready to take responsibility for their own funding, for their own distribution of funds and for how they spend funds in order to achieve high quality education outcomes. In essence, that report by Professor Caldwell said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More primary school students would be at risk of becoming illiterate adults unless governments increased funding in line with that for secondary schools.</PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was time federal and State governments reviewed their funding priorities to ensure the learning needs of primary school children were adequately addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The professor of education said he feared more students would join the bottom classes of the school population if governments did not move to resolve such funding inequities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the committee goes on to recommend not cutting funding for secondary schools and not absolutely guaranteeing that all the years of primary schools have the same funding as that in secondary, but that at least the early years of primary school receive substantial increased resourcing over the next several years so that we can make sure we get the basics right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is like a tree. If there is no foundation, if there is nowhere for the roots to grab hold, how on earth will the tree grow? It is the same for our nation's children. We can have all the sophisticated curriculum in the world, we can offer them all the modern scientific aids and all the educational assistance that is possible, we can buy the highest degree of modern technology and put it in place in our classrooms, but if we do not teach them how to read and write we will fail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate today to bring to the notice of this House the actions of the New South Wales coalition government, which I believe is violating the principles of federalism and short changing and deceiving the electorate of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter because last week we saw the Liberal Treasurer of New South Wales bring down a budget transparently designed, I believe, to curry favour with the electorate. This budget was designed to be everything for everybody&mdash;higher spending and no tax increases. But when we look behind what I feel are the most deceiving mirror tricks, we find a budget of deception, the misuse of federal government grants and a cheap, desperate gamble to try to win the March 1995 New South Wales election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, last year the federal government provided for New South Wales the sum of $51.8 million in road funding. I was shocked to see in the New South Wales budget for 1993-94 that the state government had diverted a significant amount of funding away from roads. In fact, the amount the Fahey government had diverted was&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;$51.8 million, the exact amount that the federal government had allocated for expenditure on roads. I assure the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) that this is factual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, thankfully, the New South Wales coalition government has given a commitment&mdash;after, I might add, a very public voice campaign by the Local Government and Shires Association&mdash;that this year's federal government roads allocation of some $103 million will not be accompanied by diversion of an equal amount of state funding from roads within New South Wales. The Fahey government unfortunately has given this commitment&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;for one year only, election year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an example of deception for which I believe the New South Wales coalition has become famous. My mind goes back to when the then government gave a commitment to the people of New South Wales that a $60 a year Water Board environmental levy would be spent cleaning up the state's rivers. The levy raised approximately $100 million in the first year. The government then took $100 million from the Water Board for consolidated revenue and had the audacity to claim that it was a different $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the then chairman of the Water Board resigned in disgust at the government's action. I believe that the state lost a very hardworking and committed person in David Harley&mdash;a person, I might add, who was appointed by the coalition and who we always thought was committed to its principles. But he was, as proven by his action, a highly principled person who resigned when that step was taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another tax that has been implemented in New South Wales by that government: the 3x3 road tax. I believe that the Fahey government has abused the goodwill and public trust by effectively diverting federal road funding to other areas. The New South Wales government is crying out for more money for roads and is claiming that it must continue to impose a tax of 3c per litre for its roads program, and then it has the hide to effectively divert its federal government grants from those same roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look around my electorate and see all the great work that has been done with our federal government road funding&mdash;especially the black spots program&mdash;it certainly makes my blood boil to think that the state government can continue to divert funding, provided by our federal government, from roads. The New South Wales government could find enough money to shamefully pork barrel the Parramatta by-election to the tune of some $1.5 billion but then found it desirable to divert funding from roads. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member points out, the Liberal Party got a rude shock in the Parramatta by-election&mdash;a swing of some 10 per cent to the Labor candidate who won that election, Gabrielle Harrison. I congratulate her. I would have thought that our Liberal coalition would have learnt its lesson in that by-election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Parramatta showed a sophistication and an intelligence that obviously surprised Premier John Fahey. But he seems to think that he will get away with a con job on a state wide level. I do not know why. I think the basic premise of federal-state financial relations is the fact that federal grants are meant to supplement state funding of particular government activities. I believe that the President of the New South Wales Shires Association, Wal Mitchell, explained the situation admirably when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The credibility of the state government in making claims on the Commonwealth Government for additional funds will become a charade if this duplicitous action continues.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that Mr Mitchell has hit it in one. After every COAG meeting the premiers&mdash;John Fahey is one of the loudest&mdash;claim that the federal government has sold them out. John Fahey's words will be hollow indeed, when he has sponsored a deceitful action such as this. The state governments keep asking for more untied grants, but when they behave like this, undermining the Commonwealth's program to give money to New South Wales roads, they show that they really cannot be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me, I would like to comment briefly on the other fiscal deception by that state government: the proposal for a referendum next year which would enshrine a balanced budget, an idea of which Joh Bjelke-Petersen would certainly have been proud. This is deceptive on a number of fronts&mdash;and let not the people be fooled. Firstly, the New South Wales parliament has the power to entrench clauses in the New South Wales constitution without recourse to a referendum. So, if the government really wants to go down this path, it could merely put the proposal to a vote in the New South Wales parliament. Secondly, it is well known that the budget sector is only one part of the government expenditure and revenue and governments can expand and contract what constitutes the budget sector for its own accounting purposes. Thirdly, as the Fahey government knows, this is voodoo economics at its worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State budget deficits are a perfectly acceptable weapon of management within the right circumstances. The Fahey government should know this better than most because, despite all of the callous cutbacks which New South Wales has experienced since 1988, it still runs a budget deficit. As the Professor of Accounting at the University of New South Wales, Bob Walker, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase between 1988 and 1993 of $7.5 billion is arguably the largest growth in liabilities in the history of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>Surprise, surprise! Who was in power in New South Wales during this time? It was the Liberal coalition government. In 1988, after the Curran report, the incoming ministers were wandering around saying what a disgrace it was that the level of state liabilities was so high, and they have presided over the largest increase in liabilities in that state's history! Hypocrisy is a common theme running through that government&mdash;hypocrisy on road funding, hypocrisy on budget deficits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fahey government has treated its electors with contempt&mdash;and it will meet the fate it deserves when obliged to go to election in March 1995. I condemn particularly the actions it has taken so readily and so openly, having seen at first-hand the problems associated with road funds being deviated to other areas. As I have said in this grievance debate today, well do we remember the commitment which was given: we have all continued to pay that water board levy in the belief that moneys raised would be used to clean up the rivers. In fact, there was a private members debate here today on the River Murray. If we do not watch it, there will be many more problems within the state of New South Wales because of the irresponsible leadership and, more particularly, the irresponsible government which has imposed on the state of New South Wales one of the highest debt servicing liabilities it has had. I condemn the government for that action. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We learn from the report that, so serious was this act of sabotage, it hindered our own intelligence agencies in their attempts to investigate the attack two years ago on the Iranian embassy. We were told by the auditor that the DILGEA mainframe computer had shut down for `unexplained reasons' just 10 minutes before a public servant tried to get information on possible suspects. Evidence given in a recent magistrates court case in Canberra points to the fact that the saboteur could be the intelligence service of a hostile foreign power. These matters, both the system of capturing information and the act of sabotage, cannot be separated. They are intimately linked and concern the apparent lack of security involving the keeping and handling of records of the millions of people who enter and leave Australia each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns arise from a document produced by the Crown in recently completed court proceedings in the Canberra magistrates court. This document proves that a senior officer of the Australian National Audit Office conducting the DILGEA audit became so concerned about the actions of certain DILGEA staff that he sought to have them charged with criminal offences. Subsequently I have learnt that the auditor, Mr David Berthelsen, wanted the staff charged with imposition upon the Commonwealth, under section 29B of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Paragraph 15 of the document, supported by a minute prepared by Mr Berthelsen to his executive director in the audit office of 25 February 1993, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on my investigation of allegations against DILGEA is close to completion and could indicate criminal conduct on the part of several persons and raise grave concerns in relation to possible access of Commonwealth government computers by a foreign power.</PARA>
<PARA>The question which must arise is why these grave allegations were not probed by the responsible Commonwealth investigatory authorities or why the parliament was not made aware of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in possession of a list of names of those DILGEA officers whose conduct Mr Berthelsen has sought to have the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions probe with a view to bringing criminal proceedings for imposition. I am also told that a company officer of the firm that benefited as a result of these cash advances was also under suspension and that a strong prima facie case particularly exists against this individual and the most senior of the DILGEA officers. I do not wish to name these people in this place but would be prepared to give their identities to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for appropriate further action. Other information which has come into my possession alludes to the fact that Mr Berthelsen, acting on the instruction of his superiors, was ordered to withdraw briefing material he had made over to the DPP. He was also, to my understanding, instructed to shred the same documents and all other copies of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the serious matter of national security and how it was impacted upon by what appears to have been a deliberate act of sabotage on DILGEA's electronic data collection processes, and how an ineffective DILGEA security system allowed the staff of an immigration data processing contractor to have unauthorised access to the DILGEA computer. This issue&mdash;which began with the awarding of the tender to process the data to a company trading as Keydata, the cash advances, and the apparent acts of sabotage&mdash;dates back to early January 1992, when DILGEA decided to use off-site private contracting as a means of processing incoming and outgoing passenger data. As a result, a private company was given data line links to the computer, thus providing an ideal opportunity for any would-be saboteur to engage in acts against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know now as a result of Auditor-General Taylor's report that, on 21 January 1992, within a week of Keydata receiving DILGEA approval to undertake the work, vital DILGEA computer system records disappeared. Auditor-General Taylor has also revealed that on that day, which was three months before the attack on the Iranian embassy, four hours of vital computer records were deliberately overwritten with a string of zeros. Information I have been given indicates that the data which was wiped from the 21 January tape may have identified who accessed the department's mainframe computer without authorisation, and the same persons could have loaded and activated the software which subsequently, three months later on 12 April, caused the system to crash. Clearly, off-site processing would have created the perfect window of opportunity for a would-be saboteur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now history that the attack on the Iranian embassy occurred on 6 April 1992, and that the sabotage of the DILGEA computer prevented an investigation from uncovering passenger movements involving suspected terrorists. A number of well placed sources who are aware of this matter are convinced that this sabotage was the work of a foreign intelligence service. It is a fact that the failure was detected just 10 minutes before an entry control officer attempted to retrieve data about persons suspected of being involved in the Iranian embassy raid which had occurred six days earlier. Australian security organisations were widely criticised at the time for their lack of coordination in allowing demonstrators to breach embassy security. Frankly, DILGEA also should be roundly criticised for its improper management of computer security affecting the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So serious are these issues that Auditor-General Taylor sought to have his suspicions of the compromising of the DILGEA computer probed by the Defence Signals Directorate. I am also advised that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation was separately approached by Mr Berthelsen and treated his concerns seriously. It appears that our national security has been compromised by a conspiracy involving senior DILGEA officers in their haste to shift computer processing to premises of a private contractor. Senior auditor Berthelsen's minute, which surfaced in the recent court action, indicates that there may have been a fraud committed upon the Commonwealth in the awarding of the work to an outside contractor. It also appears that a deliberate attempt was made by certain Commonwealth agencies to shield these issues from the taxpayer and this parliament by diverting attention to a costly and abortive criminal trial against a journalist and a public servant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters should be investigated by both the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Accounts and ASIO, without delay, with particular reference to circumstances involving  the  briefing  documents  Mr Berthelsen made over to the DPP and their subsequent shredding. I also believe that it is the role of the parliament to order material to be provided which would lead to the identification of the hostile foreign intelligence service which is alleged to have been involved. In conclusion, I seek leave to table the document and audit office minute from which I quoted earlier and which I did show to the previous minister at the table. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is for the people of New South Wales&mdash;much like the grievance made in the previous contribution by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). More specifically, I grieve for the young families of New South Wales, particularly those in south-west Sydney which includes my electorate of Macarthur. This area has thousands of young families comprising working parents with young children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young families are the people who depend on the quality, affordable child-care services which the federal Labor government is attempting to provide through our children's services program. But these families are being denied access to child-care services because of the mean and uncooperative attitude taken by the New South Wales Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that the children's services program is one of a number of joint Commonwealth-state funded programs in the human services area. Sadly, like most of the other joint Commonwealth-state programs, it has experienced major problems due to the intransigence and political obstructiveness of some state governments. There is no worse example of this than the situation with child-care funding in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade, since the election of the federal Labor government in 1983, the federal government has sought to work in cooperation with state and territory governments to dramatically expand the supply of child-care places. This began with the 1984 20,000 places strategy and continued with the 1988 national child-care strategy which provided an additional 30,000 child-care places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cost sharing arrangements applied in New South Wales to the long day care component of the 1984 20,000 places strategy in New South Wales and also to the long day care and occasional care components of the 1988 national child-care strategy. In New South Wales, additional family day care places and outside school hours care places under these strategies have received Commonwealth-only funding. Other states were involved in cost sharing for funding of outside school hours care services, but New South Wales was exempted from this requirement in recognition of its contribution to the capital cost of new centres under these two strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1988 budget papers the federal government announced funding for the additional 30,000 places in the national child-care strategy. The total number of additional places funded in New South Wales under the 1988 strategy was 9,810&mdash;that is: 6,760 outside school hours care; 1,360 family day care; 1,020 long day care; and 670 occasional care places. However, unbelievably, of the 1,020 long day care places in the 1988 strategy, some 400 places are still not operational. Of the 670 occasional care places, less than half are operational. I understand that this outrageous situation is a result of a combination of lengthy bureaucratic delays at state government level and some hold-ups with development and/or building approvals at local council level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is not bad enough, let us look at the 1992-96 national child-care strategy. Continuing efforts to negotiate cost sharing arrangements with the New South Wales government for this strategy are still unsuccessful. Former Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, announced in the 1990 election campaign that the federal government would extend the national child-care strategy by a further 50,000 places over the six-year period from 1990-91 to 1995-96. This is what is now known as the 1992-96 national child-care strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a meeting with state and territory ministers on 10 August 1990, the then minister, the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), indicated that New South Wales's share of these extra 50,000 places would be 16,840. That is 9,840 for outside school hours care, 3,500 for family day care, and 3,500 for long day care places, which was the original offer. It was also indicated that future outside school hours care places would be funded on a `year round care' basis, that is, including vacation care as well as before and after school care as part of a package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's initial approach to New South Wales envisaged that funding costs for the new strategy would be shared as follows. For long day care, New South Wales would be asked to pay 100 per cent of capital costs and the Commonwealth would fund recurrent expenditure, such as operational assistance, fee relief and the New South Wales salary subsidy. For outside school hours care, the Commonwealth would fund 100 per cent of capital equipment and 70 per cent of recurrent expenditure, with New South Wales to pay the other 30 per cent of recurrent expenditure. For family day care, both capital equipment and recurrent expenditure would be 100 per cent Commonwealth funded. On 1991-92 prices it was estimated that this approach would cost New South Wales about $52 million in capital expenditure over a six-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Commonwealth's initial approach to all states, the Special Premiers Conference in late 1990 decided to review Commonwealth-state roles in a number of human services areas, including child care. A working party of officials was established in early 1991 to conduct a functional review of child care. Unfortunately, while the Commonwealth's offer of additional places to start in 1990-91 remained on the table, all states&mdash;including New South Wales&mdash;refused to enter into serious bilateral negotiations while the review was under way. Of course, this did not stop the New South Wales Liberal government from attempting to mislead the public about child-care funding just before the 1991 state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an outrageous stunt the then Premier, Nick Greiner, released a statement three days before the election on 25 May entitled `Major Greiner Government Commitment to Child Care' which claimed that his government would create 10,000 new child-care places. However, after questioning, it was revealed that this was nothing more than a reannouncement of the 10,000 places in the federal government's 1988 child-care strategy&mdash;some of which, as I have already said, are still not operational. It was also revealed by the then federal minister, the honourable member for Jagajaga, that the New South Wales government was refusing to sign the new agreement which would deliver the 16,840 places in the 1992-96 child-care strategy. So the hypocrisy of the New South Wales government on child care was well and truly exposed just before the last state election back in May 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have another state election next year. What do we find? Suddenly, the New South Wales government announced in its budget last week a lousy $1 million for 1994-95, plus $10 million for 1995-96 for capital works on child care. There is an election coming up, so it wants to be seen to be making an effort. Of course, it is nowhere near enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that the New South Wales government still has not signed the agreement. The young families of New South Wales are still being denied access to over 17,000 child-care places because of the New South Wales Liberal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The functional review of child care in 1991 was abortive. The working party was unable to reach agreement. In any case, the planned Special Premiers Conference of 1991&mdash;remember that?&mdash;which was due to consider a report from that review did not occur due to a boycott by state premiers. The Commonwealth attempted to resume bilateral negotiations with all states in early 1992. A set of proposed principles for the 1992-96 national strategy was considered at the April 1992 meeting of the Council of Social Welfare Ministers. These principles were endorsed by those ministers `as a basis for further bilateral negotiations to be finalised by end May 1992'. However, the New South Wales government, significantly, decided to reserve its position on this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the social welfare ministers meeting, bilateral cost sharing agreements were negotiated and signed between the Commonwealth, the ACT, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia, that is, all states and territories except New South Wales and Victoria. The first of these agreements, with Queensland, was signed on 25 August 1992. Of course, in New South Wales we are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is of particular concern to me, coming from an electorate which contains some of the fastest growing parts of Australia, with half of the population under the age of 20 in some areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government was so concerned at this situation that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) wrote to the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, in August 1993 requesting the New South Wales government's urgent cooperation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance this afternoon is about the political stunt being perpetrated by this Commonwealth government on the farming community of Australia. There has been a totally inadequate response from this government to the severe drought being experienced by most of rural Australia today. It is important to note that in some areas the drought is into its fourth year, and we have just seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visit affected parts of Queensland, and just prior to that some affected parts of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to this problem to date has been minimal. While it has been left to organisations such as the Smith Family and other welfare and community groups, and public donations from some areas of Victoria, the government has continued to talk big and deliver little. A little later I want to talk about a couple of community groups that have got together and raised funds to help the drought stricken. We await this week a major announcement from this government, which I think will be delivered on Wednesday. The government has been aware of this ever increasing problem for several years now. It has been aware that the RAS has not been effective at all. Yet, as is typical of this government, it continues to talk big and deliver very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1989 under the Hawke leadership, with the current Prime Minister as the then restless Treasurer, the government decided that droughts were no longer natural disasters and that drought relief policies should be passed from Treasury to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. In what amounted to a very strange government decision, in 1990 the McInnes report further declared that droughts were no longer random natural disasters. They became something the current Prime Minister believes that we just have to live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there this discrimination against drought as a natural disaster? The answer has not been given to date. Whilst natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, fires, hurricanes and blizzards continue to receive preferential treatment, for some reason the poor old drought has been singled out by this Prime Minister and government as being part of an individual farmer's responsibility and something that a farmer has to put up with as an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the current Prime Minister dispose of the drought relief policy from the Treasury in 1989? It seems very strange. The Prime Minister's flippant and irresponsible attitude towards drought has a history. His current comments are a continuation of the lip-service that we have seen from him throughout his 1,000 days as Prime Minister and his time as Treasurer prior to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Prime Minister, `The drought has caught you out.' There is unrest not just within the rural community but also within the broader community. The public is fully aware of the Prime Minister's inertia on this issue, and it is time to draw some important comparisons. Is it not telling that it has been the public of Australia that has had to institute relief measures on its own? The people of Victoria sent fodder from Geelong to New South Wales and all points north. Television and radio personalities have raised money&mdash;a great example being Channel 9's farmhand appeal concert which raised more than $4 million. Welfare organisations are also taking collections for drought relief. The Smith Family has contributed over $50,000 directly to drought relief. The reasons for these public collections are clearly due to the absence of clear government leadership on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it not also telling to see the relative priority given to overseas aid in this year's budget&mdash;I think overseas aid received an eight per cent increase&mdash;when a significant number of Australian farmers are suffering on the breadline? This has been a four-year drought, and the government must have been fully aware of the problems in rural and regional Australia well before this year's budget was put together. Is it not telling that the Prime Minister has proposed $150 million worth of cosmetic changes to the Sydney Harbour scene, with the removal of the Cahill Expressway and given them a higher priority than the 83 per cent of New South Wales that remains seriously drought declared?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, is it not telling that the government jumped to attention within 48 hours to strike a comprehensive deal with the Maritime Union of Australia whilst the four-year drought that has ravaged eastern Australia has been left to its own devices, as `something that we just have to live with,' to quote the Prime Minister's words?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the government's answer to the drought problem so far? Basically, it has relied heavily on the rural adjustment scheme to solve its headaches. However, since the legislative changes of 1990 to the rural adjustment scheme, the RAS has proved totally inadequate in the first real drought since the amendments were made. Extended droughts of four or more years duration are manifestly beyond the  competence of the government's present legislation to handle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RAS, to which the McInnes task force was fatally attracted, has been in operation in various guises since 1970-71. It is principally a means by which low interest credit and grants can be provided to farmers who meet relevant criteria. It is fair to say now, with the benefit of hindsight, that the recommendation of the McInnes task force that drought mitigation be incorporated in the RAS was flawed, and affected farmers have been highly critical of its administration. The detailed and unrealistic exceptional circumstances provisions of the scheme have also proved particularly inflexible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current drought is not only a natural disaster but also an administrative disaster by this government. Surely it is time to recognise drought as a natural disaster and find a far more accommodating way of dealing with it than via the RAS. If this government continues with its current policies, it will be the cruellest of cruel hoaxes on rural Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for this reason that the coalition has developed a significant drought relief package that overcomes many of these hurdles. The three Rs package of relief, retention and recovery are important steps in the development of a genuine drought relief package. The coalition recognises the stupidity of the current approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the priorities in terms of the three Rs&mdash;relief, retention and recovery. Relief means fair access to help for the necessities, for the groceries on the table and for education. Retention means retaining farmers and as much as possible of their productive infrastructure, including their breeding flocks and herds. Finally, there is recovery. The drought will not end when the first rains come. Recovery in many areas and for many farmers will be slow and painful, and they will be in need of government support through that process. </PARA>

They and the community in general should be congratulated for having the foresight to run the auction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I move on to the subject of my grievance, I will make one small comment to the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) about his criticism of the federal government. One of the things the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did was to announce that the government would match dollar for dollar all the money that was raised on the Channel 9 farm appeal. So the $4 million that was raised on that telephone appeal will be matched by $4 million from the federal government. Moreover, all donations to the Smith Family for the drought appeal are tax deductible; therefore the government is supporting the appeal in that respect as well. I suggest that the honourable member wait till he sees the size and proportions of the package that will be put forward on Wednesday.

I am sorry to do that because the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), is a good friend of mine and is a very good minister. I am sure that once I have pointed out this particular problem to him, he will respond very quickly and correct it. I think it is important that this matter be raised in the House and that we seek some urgent action on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem relates to widows of war veterans who failed to make the change, or failed to be notified comprehensively of the fact that they could switch, from being on a half rate Department of Veterans' Affairs pension to a single rate Department of Social Security pension. You might ask: what does it matter which department pays? It can mean a difference of up to $30 a week in income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that at the time the death occurs the department informs the widow that it will assist with bereavement costs, with the funeral expenses. At the same time, it informs the widow that if she so chooses she can make the changeover. For a lot of people that particular moment in their life is a very tragic set of circumstances so they are not particularly focusing on their pension or on making changes. In a lot of cases, they are women in their 70s or 80s who have not had to worry about applying to the DVA, or had very little if any contact with it, because that was something their husbands did&mdash;in most cases the husband was the war veteran. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of them do know what they are doing, are aware they have a choice and deliberately choose to stay with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. One reason could be they like the Department of Veterans' Affairs, know the staff well and are comfortable with that department. Another reason they choose to stay on a DVA pension could be that they wish to access health care through the Repatriation Commission and the repatriation hospitals. But a lot of people are not making the change because they do not know they are eligible for it. It can amount to more than $30 a week, as I indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem was raised with me by one of my constituents, Mr Wally McMahon of Sunnybank, who found out about the difference in pension rates which affected his mother-in-law. His mother-in-law had been in receipt of a half rate married Department of Veterans' Affairs pension since her husband passed away in the middle of last year. She did not realise that there was anything unusual about it until she started talking to some of her acquaintances in her social circle at the local bowls club. They informed her they were on a totally different rate of pension and were in fact getting $30 a week more than she was. She was a woman who did not have a lot of other means to support herself, who did not have any other source of income, so a difference of $30 a week was quite substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When she contacted the department she found out that yes, she could apply and make the changeover but it was up to her to make that change. The department indicated that it had actually written to her at the time of her husband's death and because she failed to respond took no further action. When I found out about this, I contacted the Department of Veterans' Affairs to find out what the situation was. I listed this as a question on notice so I could find out how many widows were in this situation of being on half rate married DVA pensions. I found out that there are over 3,800 women around Australia&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are 3,800 women around Australia who are on the half rate DVA pension when they are entitled to be on the single rate pension from the Department of Social Security. I think that a large number of those women, if they were informed they had the capacity to make the change, would make that change and seek to be on the higher rate of pension. It is their entitlement and they have forgone a lot of income for a long period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to ensure that each and every one of those 3,800 women is written to in clear, plain, simple language to explain what their entitlements are. I also suggest there be a reply paid form with that letter so they can indicate that they understand the information and that yes, they wish to apply for the single rate of pension from DSS or no, they wish to stay on the DVA pension. That information should be kept separate from other things widows are advised of at the time of their husband's death. It should be done totally separately a few weeks after the event when people have had a chance to settle their affairs and put their minds to such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to write to all of those people, to find out how many of them are willing to switch over and to assist those women make the switch over to the Department of Social Security pension. As I said, not all of them will choose to do so but they should be allowed to make an informed decision and an informed choice with all the information placed before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I would like to talk about very briefly is the question of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. Yesterday the minister announced the successful tenderer for the purchase of the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. The Ramsay Health Care Group, the hospital group which has purchased the Hollywood Repatriation Hospital in Perth, is the successful tenderer for the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. My congratulations go to Paul Ramsay and the Ramsay group for their successful tender. I congratulate them also on the package of proposals they have put forward for renovating and rejuvenating the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a very strong concern for the veterans and war widows of my electorate and those of Brisbane who use this hospital and value it greatly. I am reassured by Paul Ramsay that the Ramsay group will maintain absolutely first-class service for all of those people and will ensure that the quality of health care that war widows and war veterans receive at Greenslopes is the best that is available. I certainly hope that will be the case. I am also reassured that the hospital will be an even better place with the injection of an additional $8 million of capital works being funded by the Ramsay group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that decision has been made because there was a lot of uncertainty amongst the staff and amongst war service people in my electorate about what was going to happen to the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. I am assured the hospital will maintain its name; it will continue to be the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. It will maintain a first-rate service for war widows and war veterans. It will continue to be an important facility in my electorate in looking after the needs of all returned service personnel who are eligible to receive hospital treatment there. Again, I congratulate the Ramsay group on its successful tender. I also congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs for the manner in which he has handled that decision. I hope that he is able to respond quickly to my concerns about the widows and their pensions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak about the drought that is unfolding in Australia and in particular about the real attitude of the federal Labor Party towards this drought notwithstanding the recent discovery by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when he went to Queensland to see just how devastating the drought has been on a number of families, of how it is absolutely destroying families' lives, destroying local communities and giving people such little hope.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note in the business section of this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> some very interesting and rather different views are being expressed about the effect the drought will have on Australia. It is very hard not to believe that the government did not have a very big influence on what was written in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week. The opening comments state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perverse as it may sound, the crippling NSW and Queensland drought may have delivered just what the federal Treasurer, Ralph Willis, needed: a timely brake on a potentially overheated economy.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems when we look at the effects of the drought on business we see what the government is really thinking. This article goes on to mention some Canberra views from a couple of sources. There is also mention that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, which is one of the government's own bodies, is expected to announce its revised estimates on the value of farm exports later this month. The article interestingly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the value will be down from last year's $19 billion, government sources&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note `government sources'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">indicate the drop may be far less than $1 billion, possibly about $500 million.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the member for Murray interjects, the loss in wheat alone will be well over $1 billion. This article demonstrates the government's real attitude towards country people, towards the farming community and towards those rural towns which have been suffering so much under this severe and prolonged drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad conclusion is that there is an obvious attempt in this article, through the government's sources and the references to the Treasurer (Mr Willis), to downgrade the significance of those being affected by the drought. In other words, the impression is given that they are really second-class citizens. It seems the real agenda was set by the Prime Minister's earlier remarks when he suggested that drought was just a normal part of farming. What I find equally amazing in this article is the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such expectations give Willis the heart to stick by budget forecasts for growth of about 4.5%.</PARA>
<PARA>Again it reinforces this extraordinary attempt by the government to indicate that it might even have planned this drought as a way of making sure that its forecasts for the overall economy are going to be met. But what is really frightening is that the government shows an incredible ignorance about the ongoing effect of a drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the very real difference between this drought and the 1982-83 drought, when most farmers were in a slightly better position than they are today to withstand a drought. Farmers have now been through the recession we had to have, through the crippling interest rate regime that the Prime Minister imposed on this country, and have basically been weakened in most cases by some very low commodity prices, particularly in the wool industry. It is really only at the very bottom of the article that we find any reference to the longer term impact that this drought is going to have in the loss of wheat markets and in the loss of some very good beef markets that have been opened up in Japan and Korea, and the fact that down the track it could have a very major impact on the ability of the wool growing industry to sustain itself two or three years hence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I find the whole attitude expressed in this article frightening. If it is a reflection of the government, then the government ought to be condemned because clearly it shows that it has consigned country people to second-rate citizenship. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;On behalf of the National Party of Australia, I salute Andrew Peacock, who ultimately resigned late on Saturday night, on the service he has given to the parliament. I am delighted that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), as father of the House, will also be speaking, as will one or two other members. Andrew Peacock was a party leader for a very lengthy period. He held no fewer than four key portfolios in his own right: he held the portfolio of foreign affairs from 1975 to 1985; he held the portfolio of the environment, which people often overlook, for a brief period in 1975; he held the portfolio of external territories in 1972; and he was one of the last to hold the portfolio of the army, which he held from 1969 to 1972. He was in company with Bob Katter Sr, the then member for Kennedy, who was the very last Minister for the Army before the portfolios were restructured.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paying tribute to the work of Andrew Peacock, let me hasten to add that he is very much alive. Someone listening to the initial accolades which were given earlier this afternoon rang my office to see whether he had suddenly died. Andrew Peacock made a decision to step down as member for Kooyong and a long serving member of the House of Representatives. On a personal front, I add that he was a very genial companion around the circuit, but he did make a real contribution not only to the governance of Australia but also to the linkage of Australia with Papua New Guinea and Asia. Before it became fashionable and enjoyed the priority that it always deserved to enjoy, Andrew Peacock was building up links between Australia and Asia in the early days. Importantly, he provided the base for those subsequent developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute the work done by Andrew Peacock. I acknowledge that he went to Scots College in Melbourne, which I had reason to clash with on occasions as I went to school just down the road. I acknowledge that his tips in football and racing were sometimes lousy, but I equally acknowledge that Andrew Peacock gave his very best in representing the electors of Kooyong; in carrying out with diligence and some cut-through thinking the responsibilities of the portfolios which he held, especially that of foreign affairs; in speeding up the process of the independence of Papua New Guinea; and in helping to build a myriad of relations for Australia's sake. He did this not only through his role as Minister for Foreign Affairs but also through the many delegations that he led overseas. He also did this through work with the Pacific Democrat Union and subsequently the International Democrat Union, of which he was president for a lengthy period. Good luck, Andrew Peacock. Congratulations on a job well done!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It would not be appropriate for Andrew Peacock to exit this place without at least several contributions from this side of the House. I note that my colleague the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) is here with us and I suspect that something may be forthcoming from him in the course of the afternoon. This gentleman whose career we celebrate in our remarks is worth an hour or two of the parliament's time, but not in the context of a valedictory which requires us to be entirely reverential. He is still very much alive and, if we should wish to take a boot to him every now and again during our remarks, it would be entirely appropriate. Nevertheless, it ought to be done in the framework of a recognition of a well-structured career and a job well done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The British define the five great offices of state in the United Kingdom as the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Leader of the Opposition. We do not have a home secretary position in our system of government as we have states. Most of the tasks performed by the Home Secretary are performed by state governments. I note that Andrew Peacock held half of the four offices that the mother of all parliaments and the government based on it determine are the substantial offices of state to which all in politics ought to aspire at some point in their political careers. He held a few others, and those who have already spoken have pointed to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, Andrew was not averse to dropping hints on his retirement. In anticipation of his retirement, he became less and less discreet, particularly in the fortnight between when he told his party leader of his intention and when he ultimately chose to resign. I had the privilege of being regaled on the subject at a recent ministerial dinner. I said that I thought this was an unusual decision on his part and that I thought he would want to have left parliament as father of the House. He looked at me quizzically and pointed out that it had an occupant. He did not expect to live as long as it would take that occupant to leave the position. He can subsequently speak for himself and no doubt announce his intentions on that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been at various dinners trying to get rid of him and it all seems to have been without any success at all. Perhaps Andrew's judgment on that matter was as sound as his judgment has been in many other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, whilst his career was substantial, it must have had elements that gave him less satisfaction than it could have. It cannot have been his anticipation in political life that the last 12 years of his period as a parliamentarian would be spent in opposition. That was not the nature of politics at the time that he entered politics and it has not been the nature of politics in the entire history of Federation until this last 12 years. Given his substantial capabilities and the wonderful luxury of the seat that he held, a luxury which has been denied me the entirety of my parliamentary career, he would have anticipated at some point in time taking over the mantle of prime ministership. It was certainly anticipated by his revered leader of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though he spent much of his period in politics in opposition, he was a man of his times. Both sides of politics came to respect Andrew Peacock quite a bit in the late 1960s and 1970s. He was Minister for the Army who sat most uncomfortably with the policy of the age. He was not convinced that the best possible representation of Australian political interest internationally was served by continued commitment to the war in Vietnam. He must have been grateful that those tensions were resolved by Prime Minister Gorton when he began the process of phasing out Australia's military commitment to that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew Peacock clearly learned a great deal more when he visited Vietnam than was learned by the people who shared his type of position amongst the other allied forces engaged in it. As more and more emerges from the record in the United States, it is quite evident that more than a few of his ministerial contemporaries in that country also came to share his views. These were not views that he could publicly express in the Australian parliamentary context, apart from inside his organisation. The extent to which he did will not really be revealed for probably another few years, as it is determined by the extent to which there is some restriction upon all matters considered by government at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then presided over the first phase of the independence of Papua New Guinea. That is a personal triumph. It is a triumph that did not just reflect his views on wishing to create for himself a name in some aspect of endeavour prior to his going on to better things. Throughout the period of long Liberal Party and National Party government, by and large those who held the territories portfolio held it with a seriousness of intent and purpose that belied the extent to which they were ignored by most of their parliamentary colleagues during the period that they held it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent to which Andrew Peacock took it seriously was reflected by the fact that he persisted long after the issue had passed from his hands in efforts to ensure that the changes succeeded. One newspaper report noted that he has visited Papua New Guinea on no fewer than 54 occasions. That is an extraordinary level of personal commitment. It stands him in good stead and augments the significance of his achievements in that portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became foreign minister for a lengthy period of time. I guess that, with all his experience as a minister, judgments about his ministerial capabilities must stand or fall on what one thought of him as a foreign minister, because he served in other portfolios for not the length of time that would give one an opportunity to make judgments about them one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House would not concede that he is Australia's most substantial foreign minister. We think we have one of those wandering around in the position at the moment and another not bad one wandering around in an even more elevated position. We have more than a sneaking sympathy for Bert Evatt who also held that position. If we failed to mention Gough Whitlam, most of us would have our heads torn off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the Liberals have had a number of very good foreign ministers. Casey was one of them. He was a really outstanding foreign minister. Certainly if we take the period of time in which Andrew Peacock was foreign minister and in politics in the 1960s and 1970s, we will find that his contribution was substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had to handle a deeply wounded policy process. Whatever might be said about the rights or wrongs of Australia's participation in the Vietnam War, its corrosive effect upon the conduct of Australian foreign relations lasted for at least a decade after our involvement in it. It was a very difficult one to handle in the regional context and an extraordinarily difficult one to handle in the domestic political context. It was an era which required a lot of redefinition in relationships with old allies and in future commitments in the region, in which policy was seen in the 1960s not to have emerged as howlingly successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oddly enough, the difficulties that the society had in coming to grips with that outcome was reflected in many other areas of national activity at the time. For example, when I was a university student, we all did Asian studies. Asian studies virtually all but disappeared from students' interests in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Everybody felt that intellectually the area had been talked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it was a credit to Andrew Peacock as foreign minister that he kept developing a detailed policy direction towards the area. He had to compete with a Prime Minister who did not necessarily share his objectives and who certainly did not want to share any triumphs. Some of the feeling on that led him ultimately to resign from his position. One of the most dramatic moments I experienced as a new member of parliament was to sit in the chamber and see Andrew Peacock standing up at the back of the gathering and detailing to the parliament why he felt he could no longer successfully be a part of his Prime Minister's government. It was a performance which again did credit to the man. He deserves plaudits for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is a matter for the Liberal Party to make judgments about whether his period as Leader of the Opposition and his subsequent participation in opposition politics after the demise of the Fraser Liberal government suited the advancing of the interests of the coalition. There is no doubt that he did well in the 1984 election campaign in difficult circumstances. Personally&mdash;in the long haul it may not be possible for current coalition people to speculate on this&mdash;I think that the clashes between him and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) deprived the Liberal Party of credibility in experienced leadership. As a result, whoever may be at fault for that outcome has, at least on the opposition side of politics, damaged effective participation in national affairs. As I said, on this side of the House, who cares? On that side of the House, it is a matter that ought to be thought through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think, from the point of view of the nation, that we are necessarily well served by the disappearance of Mr Peacock from this place. There has developed a fairly silly view of national affairs that parliamentary careers are decade-long affairs and that members of parliament are encouraged to exit parliament and make pots of dough at the end of the process. As a result, state and federal parliaments are constantly stripping themselves of experienced assets. The insulting proposition is being put forward to the public generally, which has a large number of experienced people in their 50s, 60s and 70s, that a judgment is being made by those being engaged in the political process that somehow, when you reach that age, you are not fit for public life. This is a judgment that no other country has been able to arrive at. That may suggest that they are perhaps right and that we are not. It is unfortunate that Mr Peacock has taken that view and decided to take himself out of the race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to hope that he enjoys his retirement; we know that he will absolutely wallow in it. He has organised for himself a level of private interest outside this place which guarantees him joy until the day he dies. That is terrific for him. Given the contribution that he has made to national life over the last 28 years, we all ought to be able to vicariously enjoy that for him. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like others in this place, I have known Andrew Peacock in the good times and in the bad times. One of the sad things about our democratic process is that, over the last 11 years, those of us who are members of this place have not really been able to see Andrew as a minister. They have seen Andrew in that other role, in which at times I found myself in disagreement with him. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and I look back and wonder, `What if?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, of Andrew Peacock there are several lessons and matters that one can both commend and from which one can draw reference. In the first instance, of his ministerial record, there is little doubt that, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has just suggested, he was very much a man of principle and he made a very considerable contribution within cabinet. I was one of those who served with him in each of the successive portfolios that he held. When the record of cabinet is released&mdash;it will be within the next few years&mdash;many will see that, in the course of cabinet deliberations, Andrew Peacock made a very notable contribution on a far wider range of issues than just those portfolios he held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought the Leader of the House was rather generous in his assessment of the status of the foreign affairs portfolio. I rather thought that was intended more for those whose presence in the political domestic scene might have been an embarrassment for the time being to whomever might have been the incumbent Prime Minister. Consequently, it is normally a portfolio allocated for reasons to attract people outside the country than to allow them to participate in the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly it has often been true that in cabinet debate foreign ministers have been at a disadvantage. Their departments have had little opportunity for briefing on, and understanding of, the domestic policy process. We often tend to criticise them for being ciphers of others, rather than having knowledge of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew was not of that order. While I note the names of those referred to by the Leader of the House as distinguished foreign ministers, I assure him that there are few who have enjoyed, and still enjoy, better personal relations with those who are of consequence in governments around the world than Andrew Peacock. In the foreign policy field, he was certainly able to give an Australian emphasis at a time when we were not quite so assertive, simply because we were younger and not quite as independent as we are today. There were many occasions before he became foreign minister, particularly in relation to policies on South-East Asia&mdash;the Leader of the House mentioned the Vietnam commitment&mdash;when Andrew Peacock's views were considerably in advance of his time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects of Andrew's career that many perhaps did not see. The first is that Andrew was an excellent chairman. Of those with whom I have served, there are few who I believe could chair meetings more effectively. He set about the task of chairing a meeting with the idea not of imposing his view on others but of setting an agenda which would ensure that deliberations could be pursued, discussion would follow and a conclusion would be reached. I am afraid that for many, particularly in the parliamentary scene, reaching a conclusion is the last thing on their mind. Andrew, on the other hand, always pursued the chairmanship of a committee, whether of cabinet or of other parliamentarians, in a way which ensured the meeting deliberated on whatever was before it and concluded before everybody could get bored to sobs with whatever the subject matter might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of Andrew was that he really is great fun. Apart from this devotion, he had a bit of a commitment to the racehorses though I found some of his stories a little hard to believe. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) suggested that he was not always accurate in his tips, yet he is the only man I know who has successively picked the winners of the Melbourne Cup. In that, he was remarkable. I do not know whether it was because of his contacts or for what reason, but he certainly is knowledgeable in that field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of company abroad and at home, I had some wonderful journeys with Andrew. I know that much of it flowed from the fact that he is basically a good bloke. He is always a good conversationalist and he is always prepared to listen  to others. He will argue his own point of view but I found on many occasions whilst travelling that, by listening to Andrew, I did get a different slant on things&mdash;sometimes more liberal than the natural views I might affect, including in Phnom Penh when the Australian embassy had been vacated. We took Neil Davis from Phnom Penh because at that stage it was about to collapse into the hands of the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions abroad, I have found Andrew to have a diverse range of contacts that has stood this country in good stead. When I started my speech, I talked about the problems of this generation not seeing him in government. I think it is unfortunate that men like Andrew Peacock have not been able to contribute in the way that you can in government towards the changing attitude of this country and the relationships we have, for example, in APEC, in the changing relationship we have with ASEAN and with some of the contacts that I think are necessary with the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Andrew's personal life, I have known Susan and Margaret&mdash;his two wives&mdash;particularly well, as Andrew and I were in politics together. I mention them because they were also very important in his life. They were important in assessing the role and contribution of Andrew Peacock as a parliamentarian. It is sad that, for so many of us, Canberra is so far. It is the place away from our homes and it becomes extraordinarily difficult to care for the normal family predicaments and crises. We rely so much on our wives or, for female members of parliament, on our husbands to do so. But I think it is an indictment of this place and of our system that it is very difficult for somebody who is a senior minister and who has a commitment both to politics and to his country that he must give up so much in order to pursue his career successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was one of those who at one stage wondered as a result whether it would not be a good idea for the parliament to provide homes for senior ministers and perhaps opposition members in this place simply so it would be seen as acceptable&mdash;as, for example, it is in New Zealand&mdash;for those who are involved in this process to have a presence here. On the other hand, I think when you look at the other dimension you realise that if you are too committed to Canberra perhaps you do not really know what happens in the rest of Australia, and that is a disadvantage. But there is a price you pay in the family sense and I do not think anybody has paid it to a greater degree than has Andrew Peacock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the general professional level, there were without doubt proper tributes paid during the remarks made regarding Andrew's role in Papua New Guinea. One thing that many perhaps did not see is the personal relationship Andrew has had with successive generations of PNG politicians. While Ceb Barnes, Andrew's predecessor in that portfolio, really set the groundwork for economic independence, there is no doubt that Andrew's personal relationships have been a very significant factor in preserving democracy, though not in the context peculiar to the Westminster system, in the sense that a parliamentary majority has determined successively who that country's Prime Minister will be. When you look at our region, you will see that to an extent democracy is really a fairly jaded flower. In Papua New Guinea, it is strong, it is vibrant and it is effective. It is the parliamentary voice that ultimately counts and the voice of the electorates that determines those who will be members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, Andrew Peacock has had a very dominant influence in that. That personal role he plays&mdash;even so late as last week, when together we were with Sir Julius Chan&mdash;is one which dates to a personal relationship and not one just on an official basis. I think Andrew's greatest personal strengths are his knowledge of Pidgin and his capacity to look at most subjects as others see them. Indeed, he might say in relation to this motion, `Im buggerup finish.' He certainly is Im buggerup finish as far as politics is concerned but, for Andrew Peacock, I am sure the future is rich&mdash;both financially and I trust personally. I wish him well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think that I knew Andrew Peacock probably better than anyone else now sitting on this side of the House. There would have been people before my time who knew him just as well. I would like to direct my remarks more at a personal level but touch on some of the comments made by other speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the assessments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in relation to the contribution made by Andrew Peacock over 28 years. Undoubtedly, no members from this side of the House could associate themselves with the comments made by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in relation to Andrew's professional capacity in serving this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was disappointing that some of the press reflections tended to dwell far too much on a point taken up by the Leader of the House, that is, the last 10 years when Andrew was in opposition, the disputes with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and matters such as that. Andrew Peacock had a long career before all of that, and people forget too quickly that he went very close to a very big upset in 1984&mdash;very close indeed. If you look back at that result, you will see that it was an extraordinarily good effort on his part on behalf of his party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for Swan, I also have some concerns about the somewhat glowing tributes from time to time about Andrew as a foreign minister because there are other contenders for that, including, of course, the present foreign minister, the heir apparent to the seat of Holt. I certainly hope that the heir apparent to the seat of Holt will spend a little more time in the seat of Holt than Andrew spent in Kooyong. That aside, as other speakers have said, I think that Andrew did make a very significant contribution to public life in this country. There is a lot more to a person who held the portfolios that he did, who led his party and who very nearly became Prime Minister of this country than a lot of people have been prepared to accord him since he announced his retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal level, I knew Andrew first at the university in Melbourne, although not well. In those days, the Liberal Party ruled the seas and, if you were acknowledged in the precincts of the university by people of Andrew's standing, you were grateful but you did not approach them. That was the era in which he grew up, the period when we were experts at being in opposition, a role and a mantle which has now fallen on the current opposition&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the problems that we referred to earlier about his disputes and arguments with the member for Bennelong, which are not a matter of concern to us on this side of the House, he nevertheless played a significant role when not leader of the opposition over the last 10 years. He went into overdrive fairly easily, may I say, and was able to adapt to the different pressures that he had in the last few years. He had a bit more time to concentrate on matters he liked so much, such as the races and football&mdash;interests that I shared with him. I think that is how I got to know him so well over the last 10 or 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make about Andrew Peacock is one that I think we all ought to think about in this place from time to time as between ourselves on each side of the House and certainly as between the government and the opposition. I found Andrew Peacock to be a person who did not breach any confidence&mdash;and there were quite a few&mdash;that I shared with him over a period of 10 or 12 years. When I look back to those periods when I was acting foreign minister during the period of the present Governor-General's occupancy of the foreign minister's portfolio and later that of the present foreign minister, there were many occasions when briefings were given to Andrew&mdash;of course, this would have applied to other shadow ministers and other leaders of the opposition, but I did not deal with them as much as I did with him&mdash;and I was always very comfortable in giving any information to him. Later, when I was Attorney-General, on matters involving security the same thing applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But on a personal level that also applied. I often reflect on conversations that I had with Andrew which, if he had been different, I would have very much regretted. But at no stage did I have any concern about that, and I thank him for that. It is a tribute to Andrew that I was able to trust him so much over those years. </PARA>

But, when he took a point of order he took it with a lot of style, he appeared to know what he was talking about and people actually listened to him. I used to sit there somewhat bemused by the fact that he could get away with such outrageous things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in debates he knew absolutely nothing about the procedures that would take place. It used to always be a desperate situation, trying to work out what to do, when I was a minister and Andrew was on the other side. That is when we realise what great assistance we get from the clerks, who perform a tremendous job in this place. I remember many debates in which Andrew was on the other side of the table from me. The task the clerks had to perform in those instances was an enormous one because they had two people who had no idea of the standing orders. I mention to the member for Mayo that I think he ought to reflect very carefully on whether Andrew knew anything about the standing orders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that said, Andrew Peacock was a person who enjoyed himself here. He had a life outside of politics, as people have mentioned. He was good company. He made a good contribution to this country as a minister and as Leader of the Opposition. He is somebody whom I am pleased to see we are remembering today because he was a significant figure in Australian politics and he was a significant foreign minister. Irrespective of what views the Leader of the House and I may have about where he should rank, he was a significant figure in Australian politics and I think many of us at a personal level are going to miss him here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will still see a fair bit of him with the Jason glasses slung casually over his shoulder and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Wizard</EMPHASIS> under his arm, and occasionally at the football; but I will miss him here because he was someone you could always have a bit of a talk to. He was always available to have a yarn about something. He did have a very good sense of humour.

Yes, he will. Somebody said, `He will wallow in it.' That is correct; but he will still be active. He has indicated that he will pursue business interests.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I first met Andrew Peacock in the 1960s when I was a member of the federal council of the Liberal Party and he was the state president in Victoria. He was a very imposing young fellow with all the world behind him and obviously going a long way. To us Queenslanders it was quite impressive to see this young person with such obvious confidence and command. We in the north are not used to those sorts of samplings of power at such a young age. So I was quite naturally attracted to this personality. As a period of time went by, one could not help but enjoy watching Andrew in action in a wide variety of roles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the Liberal Party itself he was always a person to whom you could say, `We are a bit short on numbers at this function. We need to raise a few bob here. Will you please come?' The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), who is at the table, knows what it is like when you get those invitations. You volunteer immediately with great enthusiasm, because it is a hard task to get a lot of people along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew would always do his bit and come along to those functions and, under the most trying circumstances, he would always put in a very good performance. I know only too well that, when you are in opposition for a long period of time, to get people to turn up at functions and raise money you do need someone like Andrew to come along. So I thank him for his role not only as party president but also as an involved member of the party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people here have already spoken of Andrew's enormous contribution to the parliament. When I came here he was a minister. I was lucky enough to serve in the ministry with him in some amazing circumstances. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented upon the fact that foreign ministers do not always know about economics and things like that. There is no doubt that keeping people out of the country was a technique enjoyed by Liberal Prime Ministers, and there are very good reasons for it sometimes. But, to give Andrew his credit, when he did turn up at cabinet meetings at which economic matters were being discussed, he did a very good job&mdash;as the right honourable member for New England did a good job from time to time&mdash;making comments, which were really not that well researched, on matters on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say that a lot of people have not seen his contribution to government. He was a very good performer in the House. He was a person who could certainly command respect and make the appropriate speech, both in the House and at a public function. He could always present well no matter what the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of his ability to communicate with others and other nations, his role in New Guinea and America has already been commented upon. On a personal note, recently I travelled with him and the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) to China. We saw the most extraordinarily polished performance in terms of his ability to communicate with the Chinese foreign ministry and officials. He had a rapport with them. He could remember something about their aunt, uncle or something else. He certainly knew about the Beijing racetrack, which no-one else seemed to know about. He also knew about the one down south which the former Prime Minister was trying to find out about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I travelled with him to America to attend the Republican Party convention last time round. He sailed onto the floor&mdash;and I tagged along with him&mdash;straight past all the guards with a bit of bonhomie, a slap on the back. They were not too sure who he was. I am sure that they had no idea who he was. Before we knew where we were, we were underneath the podium waving to everybody up there and Bush was waving down to those at the bottom. It was just like old home week. He did not just have those sorts of connections with the Republican Party; he had them with the Democrat Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Andrew's ultimate ambition was always to be the Australian ambassador in Washington. If that had been the outcome&mdash;there is no secret about it&mdash;he would have made an absolutely magnificent ambassador for Australia in Washington. No person could have done that job better. No-one was better qualified than Andrew Peacock to do it. If there has ever been a great loss, it is certainly that. His great contribution to Australia may well have been the ambassadorship that he did not get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to say too much, except that history will probably show that if Peacock had won the leadership challenge with Fraser in 1982 the second time around&mdash;he did not have a chance of succeeding the first time: it had to be like the Hawke takeover and the Keating takeover; it had to be on the second roll of the dice&mdash;the outcome of the 1983 election would have been different and the problems of the coalition would have been entirely different. If there is one mistake that Andrew made that flowed on from that, it was his decision in September 1985. That was, in my view, his worst political decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as many have pointed out, he was a guy who was enormously interesting to travel with; he was great fun.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would happily say, although those opposite would not agree, that his time as foreign minister and his grasp of foreign affairs would certainly exceed all others. When in South Africa recently, I was made aware of the reputation and friendships he had built up there. A reception that was put on in Johannesburg was attended by a number of members from the new government. Eddie Funde, who is not a member of the government but a member of the ANC, discovered that I was a Liberal and asked me to pass on his best wishes to Andrew Peacock, Robert Hill and Philip Ruddock.

I have known Andrew Peacock for the best part of 30 years and I have watched his career&mdash;the highs and the lows. When we have talked about his attainments, we have done so in a way that does not display how close Andrew came to being Prime Minister of this nation and what a splendid Prime Minister he would have made. In 1990, Andrew led us into an election where we gained a majority of the Australian vote; more Australians voted for the coalition, led by Andrew Peacock, than for the Labor Party led by Bob Hawke. We obtained over 50 per cent of the vote. It was a cliffhanger for several days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew has been spoken about here as a man who was a splendid chairman, and he was.

He made a fine foreign affairs minister because he had the skill of making people look at where their interests could merge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first became aware of the high regard in which the people of Papua New Guinea held him when I went there in 1980. I went there in 1980 because, like him, I have a passion for the Pacific. I knew that Australia's future as an influential power and as a trading partner lay in our own region. In the late 1970s I made the decision that I wanted to visit the various countries around the rim so that I would have a personal network that I hoped would be useful in the coming years when I hoped to enter this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980 I began by visiting Papua New Guinea because it is our nearest and closest neighbour&mdash;the people with whom we have had an enormously close relationship dating back to the war. It was there that I learned first-hand of the enormously high regard that people such as Michael Somare and Julius Chan had for Andrew. I was there at the time of the first successful vote of no confidence moved by Iamabakey Okuk, the leader of the Nationalist Party, who has since passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion Iamabakey moved was the result of great negotiations that had gone on to stitch up the coalition. Julius Chan emerged as Prime Minister. To see him again as Prime Minister brings back many of those memories. Despite the fact that there was much rancour about whether or not there would be a change of government in 1980, each of them spoke to me and expressed the high regard that they had for Andrew Peacock and expressed their appreciation for the part that he had played in ensuring that self-government for Papua New Guinea meant that democracy was to reign in a new nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew did have a lighter side. On many occasions he and I have been together at international meetings. We both served on the executive of the International Democrat Union. He chaired that union from 1989 until 1992 when he was succeeded by Carl Bildt, the Prime Minister of Sweden. He has the unenviable task of cleaning up socialism after it has been entrenched and held up to the rest of the world as the great way to go. He found the nation bankrupt. During those meetings he showed leadership. In bringing parties together from around the world, all his skills had to be brought into play to ensure that that was a successful and workable forum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to pay a personal tribute to Andrew Peacock. To a very great extent, he is probably the reason I am in this place now. In the early months of 1968 as a young television journalist I was sent on an assignment to New Guinea, armed with a 16-millimetre black and white Bolex camera and nothing much else, where a group of us made a series of documentary features regarding the emergence of Papua New Guinea. I suppose those few weeks I spent there at that time were the beginning of my fascination with that particular place. It was something that I followed through until such time as independence was granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in that latter period that I first met, had some dealings with and interviewed Andrew Peacock on a number of occasions. I suppose to a very great extent it was the nature of Andrew Peacock, the humanity of Andrew Peacock and the politics of Andrew Peacock that ultimately helped to attract me to a parliamentary career. I thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I too was privileged to serve in government with him, although not in the cabinet. There is no doubt that he was one of the finest foreign ministers that this country has ever had. During my experience of serving on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for more than 10 years, I sensed the tremendous influence and numerous contacts that Andrew Peacock has throughout the world. It was really quite fascinating. It really did not matter which country was involved in the inquiries that committee undertook, where you went or who you met, somebody had some kind word to say about Andrew Peacock and had some connection with Andrew Peacock. In that respect, he has been a great ambassador for Australia. I concur with the statements made here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fascinated to hear the speech by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore). I think he was perfectly correct when he said that one of the great tragedies has been that Andrew Peacock was never appointed ambassador to Washington. I sometimes wonder why somebody in government does not really have a look at what is absolutely required in that post in Washington, which is a terribly important one in the Australian context. The reality is that we should have someone with great political experience in that position. We need an ambassador who has the capacity to be able to penetrate the Hill. There is no doubt that politicians have the tremendous capacity to be able to talk to other politicians. With the way that place operates, it is not always possible for some of our career diplomats to have the access that we need to the decision makers on Capitol Hill. I agree that Andrew Peacock would have made an outstanding ambassador to Washington. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He could still do so, as my colleague says. In a personal sense, I also have to thank Andrew Peacock for my second coming in this parliament. I lost my seat in 1983 and made a decision to give the parliamentary scene away, joining the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. That was a very wise decision at the time because they were exciting times. We were opening up Queensland to international tourism and having remarkable success. I had been involved in the opening up of Cairns as an international destination and I was being used by that august corporation to deal with the federal government and to make a number of forays into overseas countries to try to enhance the numbers of international tourists coming to Queensland and obviously to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at that time the Liberal Party was looking for candidates for the 1984 election. Peacock rang me and asked whether I would be interested in standing again and I said no. It was then that the member for Ryan got on the phone, ringing three or four times, and in his inimitable style suggested that I should look at nominating for a seat. On each occasion I declined the offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When coming back on one occasion from southern Africa I arrived in Perth airport at some ungodly hour in the morning&mdash;I think it was about half past three or half past four Western Australian time&mdash;to be greeted by two telephone calls, one from the honourable member for Ryan and one from Andrew Peacock. I think long flights on international aircraft are a marvellous time for members of parliament to start thinking things out. After denying the offer on three occasions, I knew I had done the wrong thing. It was fortuitous that when I landed in Perth these phone calls were there, and I had a conscience which said, `You've got to do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew Peacock was the one who was imposing on that sense of community and that sense of service. Ultimately I decided I would take up that challenge and renominate for a seat. I am not sorry that I did. He gave me some tremendous opportunities in this place by virtue of my time on the front bench, and I thank him for that. He has been a very great friend. He has campaigned for me in every federal election since I first stood in 1974. As others have said, he was always there to assist in the Liberal Party cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one story about him that perhaps I should not tell, but I would like to. Some years ago, Andrew and his wife and my wife and I went away together on a holiday. Erica and I had decided that we were buying an el cheapo package holiday to Thailand&mdash;which I love&mdash;and Andrew said, `We might come too.' Armed with the full one-week package to Bangkok, off we went. What was to follow was quite fascinating. I do not think Andrew did much about it. We arrived at Bangkok airport as package tourists. We were greeted at the bottom of the aircraft stairs by a limousine, a red carpet and a number of people in military uniform. Andrew was whizzed off to the VIP section in this car while my wife and I made our way through the normal terminal and wandered inside. The difference was that, whereas we cleared customs and immigration in a matter of minutes, it took Andrew about 1 1/2 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also fascinating to learn that was the first time he had a holiday overseas since he was 18 years of age. He had made something like 58 official trips on behalf of the government as foreign minister, but had never been on a holiday. He really took to it. Watching Andrew Peacock learning the due processes of bartering and bargaining in some of the clothing markets of Bangkok was something to behold. It was one of the most pleasant weeks that my wife and I ever had. We thank him for that friendship and for the friendship, kindness and hospitality he has shown to us both over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great tragedies is that Andrew Peacock was never Prime Minister of Australia. That sense of humanity that I was talking about, that capacity to be able to listen, to understand what people's aspirations were all about, would have given him the wherewithal to make a great Prime Minister. That is not to be and I think that that is one of the tragedies for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish him well. I am sure that he is going to have an absolute ball. I saw him in this place last Tuesday night when he told me of his intentions to retire and of some of the plans that he had for the future. They are exciting ones. I wish him all the very best.

Although I did not know Andrew Peacock as well as the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy), I probably knew him for longer. Perhaps only the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) would have known him for longer still. They had quite a complicated association back in the days when Andrew first stood for the federal seat of Yarra, then held by Jim Cairns and based on Richmond&mdash;not the Richmond in New South Wales but the Richmond of Carringbush fame, just to the east of Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to confess that I did not spend time with Andrew Peacock on the race track or even at the football. Where I seemed to meet him constantly was at airports and at breakfast, which used to be a great ceremonial in the old Parliament House but has not quite reached that status in the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse what has been said by a number of speakers. He was excellent company, a very honourable person and of extraordinary discretion. If you told him something in confidence, that is exactly where it remained. He did not become Prime Minister, I suspect because he did not have the killer instinct. That is essential for those who rise to the top. They must have an almost Messianic confidence in their own judgment, which I think Andrew lacked. I lack it too, so I am not saying that in a pejorative sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got to know him a long time ago when there were a number of public concerns and matters of public policy on which we shared interests&mdash;and he would perhaps be out of step with some of his colleagues here. We both had a very great interest in civil liberties. We were both very concerned about the abolition of the death penalty. We were both very much concerned about censorship. No matter how we might have to rethink the situation now in the 1990s, there were certain absurdities in the 1960s and the 1970s where Andrew and I shared common ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was also one of those people who played a very important role in taking the demonology out of foreign affairs. We all remember that time in the 1950s and 1960s when a lot of hysteria was generated on foreign affairs. It is to the credit of people like Andrew Peacock and, I have to say, Gough Whitlam&mdash;and Garfield Barwick, in another way&mdash;that they took the demonology out of foreign policy. It is a long time since there was a federal election where foreign policy was raised in a divisive way. That is a sign of our growing maturity. I think Andrew played a very important role in that. His role in Papua New Guinea has been justly praised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew Peacock was a good campaigner. He campaigned effectively in 1984. I suspect though, to some extent, it was because we campaigned dreadfully and for too long. The campaign seemed almost eternal. He finished the election campaign sounding and looking fresher than the then Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a curious election in 1990, when both major parties polled a smaller proportion of the total vote than probably at any time since the 1940s. Where people saw some option of voting for an alternative party&mdash;whether it was the Democrats, the Independents or the Greens&mdash;they took that option. The final result was long, drawn out and it led to a very narrow result in favour of Labor simply because the preferences flowed back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 election was not such a terrific election for either major political party. It was the high point of political convergence; there was such a degree of overlap in policy that it was difficult to distinguish between them. I noticed a silent physical assent from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). That would not have been said of the 1987 election, but was true of 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Andrew has been an excellent parliamentarian. The thing that many of us will remember about him was he had that grace and style.

I am not going to add to its reputation today by pretending that I have been, over the years, as close within my own party to the former member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock, as others who have spoken in this debate. It is one of life's ironies that Andrew addressed the first public meeting I had as the candidate for Bennelong in All Saints church hall in Hunters Hill in April 1974. Some of the remarks he made in that speech provoked a then resident of Woolwich who was there as a member of the public&mdash;Michael Baume&mdash;to join the Liberal Party. He subsequently became a candidate in 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been well documented that Andrew and I had some differences inside the Liberal Party, and I will not try to so rewrite history today to suggest that we did not have differences&mdash;of course we did. Like all differences that occur between people of activity and energy inside political parties, there was blame on both sides. I have indicated that, and so has Andrew. There is no doubt that those differences were, on occasions, regrettable from the Liberal Party's point of view. However, it is also the case, as so often happens with these things, that when a view about differences becomes institutionalised, that becomes the lazy scapegoat every time a political party does not do as well as people might have liked it to have done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very happy to say that over the past few years&mdash;I have used the word before and I will repeat it today&mdash;the relationship between the two of us has certainly mellowed. At a personal level, over the past few years I have enjoyed the opportunity in a way that had not existed before, for a whole combination of reasons, to get to know Andrew better. There is not a lot that I can add to what has already been said today. I think one of the three great political contributions Andrew made was undoubtedly the role that he played in preparing Papua New Guinea for independence. It is one of the gratifying things of politics that the two people who did a lot to bring PNG to independence were Andrew Peacock from the Liberal Party and Gough Whitlam from the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Andrew's role as foreign minister was very distinguished. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and I are the only members in this place who sat in government with Andrew. He certainly was in total command of his brief, especially when he made contributions to cabinet on foreign policy issues. He had a few scraps with Malcolm Fraser. The most celebrated was the argument about the timing rather than the principle of the withdrawal of recognition of the Pol Pot regime in the then Kampuchea. His career as foreign minister was very distinguished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) has indicated, after the 1980 election the Liberal Party entered a period of some turbulence in which the relationship between Malcolm and Andrew was very much at the centre. There is no doubt that Andrew's performance as Leader of the Opposition in the 1984 campaign, when we entered the campaign a long way behind and ended up taking seats from the government, remains a great feather in his cap as a political campaigner. He deserves all of the kind things that have been said about his contribution to that election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect that I observed about Andrew that I have not heard mentioned today is the very close relationship that he enjoys with his three daughters. People have not often described Andrew as a family man. I think in many ways he is a very good family man. He has a very close association with those three girls&mdash;something that I was very conscious of in the discussions I had with him over the last couple of years. They always came to his political meetings. On the last occasion that he addressed his electorate committee in Melbourne last week, he was accompanied by one of his children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join other people in wishing Andrew well. I hope he has a very happy post-parliamentary career. He has been a very significant figure, not only in the Liberal Party. Over the years we may have had our difficulties, but we have shared a number of things in common. One of those things was that we, like so many people on both sides of the House, have devoted  all of our lives to our political cause. He was the President of the Victorian Young Liberals; I was the President of the New South Wales Young Liberals&mdash;a few years apart. He entered parliament some eight years before I did, but he made a very significant contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very happy to say, not just because this is in the nature of a political valedictory, although not a human valedictory&mdash;long may that day be deferred&mdash;that in later years I think we reached a better understanding of each other's aspirations, personalities and contributions. I do not pretend that we were not engaged in very difficult argumentation on occasions. That would be an insult to the memories and intelligence of the people in this parliament. But, as so often happens in life, you grow older, a bit more mature, sophisticated, mellow and intelligent, and you learn from those experiences. I certainly have. To you, Andrew, and your three daughters, I wish you well in your future life. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned by so many who have spoken before, Andrew Peacock worked tirelessly in many ways for me in my electorate. He appeared first on the scene at the Eastwood Masonic Hall in Rowe Street, Eastwood&mdash;it is now in the electorate of Bennelong&mdash;in September 1973 in the lead-up to the by-election in which I first stood. For something like 21 years&mdash;that often goes unnoticed and I am not always unhappy about that&mdash;I have served in the parliament with Andrew Peacock. I do not claim to be his closest friend in the parliament. I do not claim many friends within the parliament. I recognise that in a sense we have professional relationships where we come together because of our shared interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, I do not have many of those very important personal statements to make about occasions shared together except for the distinct surprise that was occasioned to some Lebanese community leaders who were visiting my home one afternoon after Andrew Peacock had paid one of his occasional visits to Rosehill racecourse, which was relatively close to our home at Dundas. On that occasion he actually invited my wife to join him. I think he realised I do not have a particular affinity for either gambling or racing. The surprise of the Lebanese visitors when my wife came home with Andrew Peacock left them telling stories around the Lebanese community in Parramatta for many years to come. Each of those many stories, which we value, add a little lustre to our political life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always took an interest in the human rights aspect of foreign affairs and was particularly interested in events relating to Indonesia, East Timor and Cambodia. Over time we had many discussions about the pragmatic views that a person who was going to pursue Australia's foreign policy interests had to take on some of these questions and how to balance them with the very real concerns for the human beings who are involved in those matters. Certainly, from the discussions I had with Andrew Peacock in relation to those particular issues, I was very conscious of the sense in which the human aspect weighed heavily upon him as well. It was particularly gratifying for me to see his role in relation to Cambodia, after spending time there, again coming to a point where it has an elected government. </PARA>

I had a great and abiding respect for both John Howard and Andrew Peacock, although I did not know either man personally. It was only during the 1990 election campaign when Andrew Peacock came to Ballarat that I spent a short time with him and then started what I hope is a good friendship with him. </PARA>

An unsuspecting trainee cameraman from channel 6, or Vic TV, was taking some panoramic views of the hills behind Ballarat. Andrew Peacock saw the camera going and gave this fellow a payout like I had never heard in my life because he had broken the rules.

At my first party meeting in this place in 1966, Andrew and I sat together in the party room&mdash;and we did so for quite a while, until he became a minister. I only rise now to say that he is a good bloke, a fine fellow and he met all the qualifications that I personally, being a parliamentarian, require. He made me his opposition whip&mdash;I do not want to name the date&mdash;and we had 2 1/2 very happy years together.

I shall not detail stories about him, for he will know the associations he and I shared for a very long period of time. He was always, above all things, an Australian. He thought always of what was best for Australia, he regarded the Liberal Party as part of that deal, but in the final analysis everything he ever did was in the best interests of Australia. It is a queer trick of fate that this eulogy, or whatever we are calling it, is not being broadcast, so Andrew will have to go through the dreadful experience of having to read all the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansards</EMPHASIS> and all the things that have been said this afternoon&mdash;and I say to Andrew, `So you should!'</PARA>

I wish him well in his private life&mdash;but, knowing Andrew, it will not be quite as private as he thinks it will be.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not known Andrew Peacock for 30 years. I first met him very briefly in 1987 during an election campaign when standing for my then unwinnable seat of La Trobe. After that loss, I went back to work running my company and did not associate with politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then in 1990, with Andrew as the leader and my having stood for preselection and being honoured to be preselected, I had the opportunity to work with him in that election campaign. In a very real sense, I owe my being here in no small part to the fact that Andrew Peacock was the leader in that 1990 election campaign. There were nine of us who came into the House of Representatives as a result of that election, as well as two replacement members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having lost that election and having waited a very long time to find out that we were not successful, Andrew convened a meeting of all of us in the old Customs House in Melbourne to try to give us some information about our new roles in our new public life. I recall how well he accepted the loss. His demeanour at the time was pleasant and jovial. He did not display&mdash;at least outwardly&mdash;the sense of devastation he must have felt knowing that, for the second time, he had lost an election to lead the government. He was explaining to us the practical things that we needed to know to be MPs. He got around to the point of the salary. He mentioned the figure and, as I recall, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) piped up and asked, `A week?' Andrew said, `No, Peter; a month.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my early times in this place Andrew went out of his way to help me on two very difficult issues. The first issue was dealing, in a major respect, with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was an issue of very serious concern in my electorate and in areas surrounding La Trobe. His advice was excellent, fastidious and certainly always worth following. He made himself freely available to give that advice. In putting forward a private member's bill for voluntary membership of association, I again sought his advice on the technicalities of the bill and those sections of the constitution which might have been used to empower such a device. </PARA>

I think it was Alan Cadman who said, `Andrew, why did you do that?' Andrew said, `I couldn't be seen to be sitting to the right of Bob Charles.' I wish Andrew well in the rest of his life. He has spent almost half of it in this place in the national capital serving the people of Australia. I wish him well in his future life and future career.

I did not know whether to call him `Your Honour', or `Mr Leader', or `Sir'. But Andrew had that happy knack of making people feel very relaxed about being involved in politics and I developed quite a good friendship with him.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we are back again debating the government's Aboriginal land fund bill. I notice some of the same faces around that we saw a couple of weeks ago. I am currently addressing my comments on this particular bill to the coalition's amendment. It is one of a series of amendments which would turn some pretty ordinary legislation into something that was moderately acceptable but, sadly, the government has so far been unwilling to accept our constructive suggestions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was really quite appalled to hear the minister say during the break that the coalition had been using the debate on this bill to filibuster. I was impressed with the efforts of honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who is at the table, who must have spent some time during the break doing a fair bit of counting and reading. She observed that there had been 85 speakers in the debate in relation to amendments to this bill and of those, 43&mdash;just a majority&mdash;were from the government benches. Therefore, it was the government that was occupying the time. I do not think we should in any way be critical of that fact; indeed, I compliment the government on being able to make the time available to consider these matters in detail. I suspect we will taste the sword of its guillotine before too much longer, but at least there has been some opportunity to discuss these issues and the parliament is so often not granted that chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular clause we are dealing with now refers, amongst other things, to the question of maintaining secrecy where that is considered to be appropriate. The land corporation must ensure that, in dealing with sacred matters, the information is not disclosed and also decide whether disclosure would be inconsistent with the views or sensitivities of Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders. Our amendment draws attention to the fact that that is really a wide-open door to hide almost any kind of unsatisfactory activities, and we are suggesting that when this type of clause is invoked that there should be a report to the minister on the details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, over recent times, a new development in this area with the Hindmarsh bridge decision, where people are basically asked to believe that the bridge is evil; the reason is secret and no-one can be told why. Clearly, if every time the corporation makes a decision about a piece of land it says the reason is secret, then there will be no opportunity for the public to test the legitimacy of that secret reason. I do not think we should allow a new industry to develop based on secret reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If every time the government made an announcement, it could just say, `Well, we are going to do this, and the reason we are doing it is secret' and expect everybody to believe it, naturally, there would be widespread condemnation in the community. That is what the minister is asking the public to accept in this instance. The corporation can make a decision, tell everybody, `The reason we are doing it is secret,' and it is secret because one or two Aborigines regard the reason as a trust to themselves and no-one else can know why. If that sort of logic and reasoning is to follow through, there clearly will be a widespread opening for corruption and a widespread misuse of this particular section, and no-one will ever know whether the secrecy provisions are being used fairly or not. We are suggesting this obligation be placed and there be a report to the minister in those instances so there can be some degree of assessment as to whether the secrecy test is legitimate in that case. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment is at the core of the reason for the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. Honourable members will remember that, when first mention was made of the land fund, it was to be for those people who were not going to benefit from the Native Title Act or by association with the Aboriginal Land Rights Act of the Northern Territory. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has commented on that; he envisaged that only five per cent of the Aboriginal population would benefit from the fund as it is now set up. There was an expectation from the Aboriginal community that those people who were not in line to benefit from this bill in any way or to take advantage of the Native Title Act would benefit from the land fund. It was widely touted that it was for those who could not benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have looked through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), the then the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, is a fairly good example. During the native title debate he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stated purpose of the land fund is to provide a benefit to the majority of Aboriginal people who will not directly benefit from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the core of this amendment. The fund is directed at those who do not benefit from the Native Title Act. I will read out the exact wording of this amendment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(d)the need to give priority in the purchase of land to land on which aboriginal people cannot claim native title under the Native Title Act 1993 or land concerning which aboriginal people cannot make applications under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976;</PARA>

<PARA>I would have preferred to have paragraph (f) as a separate amendment because it is not key to the first two, but because it came in the same area the three paragraphs have been drafted as one amendment, so we will certainly take them together. However, I state at this stage that my main interest in the point I am making is paragraphs (d) and (e). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the land fund bill came out, it was quite a surprise to both the coalition and many of the Aboriginal people I spoke to that there is no mention in it of those people who had suffered dispossession and who could not benefit from the Native Title Act. This was also the assumption of the Prime Minister. On 18 October 1993, a media statement by the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>referring to the Native Title Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will make provision for a land acquisition fund to address the land needs of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose dispossession from their land means they will be unlikely to benefit from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a very clear intention of the Prime Minister. He further elaborated on it on 30 June 1994 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this will be a very small proportion of Aboriginal people because the majority have been forced from their traditional lands.</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to those who would benefit from the Native Title Act. If that is not enough, the Prime Minister confirmed in writing his intention for the land fund bill. On 31 March 1994, he wrote to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is establishing the Fund in recognition of the fact that many indigenous people have been dispossessed of their land and are unlikely to benefit from the native title legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer than that. That is what we have included as our amendment to this bill. Priority should be given to those who have been dispossessed from their land and who do not have a chance to benefit under the Native Title Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond to this proposed amendment comprehensively, and hopefully that will put a number of things on the record which will mean that there will be no further need for me to participate in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I need to make is in respect of the proposed amendment No. 13, paragraph (d), in which the coalition again seeks to fetter, constrain and restrict the board of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Of course, what we do not see is similar constraints and directions being given to the board of any comparable statutory body. For example, it does not happen in the case of some major statutory commercial enterprises, and it does not happen in relation to comparable legislation in this portfolio, because the central purpose of establishing a board of experts and giving them the authority of the parliament to manage a corporation is to repose the trust of the parliament in those experts. Attendant to that in this bill is a very detailed regime of public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not prepared to accept the first part of this amendment because there are some cases where Aboriginal people who may have a capacity to claim native title may have other needs that need to be addressed by the land fund bill that is coming into existence. The first obvious example is that people who have a form of native title may not have title and ownership over a very significant area of perhaps nearby land on which is a site of enormous significance culturally and spiritually to that community. Therefore, of course, there is obvious need for that community&mdash;and perhaps a whole region of people&mdash;to have an allocation of resources from the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conversely, it may be that there are areas which are owned under native title and can be proven before the Native Title Tribunal which are of great cultural significance, but which may be of relatively little economic development potential for that community. Hence the need for flexibility on the part of the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment, of course, is an amendment which can be regarded only as a slight change&mdash;perhaps a very slight change&mdash;to the bill. In fact, the coalition is now on the public record as confirming that all of its amendments are, in the words of the shadow minister, very slight. Given the fact of that acknowledgment, we can look forward to the principal members of the coalition&mdash;and perhaps the coalition as a whole&mdash;supporting this bill, if that is truly the position of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that there was never any chance of the coalition supporting this bill. Every twist and turn on the part of the coalition does nothing to fool Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, who have known very clearly right from the beginning the formal on-the-record commitment of the  honourable  member  for  Barker  (Mr McLachlan), the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who over a considerable period of time have put on the public record their opposition to the establishment of this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the amendment under consideration is also unnecessary. The coalition has said that there is a need to ensure that land which is subject to a claim under the Native Title Act is not acquired. Such an amendment is clearly unnecessary because land that is available for purchase will be either freehold or leasehold and, therefore, on the advice to the government, native title will have been already extinguished, but any existing native title would be protected by the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new paragraph 191N(2)(f) allows the board of the Indigenous Land Corporation the flexibility to determine what emphasis should be given to land management of existing pastoral properties. The suggestion that funding must necessarily be applied to pastoral properties ought to be rejected by the National Party because it would know that there are some properties that might well not be economically viable. It is not the government's view&mdash;and, I am sure, it will not be the view of the Indigenous Land Corporation&mdash;that good money should be put after bad. There is a need to retain the flexibility in the board to get proper management of these properties. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

It surprises me that it would require the coalition to move such an amendment to put into the bill what the government did not have there in the first place.

In fact, coalition members are seeking to do what the government is no longer doing&mdash;we are seeking to make sure that the land fund abides by the Native Title Act. That was the original intention of government members, but they have thrown that out of the window in the hope of scoring political points by opposing our amendments.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>

He knows&mdash;he and I have discussed it before, including across this chamber&mdash;of the bipartisan nature of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in the last three years. It must irk him, as it irks me, that the government is opposing an amendment which so clearly is within the loop of the government's intentions with respect to both the Native Title Act and the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final thing that the coalition is seeking to do is to ensure that moneys spent on the land fund in this particular area go to improving the properties that are currently under the ownership of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. No-one can deny that there have been very serious ramifications of land ownership which has not worked out for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and that there are very strong cases for extra funds to be directed in that area. And what better way to do so than with the land fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that the government would conceive of a position which opposed improving land currently owned by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. One of the reasons the government has given for opposing this is that it would require the government to spend money where the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders might not want to do it; that it would somehow preclude purchasing properties that surround current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander properties&mdash;which, of course, is garbage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's amendment encourages continual purchase around a certain area of land or pastoral properties which could be the subject of Aboriginal ownership. So the stated opposition of government members to the coalition's amendments is absurd, as is their opposition to all the amendments the coalition has been seeking to have included in the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. The reason for that is that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has decided that Aboriginal affairs will be a battleground between the coalition and the government. More is the pity for the Australian electorate and particularly for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander welfare, which we all have discussed many times in this debate already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to reconsider his position. I ask the government to understand that coalition members are genuinely seeking to have a bipartisan position on the land fund similar to the position we had on ATSIC. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will not. Part of the problem has been that, as with smokers in our community, shooters have been put in a position where they are virtually as popular as an STD. The net outcome is as tragic and as horrible as the Hoddle Street and Strathfield massacres. It has led to a situation where many people on the land, because of a lack of knowledge about people who may or may not come to shoot on their properties, have determined that the safest bet is to preclude those people from their properties. The result over the last 10 or 15 years has been a dramatic explosion in the population of feral cats and, in particular, feral foxes&mdash;not that foxes are anything other than feral, but I think we should continue to call them that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some contact with the Snowy Mountains Environmental Alliance. The spokesman for that alliance, Mr Peter Muller, from Thredbo, has convinced me that it would be in the interests of this government and in the interests of environmental protection for us to impose a bounty on feral cats and feral foxes. We would need a substantial bounty, something between $10 and $20. If we do not do this, I believe that all other actions in terms of the environment, protection of wildlife areas and wilderness and the elimination of some industries will be in vain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted recently in a shooting magazine that a number of shooters went to an area in the Northern Territory which was so far away from townships that they felt they would not find any feral animals. They ended up bagging something like 200 feral cats in an area which would not be seen as a place which could possibly support that population. The reason why it supported that population is that man has introduced ready water supplies. Whereas these animals would not previously have been able to inhabit such arid areas, with access to ready water supplies such as bores they are able to inhabit these areas. If people in the Snowy Mountains Environmental Alliance can see that the Kosciusko National Park is in danger, and if feral cats and feral foxes are able to exist in the far-flung, dry parts of our continent, I believe we have a problem which is far greater than any of us can imagine. </PARA>

We do not know the health risks that these towers pose, but we do know the aesthetic outrage that so many of them actually engender. The problem is that the telecommunications rules permitted by this government do not adequately provide for better consultation and better communication between telecommunications companies and residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a number of instances of this in my own electorate. In Harbord, Optus attempted to put up a 30-metre mobile phone base station in the grounds of a hospital and next door to a child-care facility. Luckily this has been defeated thanks to the efforts of local residents Glenda Dorro and Ann Birchfield and also thanks to the good sense of Optus, which withdrew once it realised just how deep local opposition to this installation was. Unfortunately, there is another situation in the electorate of Warringah and this time the company Vodaphone has not shown the same good sense that Optus showed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vodaphone wants to install a mobile phone base station in the Tarquin block of flats in Fairlight. The body corporate council&mdash;that is to say not the body corporate but the council of the body corporate&mdash;agreed at what I believe was a very sparsely attended meeting to accept this installation, to give Vodaphone a lease. Vodaphone must have known that under the Strata Titles Act a lease of this sort requires not just a majority decision but the unanimous consent of all the members of the body corporate. Notwithstanding the fact that it did not have that, Vodaphone went ahead and began to carry out construction work in the Tarquin building. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became clear once this was done that there was in fact massive opposition amongst the residents of Tarquin to what was being done. But instead of saying, `Let's stop. Let's consider. Let's consult,' the company's attitude has been `Let's push ahead. Let's bulldoze opposition. Let us steamroller our way into constructing this facility'. Vodaphone is now arguing that because the installation is, to some measure, already there, it has a licence to operate its installation even though the Strata Titles Act makes no provision whatsoever for a licence to be given by the body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that Vodaphone, as a responsible corporate citizen, must draw back. It must stop trying to intimidate the body corporate and residents via lawyers' letters. It must accept that there is significant opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the rules do not provide for sufficient consultation; they do not provide sufficiently for the rights of residents. In the Senate the coalition will shortly be moving to block the telecommunications code. We believe that there should be more emphasis on co-location. We believe that there should be a much longer consultation period between these companies and residents. We believe that the government should at least consider the possibility of a residents' veto for people living within the shadow of these towers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CF4">Mr CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am well aware of who set it up and I will come to that. That royal commission cost the Australian public $40 million. What were the findings of the royal commission? The commission's written findings were: firstly, there was no evidence of any corrupt behaviour by the government in Western Australia; and, secondly, no evidence of illegality by any government member. It did say there were issues of what it described as `inappropriate behaviour'&mdash;not illegal, but inappropriate behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Parker is not suffering from the royal commission but from the attack that went on afterwards. After spending all that amount of money there had to be scalps. I have spoken before about Brian Burke and I can say this about him: I was not a supporter of Burke because of his style. I never believed he was corrupt; I do not believe so now. I believe that he was not convicted on the evidence&mdash;the waffle by the judge who sent him to gaol was absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parker was convicted by a jury that was fed absolute venom by the media&mdash;McCarthyism at its height. For years the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> sat on its hands and all of a sudden it felt it had to atone. The stupidity of this jury decision was that the only two witnesses were dead. How could that jury have a better idea of their instructions to Parker than Parker himself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lang Hancock was a great man who, I believe, has not been honoured enough in this country. He was a man who saw his own character and enterprise attacked savagely by Sir Charles Court. I knew Lang Hancock well and I was an unabashed admirer of him. Lang Hancock was the first man to ever give me a donation, and I was very young at the time. I said to Lang Hancock, `I couldn't possibly take a donation from you unless I was absolutely sure there were no strings attached.' Lang Hancock looked at me distastefully and said, `What could you possibly do for me?' He went to his drawer, pulled out $2,000 and flicked the money across to me saying, `It's all in old bank notes. Do you want to count it?' I said, `No. I am very happy to accept it.' That was 1979 and that was the first donation I had. It was in a campaign where I was not expected to win and there was absolutely no suggestion of any sort of ties with that money at all, and the same would have applied to Mr Parker. That was the scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these people were convicted because of this absolute torrid McCarthyism where evidence did not matter any more. People went into that jury saturated with venom from the only daily newspaper in Australia that had run this vendetta. I will say this before my time runs out: I have a file this thick on the performance of a very senior member of the Liberal Party which goes to corruption affecting the national interest&mdash;not over recent times but over 15 years. This will come out in due course. It is hard to get it out now because when this was taken to the police force they said, `Phooey, all your witnesses are dead.' That is the sort of justice we are getting in Western Australia. The honourable member opposite looking at me with his Christian outrage is one of the people I believe has a lot to answer for. I believe that, eventually, this will come out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is they tried to destroy the documentation of the Western Australian royal commission. We say that justice will come in the end. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make those names clear: Parker, Burke, Edwards, Brush, Pearce&mdash;the list goes on for longer than the adjournment debate would allow. These names are just the visible tip of the problem. What about the people who knew about the stealing, about the graft and corruption, and yet remained silent? Surely they are just as culpable, yet they run for cover like frightened puppies when the truth comes out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, David Parker, the former Deputy Premier of an Australian state, now stands convicted of seven charges of stealing&mdash;serious charges indeed. His former friend and Western Australian Premier Brian Burke is also at this moment in gaol after being convicted on similar and no less serious charges. Notwithstanding what the member for Kalgoorlie had to say about the Western Australian royal commission, the royal commission in its final report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are satisfied that Mr Burke deliberately diverted the funds ($100,000) from this particular donation (Yosse Goldberg's $300,000) with the intention of using those funds for his own purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The commission described his conduct as reprehensible. Later this year Mr Burke faces more charges of improperly using Labor Party funds for his own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the legacy of corruption. It is corruption so foul that almost every man, woman and child in the Labor Party has disowned both men. I note that the member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) is here this evening. Even she said that she hardly worked with Mr Burke after he had finally received his sentence. It will be interesting to see how well she admits to knowing Mr Parker in light of today's developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fremantle is not the only Labor figure who moved through the stench of WA Inc. but said they refused to inhale. As I have said, the blame for this fiasco caused by the Labor Party in the mid-1980s rests with a lot more people than just the gaolbirds. The real tragedy here is the way the entire party allowed its own to steal, corrupt and lie with nothing so much as a word of caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Kalgoorlie will recall the 1989 state election and how at the very time that election was being conducted the Premier of Western Australia was involved in a project dubbed the PICL project. He was in negotiations with Mr Bond concerning a project that eventually wasted $450 million of Western Australian taxpayers' money for nothing except blue sky. Even now after the convictions, after the revelations of the royal commission, we have Labor luminaries and lesser luminaries prepared to try to justify the conduct of these Labor Party parasites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In defence of Mr Parker at the recent trial in Perth the President of the Senate, the then state secretary, admitted that the Labor Party used campaign funds for all sorts of interesting expenses. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 19 September he was quoted as defending the practice of paying one Labor candidate's gambling debts with donated money to prevent any bad publicity. `The party's image and reputation were at stake,' he said. `The only thing that mattered was winning the election,' he said. That just about sums up the Western Australian Labor Party's attitude to accountability and to proper conduct of government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Labor Party's attitude is win at all costs, ignoring all the foibles of your own mates&mdash;damn accountability, forget honesty, turn a blind eye to the filthy lucre of bribery and extortion. What a laudable platform on which to build a political party! All I can say is that if the member for Kalgoorlie seeks to defend that sort of behaviour in this chamber by trying to throw it back at us then God knows what he is up to. </PARA>

The WA Inc. royal commission documentation is absolutely clear and it is as I stated, not as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) stated. Even so, he pulls back from saying that the royal commission said there was any illegality. There was none.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the PICL project, for example. The cost of the PICL project to the state was $5 million. That is well within the valuations that were given to the government by the experts of the day. I know a little about the PICL project. I believe it was a very useful project and it would have been very beneficial to the people of Western Australia. I approached ICI, a very large chemical company, during the height of the battle. I said, `I know you people have been looking at  this. I want you to come clean with me.' They said, `Yes, we have been looking at it. In our view the return on capital is not good enough. We are looking for something like 30 per cent. We believe the return on capital will be something like 17 per cent.' But, they said, for a government which has other priorities, such as employment, and has to use the gas, which it was forced to do because Charles Court signed a take or pay contract, the contract that nearly sent Western Australia broke&mdash;because of those parameters, we think it is a good project and we would like a window into it.' I asked, `What's a window?' They said, `Five or 10 per cent; no more than 10 per cent.' I asked, `Would you buy 10 per cent at the present valuation?' They said, `Yes we would.' I said `I suppose you would want to manage it then.' They said, `No. It is our view that Alan Bond has assembled the best management team in the world. We could do no better. We would like someone on the board but we don't want to interfere in the management.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the impression given. I tried to communicate that to Dowding, but Dowding's office was in a siege mode and had already decided that it was going to wrap it up? Why? Because it was operating on the advice of those great economic geniuses Wran and Turnbull who said, `If you pull the plug, Bond will be broke in a couple of months and he won't bother you.' They were about two years out in their timing. That was the situation with the PICL project. It was a very good project that was destroyed by lack of intestinal fortitude on Dowding's part and by the continual sniping of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission findings were that there was no evidence of corruption or illegality. But we see people like the honourable member opposite, the honourable member for Moore&mdash;and it is done repeatedly in Western Australia&mdash;taking the money that was lost and saying that it was lost in Rothwells, buttressing Rothwells. Then they say that it was lost in PICL and they add the two together. The truth was that no money was lost in Rothwells because it was rolled into PICL. The money can be lost only once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, not surprisingly, those opposite know nothing about business and they are obviously hell-bent on double counting. The reality is this: the economy in Western Australia was probably second only to Queensland. The truth is that Bjelke-Petersen left the economy of Queensland in an excellent state. Western Australia was the next best. Western Australia had never been in a recession. We did not have an official recession because of the good groundwork laid by the Burke government. Had the Burke government not decided on that long weekend to bail out Rothwells there would have been a catastrophe. There would probably have been 10,000 jobs lost and wholesale panic in the stock market. The government took the only reasonable action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crichton-Browne, the only one on the Liberal side from Western Australia who has any understanding of business at all, said to me, and he has kept his word, `You will never hear a word out of me about so-called WA Inc. because in my view the government will be the last to know. If it happened tomorrow the government would do it all over again.' We saw that happen, on a smaller scale albeit, when the Liberal government moved to bail out the Albany cannery. It just so happened that the directors were also creditors and all members of the Liberal Party. I do not blame them for doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw what happened in Victoria when the government there said after Pyramid,`Oh, hands off. It's nothing to do with us.' There was a great crescendo in the media and the government lasted 48 hours. What the government did in Western Australia was the correct thing to do at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the teachers union. We bailed out the teachers credit union. We guaranteed that people did not lose their money. It was a sensible thing for responsible government. Why did this happen? For 20 years you had a controller of credit unions appointed by the Liberal Party who did nothing. The Labor Party appointed a controller of credit unions and said, `This whole thing stinks. It is wrong' and pulled the plug on it. The Labor government therefore bailed out 20 years of incompetence and dishonesty by the Court government. Those are the facts of the matter. This will eventually come out because we were able, in the face of strong moves by people such as you, to destroy the records of the royal commission. The truth will come out. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)&amp;(3) In the context of the 1994/95 Budget the Government announced that it would provide a further $4.9m for construction and $0.45m for operation to the NTA in 1995/96 to extend terrestrial transmission of SBS television to two more regions, Richmond/Tweed in NSW and Wide Bay in QLD. A further $0.9m will be provided annually for continuing operating costs. These centres were chosen by the Government because they provided the largest audience coverage which could be achieved by the provision of new transmission facilities, thus enabling a more cost effective use of resources relative to other regions. The extension of SBS television will provide access to the service for a further 286,000 people in the Richmond/Tweed region and 268,000 people in the Wide Bay region (total 554,000). By comparison, it is estimated that the extension of SBS television to the Upper Murray region (including Albury/ Wodonga) would provide coverage to between 135,000 and 150,000 people.</PARA>

This section does not apply to the disclosure of information to the Minister, Secretary to the Department, or to an officer of the Department designated by the Secretary. Austrade is also bound by the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (1982) which do not allow the disclosure of the business affairs or personal information of any other person without the express permission of the person on whom the information is sought.

The decision to purchase new locomotives, and the selection of a tenderer to supply these locomotives, are matters for National Rail, not its shareholders. The funding of any such purchase is also a matter for the Corporation and not for any one of its shareholders, who collectively agreed, when establishing the company, not to guarantee any borrowings by it.</PARA>

The Library is able to conduct searches of Australian and overseas databases; requests for such services (at a fee) are able to be received from members of the public either to Worksafe or through their local library. The Library is also connected to Internet (via AARNet, the global email network) and therefore is able to obtain OHS information from international academic institutions.</PARA>
