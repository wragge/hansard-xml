So sleepy was the ABC and so little was the response from anyone ringing in to its switchboard at that hour of the night, that no-one noticed. My wife noticed because she was feeding Harrison at the time and she regularly watches the rebroadcast.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my great pleasure to rise today to speak on the budget and the measures associated with the budget. In so doing, I emphasise some issues which arise from the general direction which the government has taken in the budget and the white paper&mdash;especially the philosophical direction it has taken&mdash;and to contrast that with the direction the opposition parties, especially the Liberal Party in its revived form, have been attempting to take.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Obviously, the central thrust that comes out of the budget is the emphasis on social justice. There is no doubt that social justice is the key factor behind the white paper and the attempts through the white paper to do something for the long-term unemployed. In that context, there is also no doubt that the initiatives of the white paper, in trying to come to grips with the problems of the long-term unemployed, are some of the most revolutionary of those adopted in any Western country. As the green paper stated, rather than allow the marketplace to simply take a very long time in getting the long-term unemployed to find employment, even in the context of an economic recovery, the white paper has put in place a comprehensive program that attacks the problem by trying to ensure that every long-term unemployed person is looked after, especially on a case by case basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a very significant attempt to ensure that these people are put into employment. Where there are difficulties in terms of the level of training, there will be a very significant attempt to put them into training, into labour market programs and, in certain cases, into education programs. For example, there will be an attempt to put people of migrant backgrounds who have insufficient English resources into English language programs. In other words, we will do everything to ensure that the long-term unemployed are given a sustained position in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concept of social justice for the long-term unemployed and giving everyone a guarantee to help them contrasts dramatically with the concept of social justice which the conservative parties have had. One might have thought that with the change of leadership in the Liberal Party we might have been able to look forward to some change in the areas of the attitude to the unemployed, the attitude to aged care, the attitude to health and the attitude to those who are the most disadvantaged in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, with the new face of the Liberal Party, notwithstanding the claims of the new leader that there would be a move to a more middle ground approach and to a party that was not ideologically driven, in the new shadow cabinet only two people come from the moderate wing of the party; the rest come from the dry ideological hard right. This is not something that I have stated; it was on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> when the new shadow cabinet was announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People wondered how this very dry shadow cabinet was going to suddenly transform itself into having a new philosophy and a new position from which it was going to put forward a middle ground, pragmatic and reasonable approach compared to the previous approach, given that the frontbench, especially the key shadow cabinet frontbench, was constituted by the hard dries of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the extraordinary situation that the moderate spokesman on certain key areas of responsibility with respect to social justice was shifted into the outer cabinet. In the key health area we have had the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) put forward as the health spokesman, which includes dealing with the key area of social justice. I suppose this is part of the new image of the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the honourable member for Mackellar presented her maiden speech. In the maiden speech she attempted to present the philosophy which she was going to pursue within this parliament. If one analyses that philosophy, the fundamental point that comes through is that it is unreconstructed New Right philosophy. In fact, it is more extreme than the most coherent spokesman of the New Right in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the honourable member for Mackellar, the situation in respect of the pursuit of the philosophy of the modern Liberal Party is to be nothing more than a return to a 19th century view of the political philosophy of the right; that is, total emphasis on individualism and total rejection of any participation by the state. That was the gist of her philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her speech the honourable member tried to tell this House that the models to be pursued were Britain and New Zealand, two nations&mdash;not the only two, but the two she chose&mdash;which have pursued the Thatcher New Right philosophy. Newspapers reported last week that the British Prime Minister, Mr Major, made a shameful attack on homeless unemployed people, telling them that they should not be begging in the streets. The fact that people now have to beg in the streets of Britain&mdash;something that never happened for many years&mdash;is a testament to the failed policies of Thatcherism and the New Right. That is a fundamental point which the whole of the world has understood except, of course, the new federal opposition. It dares to pretend that it believes in social justice and then puts forward people who hold extreme right views as its major spokesmen in health and other key areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to pursue the views put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar we would hold to the very simple minded idea that it is just a question of choosing between the individual and the state, between what the individual and the marketplace can deliver to the individual and what the state can do. This simple minded philosophy has been rejected even by the thinkers in the right. Everyone understands that in the modern world you cannot simply have the marketplace taking the dominant role, the total role, with respect to the individual and have the state taking a negligible role. That kind of approach was rejected even by the founder of the Liberal Party, the Hon. Robert Menzies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of going to the position set out by Menzies, which was a relatively modern position for the time, if we are to find anyone who propounds the sorts of views set out in the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar we have to go backwards into history, into the 19th century. This would not be a matter of concern if these were simply the views of one individual but with the new Liberal Party we now have a number of spokespersons who are supposed to deal with key social justice areas and social policy areas and whose credentials in terms of their personal philosophy are such that they are not moderate people. They are not people who are talking about the necessity of balancing the role of the state and the role of the marketplace to deliver the best situation for the rights of the individual. They are people who would totally get rid of any role for the state and the government and leave the individual to the ravages of the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen in Britain and in other countries that have adopted this formula, such as the United States under President Reagan, an underclass has been created, a group of people who are permanently either unemployed or in severe poverty and who receive no reasonable assistance. That would be the consequence of adopting a philosophy such as that put forward by the honourable member for Mackellar. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member interjects that we have an underclass here now. This is how much he knows about sociology. The reality is that Australia, through proposals put forward in the white paper and other measures adopted by this government, has been able to avoid that phenomenon. In fact, we are the only Anglo-Saxon country that has avoided that phenomenon because we have never adopted the absurd New Right philosophies of Thatcherism and Reaganism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to continue to have some measure of debate on social justice policy in this country, as was hoped when the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) took control, those members of the opposition frontbench who hold these extremist views ought to be shifted or they ought to be told to adopt a new philosophy and approach. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Bishop in iron maiden speech' outlines the approach of the honourable member for Mackellar. Obviously, she is going to model herself on Margaret Thatcher. She should note that Margaret Thatcher's approach has been rejected even by the bulk of the Conservative Party in Britain. The problem is that the Conservative Party cannot find a new philosophy to replace it and is struggling to find some identity. But the reality is that the approach of Mrs Thatcher has been rejected even by the party which she led. It certainly has been rejected by most of the conservative parties around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the new Leader of the Opposition was elected, we hoped that we would see on the opposition front bench at least a balance between the moderates and the dries. We hoped that we would see the development of a new approach and a new philosophy which would allow for a genuine debate in this country about social policy issues in the areas of health, aged care, assistance to the disabled, assistance to the unemployed and ethnic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred in the area of ethnic affairs is an outrage. The President of the Federation of Ethnic Communities Council of Australia was forced to issue a statement, following the announcement of the membership of the new opposition frontbench. Notwithstanding the Leader of the Opposition's assertion of his support for multiculturalism, the spokesperson for immigration and ethnic affairs has been shifted out of the shadow cabinet. He is now in the outer shadow ministry. Can you believe that? In the key area of multiculturalism and ethnic affairs, the opposition spokesperson, Senator Short, has been shifted out of the shadow cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can anyone take seriously the claim that the opposition is really interested in presenting any new philosophy or position when its key spokespersons are ideologically of the New Right? The honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who is now responsible for community services and aged care, has been shifted to the outer ministry. So those people who may have brought some new ideas and balance and provided greater comprehension of social policy have been shifted out of the shadow cabinet. We now have an extremely dry opposition frontbench which is once again putting forward the same old philosophy, if the speech by the honourable member for Mackellar is any guide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to this, the government is moving forward with respect to the continuing development of its social philosophy. We are now increasingly defining social justice as not merely a set of programs but a coherent philosophy of social rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than looking simply at what the individual might gain from society through the marketplace, this government is committed to a situation in which the most disadvantaged, the most unfortunate, are assisted through government programs and guaranteed that assistance as of right. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Slipper" NAMEID="0V5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QJ4">Dr THEOPHANOUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will conclude on the point of jobs. One of the most important rights that one can guarantee is, increasingly, the right to employment. We have had the recession and we are now coming out of it. The government has said that it is not going to allow a situation in which the long-term unemployed, those who find it difficult to participate in the work force because they have been the most tragic victims of the recession, stay unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather the government is going to have active programs to assist these people to become job ready&mdash;to get training, to gain the relevant level of education&mdash;and to get jobs. If the honourable member had bothered to look at the white paper he would know that jobs will be created through special wage subsidy incentives for employers who take on the long-term unemployed. There will be not only the creation of a large number of jobs through the wage subsidy scheme but also a special scheme specifically for the long-term unemployed, the people who have been most disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is social justice in practice. This is an attempt to put forward a social right for the unemployed and to ensure that they are guaranteed improved prospects. There could be no further illustration of the philosophical difference between the government and the opposition than the guarantees which have been given by the government to the unemployed and the general attempt to embed in this society the general social democratic philosophy that people are entitled to a fair go and that the state, the government, has a very important role to ensure that they do get a fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially, I congratulate the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) and the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) on their maiden speeches. I know the honourable members for Mackellar and Warringah will have very great contributions to make in this place and I hope they enjoy their time here. I certainly extend to the honourable member for Bonython the sentiment that he has a very fulfilling time in this chamber though hopefully not an enduring one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to commence my discussion of the budget by reminding honourable members of some of the headlines that graced the front pages of Australia's newspapers on 11 May, the day after the budget was delivered. The screaming headlines included, `Betting on a boom', `Rubbery risk', `Vote for me and my budget', `A trust-me budget', `Labor punts on growth and a trusting public'. A <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> headline appropriately read `What budget? Mr Willis fudges the figures'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people agree that this year the government has delivered an unnecessarily risky budget. The government is betting on a continuing economic recovery and massive business investment to solve the nation's problems&mdash;which, of course, emanate from 11 years of Labor rule. The government is playing a gambling game. Gamblers rarely come out on top and if they do, it is only temporary. The gap in this nation between the rich and the poor has widened during the 11 years of Labor. In fact, a lot of what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), said was utter nonsense. This is a government of the rich and not of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia no longer has a reputation as an equal, classless society. Today only 40 per cent of Australian households could be classed as middle income earners, while in the 1970s 65 per cent of households received an income of between $22,000 and $72,000 a year. This is a tragedy and sadly we have seen the development of an underclass in this country, and this trend is continuing to grow. We now see gaps opening up that did not exist before. In 16 years, the middle class of Australia has collapsed. Those affected make up, of course, Menzies' forgotten people. Fifteen per cent of Australian households had an annual income below $22,000 in 1976 but in 1992 that figure had increased to 38 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the Australia our founding fathers envisaged. Who would have thought that in 1994, the International Year of the Family, an Australian couple would be better off financially and better able to provide for their children if they were divorced in this the year of the family? The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> published a story the day after the budget about a family which was desperately looking for some relief in the budget. It was a story about a Melbourne middle-class couple with three children. Their son had had to move out of home to receive higher Austudy payments and rent assistance, and a daughter was planning to do the same. The parents, both unemployed, said that if they divorced or lived separately they would be better off financially under the existing social security system. The family received $525 in unemployment benefits per fortnight, and after paying $200 a week rent they were left with about only $60 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many families throughout Australia in the same situation. They are living in hope that their elected representatives will help. Consequently, when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brought down his budget this year, they were looking for a life raft. They were looking for some assistance; instead, what they got was more of the same. Quite frankly, it is time that this government either fixed the problem or stepped aside to allow others to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have around a million people out of work and possibly up to two million Australians unable to find sufficient work. We have hundreds of thousands of Australians involved in the no-win training schemes of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which serve only one purpose&mdash;to rort and fudge the jobless figures, to make it seem as though fewer Australians are out of work than in fact really are. These training schemes will fail and will continue to fail because there are no jobs to go to. People have come to me in my office and complained that they have been sent to four, five, six or seven training schemes; they have this ticket and that ticket but still no job. We have the best trained dole queues in the world, and that is a tragedy for unemployed Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the government's white paper on unemployment, the so-called Working Nation package, which has basically disappeared without trace, and the government's white paper on employment. That does not create jobs; it just trains more people. We need $6.5 billion to pay for these programs. Where does the government expect to get the money? With its betting record, one would imagine it will go off to the casinos of this nation. In reality the government probably hopes to take it from business&mdash;big business and small business&mdash;by increasing taxes, by extending the fringe benefits tax, by seeking to enforce greater compliance with the tax system. I notice that it expects to raise $300 million from increased compliance measures. The government is bleeding business dry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this budget increases taxes on all Australians, and the government is increasing its outlays as well. What happened to the recommendations of the FitzGerald report? If the government refuses to save, why should the Australian people save? This government should be setting an example. Instead it spends more, takes more, sells the family silver and relies on gambling to pay its debts. What sort of example is that for the Australian people? What sort of example is that for young Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an extravagant government, a government of want and waste. Australians have witnessed want and waste at the Lodge, fraud and waste in the Department of Social Security and in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. We have seen hundreds of millions of dollars squandered on bureaucratic consultancy fees. This government takes more from the people; it spends more, wants more, wastes more and ultimately owes more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this budget, the government will squander any benefits of economic recovery in a bid to shore up its short-term political prospects, its increasingly bleak political prospects. It has tried to make the country's economic position look better than it really is by exaggerating growth and business investment forecasts. This is an election budget. To quote from the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> on 11 May:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Short of actually producing How To Vote cards on the floor of the House of Representatives, it is difficult to see what more the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and his Treasurer, Mr Willis, could have done in the production of an election Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having proclaimed within the first minute or so of delivery "no new taxes and no increases in tax rates" (not entirely accurately), Mr Willis promptly found some megadollars to address recent headline concerns.</PARA>
<PARA>The megadollars will come partly from the sale of family silver. The government's rubbery figures are partly based on unattainable sale prices for Commonwealth assets. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said yesterday, the government is `selling off the family silver to pay the champagne bills'. He said, `You can sell the silver only once, but the champagne bills keep coming.' Unfortunately, the government appears to be drunk. The government does not really understand what is happening. It is time that the government started to think past the next election and to introduce policies that address the very real problems of this nation and its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can return to its former status, it can provide its citizens with one of the best standards of living of all OECD countries, but it cannot do that if we continually flog off our assets and use the proceeds for recurrent expenditure rather than to reduce debt. This government has a moral responsibility to the Australian people to discontinue its slick, fast money tactics and bandaid solutions in its never ending shopping spree in pursuit of votes. This budget's projected $11.7 billion deficit was designed to soothe the financial markets which were displeased with the Working Nation package. But take away overambitious sales prices based on assets, repayments and other figure fudging exercises, and in reality we are more likely to have a budget deficit in the 1994-95 year of a figure approaching $18 billion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Sound economists have pointed out that this government's deficit figure of $11.7 billion is nothing short of a fraud. At a time of economic recovery, the government should be saving, attempting to reduce our debt and planning for the future. The Australian business community has had to cut back over the past decade in order to survive and yet has maintained its level of service to the community; the government can and should be doing the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, the government is moving very much in the wrong direction. The government has had very little favourable comment on its budget. The budget editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> said it all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That trend defies conventional economic theory that governments should spend more in recessions to stimulate activity but cut back when the economy improves. . . The budget is based on expectations of 4.5 per cent real growth next year&mdash;at the upper limit of predictions by private economists and well ahead of growth among OECD nations. It also hinges on a mooted rush of business investment.</PARA>
<PARA>The 4.5 per cent growth figure is based on the assumption that private investment will increase by 14.5 per cent. As we all know, there was nothing in the budget to trigger new business investment&mdash;another gamble. The government is relying on business to start spending because there appears to be a favourable economic climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What if demand continues to rise and business does not spend? Then we are again faced with the danger of inflationary pressures. We might see an increase in investment in the future but not at the level the government forecasts. Many commentators from the business community have said that the government's growth forecasts are unduly overoptimistic. Most recently, Don Mercer from, I think, the ANZ Bank said that the government's figures were not figures that he would expect to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Reserve Bank has now confirmed that interest rates are rising. Our industrial relations situation, particularly following the passage of the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Act, is unlikely to encourage investment or promote jobs. In fact, the Industrial Relations Act will cost jobs, and that is why the government is having to come into the parliament to seek amendments: it knows that the Industrial Relations Act is an unmitigated disaster. An Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry spokesman, Ian Spicer, confirmed, after the budget was announced, that investment would not occur to an adequate extent and jobs would not be created. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . business will be concerned about the credibility of the economic projections, especially as they relate to plant and equipment, based on extremely optimistic growth of over 24 percent. There are also questions about the underlying deficit which is well above $11.7 billion. Depending upon the degree, this will affect interest rates and work against investment.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no surprise that the figures are phoney. The government's record at fudging figures is impeccable&mdash;just look at unemployment: change the names of a few welfare payments, shuffle a few large groups of unemployed people into different Department of Social Security lines, call them trainees and, like magic, the unemployment rate drops overnight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constituents in the Fisher electorate have not been fooled by the government's budget. Many have contacted me since 10 May to say that this budget offers them nothing. People are appalled that the government has effectively abandoned its second round of tax cuts. People are appalled at the $1.24 billion Aboriginal land fund which treats some Australians differently from others. Sunshine Coast residents are angry about the impact the departure tax hike will have on the region's international tourist industry. This government has no real understanding of the contribution the tourist industry makes to the economy and just how important tourism is for job growth not only on the Sunshine Coast but throughout Queensland and Australia. As well as the revamped departure tax, $17 billion in tax will be taken from the tourism industry this year. These tax increases will deliver a major blow to our international competitiveness as a tourist destination and will impact heavily on international tourist havens like the Sunshine Coast. Job seekers will be the losers on the Sunshine Coast as a result of these tax increases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Few budgets have been as well received as the budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 10 May. It was well received because it was a realistic budget which set the course for national growth in the economy. It has really been interesting to listen to opposition members struggling to find areas to criticise. I noticed one theme coming out: they are starting to say that our children or our children's children will be the ones who pay for this budget. It will be a very different society that our children or our children's children reside in. Those people in future generations will look back on this budget as a landmark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very interested to hear some of the opposition's very imaginative imagery. I sometimes wonder about the opposition. I know an opposition party is there to oppose and put an alternative point of view, and I would not argue with that. Why is the opposition not more supportive of this country when putting that alternative point of view? Why is it always talking the economy down in this country? Why is it always sending negative images of Australia and our economy abroad? I believe that an opposition has a role to play and has a duty to stop sending such false and negative images. </PARA>

Why did the major groupings from all sides of the economy, from all sides of the nation, support this budget? I listened, as I always do, to the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) when he told us how his phone had been ringing hot since the budget had come down. Every time a budget is handed down I have my staff in my electorate office on stand-by. We have a spreadsheet showing the various issues that people will ring up and comment on either for or against. At the end of the day my staff phone the results through to me so I can report them to my colleagues here. At 5 o'clock on the day after the budget, the spreadsheet was still virgin white. There was not a mark on it, because not one person in the electorate of Throsby rang up. I might say that they did not ring to congratulate me either, but they did not ring on one issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put all this nonsense aside that the members of the opposition continually bring up about this budget. I actually sympathise with them because they have to get up here each day and trot out a 20-minute speech. It is very difficult to give a 20-minute speech when there is nothing to criticise. So their old minds go into overdrive. I suppose a few notes are churned out by some of the shadow ministers and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) to give those opposite points to raise. They say, `Scare them. Scare the Australian people. Say their children will have to pay for it. Say it is not a real budget. Say the figures are shonky.' That is what they are saying, but no-one is picking that up. It is not happening because this is a good budget and has been very well received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put on the record that I was one of those members who had a few criticisms about the budget last year and raised them with the relevant ministers. May I modestly claim that, along with some of my colleagues, some of my views were taken account of and certain modifications were made. Let me also put it on the record that it was a difficult budget last year. We on the government side appreciated it was, but we appreciated also that difficult decisions had to be taken. I strongly believe that it was the hard decisions taken in last year's budget that helped to shape this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hard decisions of last year were about maintaining the deficit reduction strategy. Those hard decisions of last year have produced a budget which will, as the Treasurer stated, maximise economic growth, reduce unemployment&mdash;I do not know where the opposition is getting its figures from that the budget will not reduce unemployment&mdash;promote social justice, which is something we do not hear too much about from those opposite, and reduce the budget deficit without any increase in taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose when we stand up in this place we always like to draw attention to successes, modest as they may be, in which we believe we have played a contributing part. In that way, modest as I always am in the chamber, I claim to have played a contributing part&mdash;no more than that&mdash;in three decisions taken within the budgetary context. The first one was to help right the wrongs done to merchant mariners who were exempt from the veterans' entitlement. Merchant mariners will now be entitled to the same benefits as veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a two-year campaign ably led by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). The honourable member deserves credit for his efforts. I had the honour to second the motion that he moved in 1992 when he introduced the bill. Let me put on the record that the opposition supported the bill. It was a bipartisan campaign. I remember that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) spoke very strongly on that matter in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soon after the 1993 election, the honourable member for Shortland reintroduced that motion. Again, I had the honour to second it. Again, the honourable member for Dawson and the honourable member for Hinkler spoke to it. It was such an important issue, we more or less made the same speeches as we made in the preceding year. Although it did not affect a lot of people, a great injustice was being done to those people who had served in the merchant fleet. They had not been given their true recognition and had not been entitled to the same entitlements received by veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who took this issue on board and righted a wrong. Righting that wrong will not win this side or the other side any votes. It affected very few people, but a great injustice had been done to a group of citizens in Australia. Members on both sides of the chamber saw that, and that wrong has now been rectified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I believe I played some small role in was the reduction in the fuel levy excise. It would not often be said in speeches in this place, but I believe that the reduction in the fuel levy excise was an unintended consequence of the last budget. Let me be generous&mdash;I am in a particularly generous mood&mdash;and pay tribute to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who rose in this chamber and drew attention to the fuel levy excise in speech after speech. Although the honourable member for Hume and I sometimes disagree on transport matters, on that matter&mdash;as I said in each of my speeches&mdash;I agreed with him wholeheartedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;and I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport (Mr O'Keefe), who is at the table, agrees with me&mdash;that the reforms undertaken in the Australian shipping industry, the lowering of crew levels, multiskilling, everything that has been achieved that we are so proud of, have made us world competitive. Despite what those opposite might say, we have a good record in Australian shipping. I believe that unintended consequence wiped out some of the gains that we made over 12 months. The charge has now been reduced by 2c, and that will save Australian shipping between $6 million and $8 million a year. That will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister made that decision. It was the correct decision. I am not too proud to say that the wrong decision was made in the preceding budget. When we have perceived that a wrong has been done to Australian industry, we are big enough to correct it and say, `We got that one wrong. We admit it and we will put it right.' We do not stand and defend it and keep it there; we correct it. That decision has been a great boost to Australian shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another decision that does not involve my electorate but which affects it greatly is the one in the white paper, released in the lead-up to the budget, about commencing work on Badgerys Creek.

I have reservations about selling off some of the airports in Australia, but I can see the logic of it. There would be no difficulty in selling off Tullamarine, Kingsford Smith, perhaps Coolangatta and a few airports that the government could profit from, but who would really want to buy&mdash;this is no disrespect to my Tasmanian friends&mdash;the Hobart or Launceston airports?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also worry that one reason for the sale is the funding of Badgerys Creek.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, I was in Taiwan. The potential for trade between this country and Taiwan is something that we have not even tapped. One real problem with trade is that countries become the flavour of the month.

Talk about putting all our eggs in the one basket; that is what we are constantly doing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons that I strongly supported the establishment of Badgerys Creek. </PARA>

It has the infrastructure. It is beside the freeway. There has already been an announcement that it will be linked to Kingsford Smith airport by another freeway. Provision has been made for a rail network. It could be the major freight airport of Australia. It is something that we have not had in this country. If we are going to be serious about it, we have to stop looking at our region narrowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) is at the table. He knows that I supported the inland port concept at Parkes.

We say our economic future is tied up with Asia. I have no argument with that at all. Our economic future is tied up with Asia. Geographically, we are part of Asia. It is time that we had the infrastructure in rail, road and air to take advantage of that.

If it were going to achieve those sorts of objectives, I am sure it would have been greeted with great enthusiasm by the Australian people. But, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, his whiteboard is still empty; nobody bothered to ring to say what a wonderful budget it was. The budget has made no impact on the Australian people at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My experience in my own office has been very similar to that of the honourable member for Throsby. The budget has created very little interest and very little enthusiasm. True, there have been calls from veterans who are concerned about the future of their entitlements because of the reductions in veterans expenditure that are included in the budget, and there are concerns about a number of other issues, but basically the budget has made a very limited impact.

Honourable members have heard of things like jobtrain, jobsearch, jobstart, newstart, skillshare, skillscope, CEP, SEVS, CDEP, NIES, LEAP, REAP, the job compact, CEIS, Nettforce, JET&mdash;the list just goes on and on. </PARA>

Great imagination is shown by the government in inventing new titles but, sadly, few of these schemes have achieved anything really worthwhile for the Australian people. I sometimes wonder whether they are designed to amuse the unemployed in the hope that some international recovery may sweep over the government's  incompetence and build some growth into our national economy in spite of the government's policies. None of these programs will achieve those objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have large numbers of unemployed it is important that they spend the time when they are not properly occupied in developing their skills, maintaining their spirits and developing strategies which may be helpful to them in the long term. So it is useful to have these sorts of programs. I am not critical of the job creation schemes on that score. What I am critical of is the flamboyant rhetoric that is usually associated with these schemes, rhetoric about what they are going to achieve in a worthwhile way for the Australian population, for the unemployed and for our national economy. In reality the grandiose rhetoric does not create jobs. The flamboyant claims do not create jobs. What we clearly need to do in this country is to develop the sorts of policies which create lasting productive work in the community and not just artificial jobs that last only as long as the taxpayers are prepared to keep paying the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed, have naturally become greatly discouraged after years of unemployment. No-one any longer believes the government when it comes out with yet another program that is going to solve the problems of the past. It is a bit like the boy who cried wolf. We have been promised so many times the magic pudding solution and yet it never occurs. I know that over the last month or two there have been some improved jobs statistics. They are welcome. However, it needs to be remembered that unemployment figures from now on are artificial because they do not accurately reflect the true number of people out of work. Those people who have been involved in training programs are no longer counted among the unemployed. Those who receive the new mature age allowance&mdash;the premature retirement scheme for the unemployed&mdash;are not counted as unemployed. Those involved in the artificial job creation schemes are not counted as unemployed. Those Aborigines working on the community development program are not counted as unemployed. Those who have been moved onto disability pensions and the like are not counted as unemployed. Those who have just given up looking are not counted as unemployed. Anyone who has worked for one hour in the previous week is not counted as unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when we add all of those people to the official 900,000 or thereabouts unemployed, the true number of those in Australia seeking work, seeking more meaningful employment, is very much higher indeed. There is nothing in this budget that will offer any hope to those who are unemployed that there may be a better future ahead. There is nothing for their job prospects. I ask the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, what I am to say to the 11.8 per cent of the people of Wide Bay, my electorate, who are out of work&mdash;up to 22 per cent in some of the larger centres in the electorate. What hope is there for them in this budget? They do not want any more training programs and they do not want early retirement; they want real productive jobs so that they can contribute to the national economy, so that they can help build real wealth, and so are able not only to plan for their own future but also contribute to their community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centrepiece of this budget is the alleged 4.5 per cent growth that our economy is going to achieve over the next 12 months, a growth largely built on improved international activity. But central to this growth is a 14 1/2 per cent increase in business investment. Yet there are no measures in the budget to actually stimulate such business investment. There is nothing there to encourage business to go out and invest, to build this increase in the national economy around which the budget is based. Indeed, perhaps the only measure that has been around over recent times to stimulate investment, the investment allowance, will be axed from the end of this month. There will be no investment allowance, no incentive to invest whatsoever. The only thing that is in this budget for business is higher taxes. That is the typical Labor recipe for the future&mdash;more taxes, as though somehow or other the more revenue the government collects the better off the nation is. The typical ALP budget strategy is spend more, tax more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I notice that even the Labor government now is concerned about the philosophy behind its budget. The headline in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> was, `Government gets jitters over economy'. If it has not got the jitters about the economy and about its own budget, it certainly ought to. Foreign debt is up. The government's answer to that will apparently be a new education program to try to persuade the Australian people that a debt of $244 billion somehow or other does not matter. Investment is down. In spite of the fact that this budget is built on increased investment, the first figures that come out after the budget show a decline in business investment. The trade figures remain woeful. Once again, the worst part of those figures is the failure for there to be any improvement in relation to imports of plant and equipment, which were supposed to be the centrepiece of our business growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates are set to rise. The government's response? The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is starting on a new bank bashing exercise, blaming the banks because the government has once again let the economy get out of control. The industrial relations legislation is so discouraging employers from even considering adding to their work force that any prospects of job growth are being killed off right at the beginning. This horrific type of legislation provides no incentive whatsoever for business to invest. Business investment of 14 1/2 per cent is totally unrealistic when the government's own policies seem to be designed to quell investment rather than to encourage it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is the biggest taxing budget in our national history. The Treasurer told us on budget night that there were no new taxes in this budget. That is not entirely true; there are new taxes on aviation, there are new taxes on businesses, there is a threatened new tax on the fishing industry and a range of other similar measures. But the government did not need to introduce new taxes in this budget given all the new taxes which were in last year's budget, many of which only take effect in this financial year. Many of them are indexed so there are guaranteed increases in the budget revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget demonstrates very powerfully the effect of indexation and bracket creep. If governments do not actually reduce tax rates every year they collect more revenue just by relying on the natural growth in the community and inflation. So, in spite of a no new taxes budget, personal income tax receipts are up by 8 per cent, company tax is up 7 per cent, superannuation funds taxes are up 27 per cent, sales tax revenue is up 8 per cent, fuel excise is up another 13 per cent, and fringe benefits tax is up a whopping 131 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these massive rises in tax revenue will mean that for the first time in our national history a government will collect over $100 billion in tax revenue from the Australian people&mdash;$103.3 billion. All this has been achieved without any public new taxes. In reality, though, there is an enormous increase in the depth to which Labor's tax office will reach into every Australian's pocket to collect more revenue for the government's big spending programs. The government that gave us capital gains tax, fringe benefits tax, bank debits tax, superannuation taxes, training guarantee levies, Medicare levies, resource rent taxes, HECS payments and a whole range of others will dig further into our pockets to collect even more revenue for its big spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the $100 billion that the government is collecting from taxpayers this year, there will still be an $11.7 billion budget deficit. That is an enormous future debt which will have to be carried by future generations of Australian taxpayers. The government would have had to increase taxes on every working Australian by $2,000 just to balance this year's budget&mdash;let alone doing anything about the debt that has been accumulated over previous years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most frightening economic statistic coming out of this budget is that, by the end of this financial year, the Commonwealth government's own debt will be $96 billion. One of the biggest increases in this year's budget is a 36 per cent increase in the cost of servicing the government's own debt. This $96 billion has grown from $30 billion in just five years due to the government's big spending programs which will have to be paid for by future generations of Australian taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time in our national history we have had a decade of Labor government. In the past we have had short, intermittent periods of big spending and poor management by a Labor government. This country has now experienced 10 years of appalling economic management, and the legacy of that already is $96 billion worth of debt which future generations will have to repay. This federal government is going down exactly the same spending path as did Burke and Lawrence in Western Australia, Cain and Kirner in Victoria, Bannon in South Australia, Wran in New South Wales and, of course, Goss in Queensland. The government has big spending programs, but it concentrates that expenditure on social engineering, top-heavy bureaucracies and empty welfare. It does nothing to rebuild the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We still have a $2.4 billion target for asset sales. The government has never achieved its targets for asset sales in the past, and no-one really believes that it will do it this time. In this budget it is selling Qantas for the third time. It has never achieved its objective. We have just heard the honourable member for Throsby saying that he will lie down in front of the sale of airports. That again throws this particular part of the budget estimates into disarray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particularly alarming feature of the sale of government assets relates to where the money will actually go. I think it is reasonable to sell off many government assets. It is quite acceptable to put forward an argument that there is no reason why the government needs to be the owner of some of these assets. But when we sell off our assets to pay this year's unemployment benefits, we are clearly going downhill. When we sell off the back paddock to pay this year's bills, we are clearly destroying our revenue opportunities for the future and damaging the government's capacity to balance future budgets. If $2.4 billion were being spent on building new national infrastructure or developing a strategy to guarantee our national future, then I would be supporting it. But this $2.4 billion will be all gone at the end of the year. It will be used to pay this year's unemployment benefits. That is clearly a nonsense strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other very disappointing aspects of this particular budget is the government's response to regional development. The government led us to believe that its Kelty report was going to welcome a new era of commitment to regional issues, that the profile of these matters would be raised and that the government would make a real commitment to redressing some of the imbalance and unfairness that its policies currently direct towards regional Australia. The Kelty report was a glossy publication of four volumes. It really was little more than a multi-billion dollar wish list. It promised ports, airports, railways and a four-lane highway from Adelaide to Cairns. They are all wonderful projects. Many of them are thoroughly worthy of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government provided towards this multibillion dollar wish list, this new turnaround in government attitudes towards regional Australia? It has provided a miserable $10 million, followed by $20 million in subsequent years. So these billions and billions of dollars worth of projects approved by the Kelty report will have to compete for a miserable $10 million. Is that not an extraordinary response compared with the $800 million that was made available for the better cities fantasy? In fact, $200 million of this year's budget is allocated to building better cities, but only $10 million is allocated to building a better regional Australia. That says something about the government's priorities when it comes to building a better country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About $71 million is provided in the budget for urban and regional development, but $25 million of that will be spent in Canberra. Labor's definition of regional Australia seems to be that Canberra comes first and any money left over can go to the rest of the nation. It is quite clear that Labor's regional affairs policy is only empty rhetoric. There are glossy publications, but there is nothing really there to back up the empty words. Certainly regional Australia feels very depressed about the government's response to the crucial issues affecting their part of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's promised commitment to expenditure in regional Australia is entirely wiped out by perhaps one of the most appalling aspects of the budget; that is, the enormous rise in fuel excise revenue. Under this budget, Labor will take more from regional Australia in the form of extra fuel excise than it will return by way of infrastructure or other contributions. That clearly indicates what the government thinks of regional Australia: it is a source of fuel excise revenue. The government is only interested in where it can get the taxes from. It is not interested in its contribution to the national economy and what it can do to help build a better Australia. </PARA>

First of all, those opposite talk about $820 million being allocated by the federal government to roads with $10 billion being collected in the form of excises, registrations and licences around the country. Much more than $820 million of taxpayers' money is going to roads. Because of the premiers' agreement with the former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, general revenue funds are now going to roads and being spent by the states. This sort of misleading remark does nothing to further the progress of government in Australia. It does not mention the benefits of the federal system that we now have. All sorts of misleading statements can be made.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is being paid by taxpayers all over Australia, by people who contribute to Medicare through their levies. The total expenditure on roads is approximately $4.7 billion. It is quite clear that what is being spent on roads is roughly what is being received from roads by all levels of government throughout Australia. So we should not be too misleading about the transfer of funds from one government to another and the effect of that.

It gives them great opportunities, it gives the nation great opportunities and it gives our local regions great opportunities.

It is important that we develop aquaculture: there are proposals being developed along the south-east coast of New South Wales and in other areas of Australia. Perry Smith, in the latest Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics report, has said that the key factor for the fishing industry is whether supplies from aquaculture can be increased from present levels. Production promotions have been falling. Mr Smith said that Australia is in a good strategic position to capitalise on the opportunities that will be presented over the next few years on both export and domestic markets.

This has added depth to the market through a greater variety of selling mechanisms. As well as that, changes to the western European economy are feeding through; western Europe is buying more wool.

In my speech on last year's appropriation bill I addressed the question of the reform of the United Nations system, with particular emphasis on its peacekeeping activities. Nine months later I very much regret to say that there has been little progress towards a more effective United Nations peacekeeping capability. In particular, the continuing tragedies in Bosnia and now Rwanda appear to mock UN efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Goaded by the Bosnian Serb siege of the UN declared safe haven of Gorazde, in April the international community increased pressure on the factions in Bosnia to reach a negotiated solution. A contact group comprising the United States, Russia and the European Community nations was established to coordinate the international approach to peacekeeping and peace negotiations in former Yugoslavia. This symbolised the emergence of a new international consensus and resolve on the issue. Russian involvement had previously been instrumental in bringing about the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the United Nations Security Council agreed to the dispatch of a further 6,500 United Nations troops to former Yugoslavia, demonstrating the UN's continuing commitment to peacekeeping. The Security Council also agreed to broaden NATO's mandate to permit air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces and weapons threatening UN declared safe havens, demonstrating the UN's increased determination to use force against Bosnian Serb defiance of the United Nations. This marked a significant increase in the UN's willingness to use force against those who flout its directives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations brokered by the United States aimed at establishing a federation between the Bosnian Muslims and Croats were crowned with success when on 11 May agreement was reached on the shape that the new federation would take. The Bosnian parliament is currently meeting to ratify the agreement. One could have reasonably hoped that this renewed concentration by the international community on the situation in Bosnia would have borne fruit. Unfortunately, as I speak, the prospects for peace in Bosnia are not noticeably closer than they were a month ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week the contact group met with representatives of the Muslim-Croat federation and the Bosnian Serbs in France. At issue was the proposed division of Bosnia-Herzegovina between the two sides, as well as a proposal for an extended cease-fire. But these talks produced no agreement. UN brokered talks on the same issues are set to resume in Geneva on 2 June. But Bosnian President Izetbegovic has already cast doubts over Muslim-Croat participation on the grounds that the Bosnian Serb army continues to maintain troops in the exclusion zone around Gorazde. Against this depressing background, there have been renewed threats by the French and the British, who provide the bulk of the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia&mdash;UNPROFOR, as it is referred to&mdash;that they will withdraw their troops by the end of the year unless substantial progress has been made towards a settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy on former Yugoslavia has three key elements: support for all UN action in support of a negotiated solution, and the provision by Australia of humanitarian relief; support for the UN arms embargo on the grounds that its lifting would endanger UN peacekeepers in Bosnia and jeopardise UN humanitarian relief activities; and agreement with the government's refusal to commit Australian military personnel to UNPROFOR. The coalition does appreciate the great difficulties&mdash;extreme difficulties&mdash;that the UN has been labouring under in former Yugoslavia and at present sees no viable alternative to the policy outlined above. On each and every point one could raise differing arguments, and there is a balance either side of it, but at the moment we hold to the policy the key elements of which I have just enunciated. But the fact that key players like France and Britain have come to the despairing conclusion that they may have to withdraw from UNPROFOR underlies the urgency of the need for the international community to find more effective ways of intervening in such conflicts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy in Rwanda continues and the part the international community has played&mdash;not so much in trying to alleviate the suffering of refugees who have fled the country, but in attempting to protect internally displaced persons and to ensure the delivery of humanitarian assistance inside the country&mdash;has raised fresh questions about the capacity of the United Nations to react effectively to such crises. I have already stated elsewhere that the coalition supports the government's decision to provide $1.5 million in emergency relief assistance to Rwandan refugees. Indeed, I specifically called upon the government to provide such assistance. I have also called upon the government to keep the situation under review so that it can provide further assistance as required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reaction to the UN's request for contributions has ranged from the positive to the cautious. Initially, Senator Gareth Evans undertook to view the UN request `very sympathetically' but, on 24 May, Senator Ray said that government policy had changed. Senator Ray said that Australia would now only contribute, firstly, if the United Nations had a clear mission; secondly, if the UN had a clear timetable for any commitment; and, thirdly, if a political resolution process between the Rwandan government and the RPF were in place. Even then, Senator Ray said, Australian Defence Force personnel would be committed only if their security were to be `assured'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to make too much of the contrast between Senator Evans's initial reaction and Senator Ray's more measured approach. But I will mention that, again in my speech on last year's appropriation bill, I pointed out that there was a contradiction between the activist approach to peacekeeping advocated by Senator Evans in his blue book, published last year, and Senator Ray's distinctly cautious view of such activism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition appreciates the need for caution. It absolutely appreciates such a caution&mdash;there are lives at stake&mdash;before committing Australian Defence Force personnel to situations where they might be at risk. I have already stated elsewhere that it would be premature for Australia to commit military personnel without knowing details of the structure, composition and command arrangements. Nevertheless, the coalition remains disposed in favour of Australia fulfilling its international responsibilities in Rwanda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray has already commented on the reasons for the delay in the government coming to a decision on whether Australia should make a contribution and, if it did, what form the contribution should take. But, given the fact that there is widespread concern about the plight of the people of Rwanda to the extent that organisations such as Community Aid Abroad and Care Australia have advocated an Australian commitment to the United Nations force, I call upon the government to explain in detail the factors influencing its consideration of the issue. I assume it has a great deal to do with the UN itself not making up its mind, which is part of the problem I was touching on earlier; and I assume that it also has to do with the disagreement between the UN and the US as to what the UN Secretary-General had in mind when he met with the US President last week. But the parliament needs to be told and the people ought to be informed. </PARA>

I do not say this with any pleasure because I am a great supporter of the UN system&mdash;as a former Vice-President of the United Nations General Assembly, it gives me no pleasure to reflect on an organisation to which I am committed&mdash;but it needs significant improvement. Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia all posed the UN challenges on questions such as national sovereignty and the organisation of international forces that it has been quite unable to meet to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Cambodia, however, is one where the intervention of the United Nations was highly successful. But, regrettably, it also illustrates that even the best efforts of the UN cannot overcome intractable domestic political disputes. A year after United Nations supervised elections, the situation in Cambodia is failing to fulfil expectations of stability and prosperity generated by the election of the coalition CPP-Funcinpec government and the emergence of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who are aware of their history, particularly Khmer history, Cambodian history and recent history, it is a chilling fact that the Khmer Rouge in certain areas now has a presence further inside Cambodia than it has had at any stage since the Vietnamese invasion of 1979. The coalition has already publicly supported the government's decision to consider Cambodia's request for appropriate military assistance to help defend the new government against the Khmer Rouge. The coalition has also called on the government to provide adequate development assistance, including for de-mining, to Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of grave international concern beyond Cambodia and our own region is that of North Korea. Reports in recent days that North Korea has removed fuel from a reactor at Yongbyon, without international monitors being present, have again raised the possibility of United Nations sanctions being imposed upon Pyongyang. In such a delicate situation, the coalition calls on all parties concerned to resolve their differences through dialogue and negotiation. But, again, North Korea's brinkmanship has posed the United Nations a challenge to which that organisation has no ready answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that, with the threat of global nuclear war diminished&mdash;but not, it must be stressed, eliminated entirely&mdash;it is the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons that now poses the greatest nuclear threat to regional peace and stability. North Korea is strongly suspected of developing nuclear weapons and is developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering them onto targets in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China. North Korea epitomises the dangers of nuclear proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the coalition believes it to be of the utmost importance that international mechanisms to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons be strengthened. In this regard, the coalition supports the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty, which is coming up for review in 1995; accelerating the work on a comprehensive test ban treaty; the missile technology control regime; and the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Building international support for these international treaties and organisations and ensuring compliance with them are our best hopes for containing nuclear proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conflict in Bougainville, though outside the purview of the United Nations, also raises the question of the role the international community can play in ending conflicts. The key elements of the coalition's policy on Bougainville remain, firstly, concern over allegations of human rights abuses by the Papua New Guinea defence force and the Bougainville revolutionary army and, secondly, support for Papua New Guinea sovereignty and territorial integrity, including its right to conduct its internal affairs without external interference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is concerned about allegations of human rights abuses on Bougainville by both the Papua New Guinea defence force and the BRA. The coalition has consistently called on the government to urge the Papua New Guinea government to observe internationally accepted human rights standards. The coalition does not accept, however, allegations that Australia has materially contributed to an ongoing `state of civil war' on Bougainville. It does not accept the view that Papua New Guinea defence force operations on Bougainville have only or even largely been made possible because of the provision of military equipment by Australia or Australian military assistance to the Papua New Guinea government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has consistently called on all parties to the conflict on Bougainville to work towards a negotiated solution to that conflict and will support any initiative towards that end. The coalition welcomed Prime Minister Wingti's decision to invite an Australian parliamentary delegation to visit Bougainville and participated in it. Senator Calvert and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) from the coalition were in the delegation. I would have liked to attend, but I had to be elsewhere. The coalition also supported the government's recent decision to offer up to $10 million, matching a contribution by the Papua New Guinea government, to rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts on Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have noted Deputy Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan's 27 May proposal that a South Pacific peacekeeping force, drawn from Fiji, Tonga and Vanuatu, be deployed in Bougainville. Such a force could help establish a climate in which negotiations aimed at bringing about a political resolution to the dispute between the Papua New Guinea government and the BRA could achieve progress. I have seen reports that the Papua New Guinea government will ask the Australian government for funding and logistic support for the initiative. I also understand that, as yet, no formal request has been made. If it were to be made, the coalition would be likely to endorse Australia providing such assistance for a South Pacific peacekeeping force. Sir Julius's proposal is a welcome demonstration of Papua New Guinea's flexibility and resolve to reach a negotiated solution to the Bougainville crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning now to the United Nations, I am concerned that its 50th anniversary is drawing closer but it seems increasingly unlikely we can achieve the full reform agenda by the time of the 50th birthday. Meanwhile, domestic concern is growing in Australia with respect to United Nations treaties. There has been a steady increase in the number of United Nations treaties entered into by Australia during the last 10 years of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Major industry groups, as an example, have expressed concerns that the government does not follow a sufficiently open approach to foreign treaty making&mdash;and I have considerable sympathy with those views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear and a growing problem associated with the lack of accountability to parliament for treaties entered into by the executive.

Additionally, the High Court's extended interpretation of the external affairs power under the constitution has enormously expanded the power of the Commonwealth government to override the states, thus compelling a change in the way the Commonwealth government enters into treaties; it compels the need for reform of the way in which it enters into treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the fact is that UN treaties, being multilateral solutions to worldwide problems, do not necessarily reflect the full extent of Australia's particular interests in these problems. We have limited input into, and limited control over, the drafting of such treaties and, as Senator Gareth Evans admitted in Senate estimates hearings last week, we win some and we lose some. Recently, for example, on the Basel convention on hazardous waste Australia simply got rolled, to put it bluntly. Yet our accession to such treaties can seriously compromise Australia's legal independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has shown concern about potential intrusion into our legal system resulting from the so-called optional protocol of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which enables Australians to take complaints to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. Private industry concerns have also been expressed with respect to the Australian negotiating position on a number of international environmental issues. It is most disturbing that, despite the government's repeated claims that it consults extensively with the full range of non-government groups interested in these matters, what I repeatedly hear is that these consultation processes are neither sufficient nor effective, and when they ultimately prove ineffective, as they did on the Basel convention, the government blames industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The onus is in fact fully and squarely on the government, and only the government, to ensure that Australia's overall national interests are protected in such matters and that effective processes of consultation are in place. Under some pressure on this issue, Senator Gareth Evans has recently introduced some minor bureaucratic changes in the treaty making processes. He has agreed, for example, to table a short explanatory document setting out the objectives and describing the nature of the particular convention concerned at the time when the bill implementing any such convention is introduced into parliament. This is just not good enough. This is just not soon enough in the process. Public debate should take place as early as practicable, preferably before negotiating positions are finalised. At the very least, parliament, and indeed the general public, should be informed before the point of ratification, and the states must be fully involved in the negotiating process from the start. As a strong personal supporter of the UN system, as I have said, and with long experience in the area, I find the present situation most unsatisfactory, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much welcome this week's announcement that the Prime Minister will hold a round table with industry and environment representatives on the United Nations climate change convention. The coalition is committed to achievement of sustainable development and committed, in particular, to the objectives of the climate change convention. But, in my view, cabinet needs urgently to reconsider Australia's position and to finetune its approach to defending our economic and trade competitiveness interests under the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As consensus emerges among the OECD countries to implement additional policy response measures to climate change, the existing caveat to Australia's negotiating position will no longer prove sufficient to protect our specific national interests, which is why the issue of equitable burden sharing is so important and why it is perfectly ridiculous for Senator Gareth Evans to be so proud of his comment in Senate Estimates Committee A on 25 May that the government has `flagged' its `concern' on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate today on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95. I find it difficult to isolate the topics that I would like to talk about because in both the  Working Nation white paper and the federal budget brought down a couple weeks ago by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) there are so many positive initiatives that this government has outlined for tackling unemployment and other important major social issues that it would be doing an injustice to try to cover all of them. In the few moments that I have in this House I would like to concentrate on a couple of key areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk about some of the important employment initiatives that were contained in the white paper and that have been funded in the Commonwealth budget. Of particular interest to me are those initiatives that I know from personal experience have had great success in the past and that have been considerably expanded. One area that has been given a significant boost in the budget and in the Working Nation document is new work opportunities in the environment. That boost is given in a number of ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has determined that the environment sector will be a key target area for new work opportunities. There is a new initiative in this area called the regional environment employment program. It will support regional consortiums of community groups, landcare groups, government and business to provide work experience and training in strategic environmental management and restoration projects. We already have in place a program along this line called LEAP, the landcare and environment action program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had the opportunity and the pleasure to see a number of very successful LEAP projects started and completed in my electorate of Moreton. Just a couple of weeks ago I participated in a number of LEAP projects which involved cleaning up and restoring waterways, creeks and parks. It also involved the replanting of major new Australian native trees to replace some of the weeds and overgrown areas along those parks in suburbs such as Corinda. There is a major program at Nosworthy Park, where a number of young people have been involved in restoring an important community asset and making it, again, a viable asset for the whole community to enjoy. That has also occurred at Mount Gravatt, Sunnybank and a number of other places in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about LEAP is that it involves young people. It is targeted at employing 15- to 19-year-olds who have been long-term unemployed and who have had no opportunities to gain work experience. The LEAP program involves active on-site work in cleaning up our community and planting trees and it also incorporates training in horticulture through environmental management programs. So it is a combined education program and work experience program which lasts for six months. Every person I have met&mdash;and I have talked to over 40 people in my electorate&mdash;who has been involved in this program has found it to be a very successful and viable program. I am pleased that in the federal budget and in the Working Nation document there has been a significant boost to the number of programs that will be funded over the next four years under LEAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional environment employment program, which will incorporate programs such as LEAP, is very important because not only does it get people actively working in the community fulfilling meaningful jobs but it also benefits the community by improving and cleaning up important valuable community assets such as waterways, creeks, parks, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also funded research by the Australian Conservation Foundation for further green jobs opportunities in the areas of waste and water management, ecotourism and energy auditing. The government funded that last financial year and funding will be extended into this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commitment has been made for the ACF to test the research by placing 100 unemployed people in green jobs to obtain work experience and training through the jobskills program. The jobskills program is also a very important program which has been involved in giving training and employment opportunities to young people as well as cleaning up our community. Again, there has been a very successful jobskills program in the Toohey forest, in the electorate of Moreton. There are so many initiatives in the Working Nation document that bring great credit to this government. I am pleased to give my strong support to those initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased about the additional support that has been given to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander job seekers in this budget. I have the privilege of chairing the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs and my colleague the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne) is a member. In the period that I have been on that committee we have visited many Aboriginal communities which are involved with CDEPs, community development employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These programs involve the local community getting together to bring about community improvements in the local area. The community takes charge of the unemployed in the area, looks at the areas of need in the local community, trains people and gets the local unemployed people working in the community to improve the resources and the facilities that are available in that community. It is basically a work for the dole scheme, but it is a scheme that is run voluntarily and it works very successfully. It means that in those Aboriginal communities the community and all the members in it are working together to benefit both the individuals within that community and the community as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very successful program and one that all Aboriginal communities around Australia have wanted to be involved with. I am pleased that in the budget and in the white paper there are measures for the considerable expansion of CDEP programs plus an additional $108.7 million provided over four years to ATSIC to expand and enhance employment and enterprise programs. The government will also be expanding the TAP program, the training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander program, by giving it a further $190 million over the next four years. This will allow an additional 25,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to gain work experience in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of very positive initiatives in this budget. I know a number of my colleagues have spent time in this House talking about the range of other initiatives, but I wanted to give credit to the government for emphasising the importance of both the environment and Aboriginal employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now talk about the important initiatives in the budget relating to health and the land acquisition fund. There have been a lot of statements made of late about how much or how little money the government is putting towards Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Those opposite have engaged in a bit of a political campaign, trying to attack the government on the amount of money it is committing to Aboriginal health. They have dared to criticise this government for the fact that it is increasing the amount of money for Aboriginal health by almost $500 million over the next five years. I find it quite ludicrous that the opposition would have the gall to come into this place and criticise this substantial increase in commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that we need a larger amount than that, and as part of this government I will certainly continue to fight for more funds. The opposition gains no credibility at all by coming into this place and attacking our programs to expend money on Aboriginal health. One just has to remember what the opposition had in its policy when it went to the last election. I know very well what the opposition was going to do. We only need to read Fightback&mdash;I know the Minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), could slip Fightback out of the Prime Minister's drawer if he wanted; I know it will be in there, easily able to be exposed to public scrutiny&mdash;to see that the opposition was going to cut $90 million a year off Aboriginal programs, including employment, housing, education and health programs. It was going to cut $90 million a year at least from directly targeted Aboriginal programs as well as targeting Aboriginal communities in its attacks on social welfare programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compare that to what this government is doing. We are not going to cut by $90 million a year; we are boosting by $100 million a year programs just in Aboriginal health&mdash;let alone the moneys I outlined before that will be allocated to employment programs, CDEP and others. This is the big contrast that this community and the people of Australia need to recognise when listening to the politics that the opposition plays with regard to Aboriginal affairs in this country. Its rhetoric does not match its performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that in this budget there has been a $500 million boost to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. But I place on the public record once more this important point: the Commonwealth is not solely responsible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health nor is ATSIC solely responsible. As chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs I have already tabled in this House two reports which commented on the need for much greater coordination between all Commonwealth and state agencies in the delivery of services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is demonstrated more in the health area than in any other area. A lot of money is being provided by the Commonwealth to state and territory governments to deliver health services to all Australians. But, unfortunately, it appears to the government that a lot of state and territory governments are not providing the appropriate emphasis to Aboriginal communities in the provision of health services, whether they be direct medical services or environmental health services such as water supply, decent housing and garbage collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to many Aboriginal communities across the length and breadth of this country, and wherever I have gone I have found that the local government authority or the state government has not put in place the types of resources that are required for that community. There is an expectation that ATSIC will look after everything. ATSIC is only given complementary funding to top up particular areas of disadvantage and need. It is not there to deliver mainstream services in every area of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All other government departments at the state and federal level have the responsibility to deliver services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as well as all other Australians. We need to recognise that this $500 million boost to Aboriginal health should be a complement to the existing funding that is provided both to the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health and to the state and territory departments of health. We need to get them working more fully with Aboriginal and Islander communities to target those areas of great disadvantage and great need. We need a much better level of coordination across state and federal agencies to ensure that those agencies are all identifying the appropriate resources that are required and putting those resources in place in those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not think that this $500 million boost to health over the next five years for Aboriginal and Islander people is going to solve everything. It certainly is not. There is still a long way to go. We also need to make sure that every dollar spent is spent appropriately and targeted properly and that the moneys that are currently allocated to all government agencies are spent where they are supposed to be spent&mdash;that is, for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as well as other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great disappointment to me that those opposite have chosen to oppose the land acquisition fund&mdash;an important initiative contained in the budget. It reflects badly on the current coalition. For many years in this place there has been a bipartisan position on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander welfare and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land acquisition fund is not the first example of the federal government being involved in establishing funds to purchase properties or land for Aboriginal people. In fact, in 1974 the Whitlam government's Aboriginal Land Fund Bill enabled the Aboriginal affairs department to purchase cattle properties or other areas of land, outside of reserve land that had already been set aside for Aboriginal people, so that Aboriginal people could be engaged in farming techniques or other forms of economic development for their communities. The 1974 bill flowed from a commitment of the McMahon Liberal-Country Party government to give Aboriginal people `the opportunity of access to specific areas of land to use and develop for economic and social purposes'. The former member for Gwydir, Ralph Hunt, in his contribution to the debate, said of the original government process:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the reserves of the Northern Territory&mdash;and there are 92,000 square miles of them&mdash;we have, I think, one-third of the Aboriginal people. The areas are encompassed by the boundaries of these reserves were arbitrarily drawn by white legislators. They took no account of the conflicting needs or rights of the Aboriginal clans at all. We always sensed that there would be some difficulty in trying to apply this land rights principle to Aborigines living off reserves. To overcome that problem it was resolved that we should set up a land fund to buy for Aborigines off reserves both in the Northern Territory and in the States.</PARA>
<PARA>The 1974 Aboriginal Land Fund Bill was supported by the coalition and the Labor government. It was a smaller version of what we are considering today. The land acquisition fund provided for in this budget is about providing for the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who have been totally dispossessed of their land an opportunity to recover some of that land and to be involved once more in the land that they find so important to their spiritual and cultural needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central objective of the land fund is to encourage greater self-reliance for indigenous people and to remedy the past injustices that no-one in this place could disagree have occurred to them. The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Deaths in Custody highlighted this point very succinctly in describing the levels of disposession and disempowerment when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Colonial takeover denied Aboriginal people the right to live by their own rules, to decide their own policies. They were denied to run their own economic and family life. They were also denied the right to own land, to earn secure living as farmers, as merchants, or in the labour market at their own discretion, to earn a family wage, to receive welfare benefits, to live where they pleased. Under various policies their private reproductive lives were under scrutiny by government and missionary officials. They could not necessarily marry the person they chose, fraternise with people of their choice, speak to people of a certain skin colour, live in a particular street or on a particular reserve. They could not decide how many people they shared their house with. They were not eligible for old age pensions, for workers' compensation, for maternity allowances or child endowment. Even when legislation on such matters changed in the 1940s and 1950s, it was often the manager of the mission or reserve rather than the individual who was paid this money. They could not run their own bank accounts. Anyone who objected could end up hundreds of kilometres away or imprisoned for an unknown time. After release, they could be again banished from their families. The law extended its arm into the bedroom and the post-natal ward. Children were taken from their mothers after birth, others were taken once they reached the age of three or four years. Many Aboriginal families were thus denied the right to nurture, to rear and educate, to love their own children, to see them grow up. They lost these children, and the children became lost themselves. Who were they? Often children had been taught to detest everything Aboriginal, and this could extend to themselves once they realised that their skin was not white.</PARA>
<PARA>This quote comes from the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I think it sums up the massive level of dispossession and injustice that Aboriginal people have suffered. I recognise that the government should address many areas dealing with Aboriginal needs, including health, education and housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have to understand&mdash;this was significant in the Native Title Act and the Mabo decision of the High Court&mdash;that we cannot build a fairer and more decent society for Aboriginal people until we end the basic injustices that they have suffered over the 205 years of colonial European rule in this country. When we came here, we took the land off Aboriginals. Mabo recognised at long last that they were here; that they did exist; that they had possession of this land; and that we took it off them. Mabo ended the fiction that they did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To improve upon that, we now have to act to restore some of that dispossession and give Aboriginal people some semblance of rights in our community. That is why we need to address the land acquisition fund as well as health, housing and education issues. Unless we address their rights of ownership of land and that basic tenet of their social and cultural life, we cannot succeed in dealing with other important issues. I am delighted that the land acquisition fund has been supported and introduced in this budget. I urge the coalition to reassess its position and to think carefully. It should look back at its position of the last 30 or 40 years and at the fact that we have had that bipartisan support.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer (Mr Willis) claims that this budget will maximise economic growth, reduce unemployment, promote social justice and reduce the budget deficit without increasing taxes. What an incredible set of goals and objectives this budget sets out to achieve! Just in one document in one year the government expects to maximise economic growth, to reduce unemployment, to promote social justice and to reduce the budget deficit without increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that has passed since the budget was introduced&mdash;in that time we have had the response from the then Leader of the Opposition&mdash;there has been a significant slump of investment of over seven per cent. So the basis on which the budget was founded, a growth of 14.5 per cent in business investment, is starting to cause some concern in financial circles. People are worrying whether the budget will hang together. In terms of maximising economic growth at this point, there is a real question mark over whether the government's targets for growth will be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reduction in unemployment is a government goal, but  it seems to me that it is more an objective of fancy bookkeeping&mdash;training, education and work experience&mdash;than real jobs and real opportunities to participate in the workplace. In my view there does not appear to be a real growth in jobs, which is claimed by the government to be one of its objectives. The government claims it wants to reduce unemployment. It will actually reduce the number of people on unemployment lists and in statistics, but it will not reduce the number of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget, it is claimed, promotes social justice. I have dealt with the Aboriginal matter. As I said, three or four times the amount being spent on health is being spent to provide land for Aboriginals. This is more than is spent on important matters such as giving them the right to survive and enjoy decent health. I cannot understand the government's priorities in this area. Surely nothing should be more important to the government, which claims to understand this issue, than providing for the wellbeing of people. I cannot see the social justice in not providing real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last goal, that of reducing the budget deficit without increasing taxes, Budget Paper No. 1 clearly shows an increase in revenue of 7.9 per cent. So the government is clearly increasing taxes. In the sales tax area alone, in one year there is a 43 per cent increase in sales tax. Inflation will go up by about 1.4 per cent&mdash;let us run it out to two per cent. The government's increase in revenue is four times the increase in inflation. There is no equity in this, and there is certainly an increase in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On those four goals one would have to say that there is doubt already about the maximisation of economic growth, and there is real doubt about whether the government is serious in reducing unemployment. There cannot be any other than a very biased, jaundiced point of view about whether social justice is being delivered by the budget. One would have to be a member of the politically correct and elite Labor Party to understand its thoughts on social justice. For example, the government thinks it is politically correct to smoke marijuana but not tobacco. That is the sort of thing Labor is promoting in this House. I cannot follow that logic, nor can I follow the logic of promoting social justice, as outlined in the budget, whether it be with jobs or with the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at this budget to see whether it really measures up to the needs of the Australian people, I have taken two documents of advice submitted to the government. The first one, containing budget proposals, was put to the Australian government by the Salvation Army of Australia, and is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Budget Submission to Commonwealth Government 1994-95</EMPHASIS>. Nobody could doubt the authenticity of the Salvation Army. The other submission put to the government that I will look at is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a creative innovative manufacturing nation</EMPHASIS> by the Metal Trades Industry Association, which represents the manufacturing industries of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to measure the government's effort against two important groups in our community: the one that will supply jobs and the one that looks after the needy and those requiring welfare&mdash;the real hurt cases in Australia. We will see whether the government measures up to the objectives that it has laid down. The Salvation Army submission impresses this upon the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the focus of The Salvation Army in preparing this Submission is upon the long-term well-being of those in our society who are most disadvantaged and least able to advocate for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>Every Australian would understand that the Salvation Army, along with other organisations, truly represents that group. I do not claim that it is unique or exclusive in that area. St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family and many other groups do similar work to the Salvation Army. They seek to assist those in the most vital need. The Salvation Army submission, which was put to the government just before the budget, requests the government to take note of these things. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the revitalisation of our economy holds the potential for the gulf between the haves and have-nots to continue to widen, between those in employment, and those without a job.</PARA>
<PARA>One only has to look at the term of office of the Australian Labor Party to understand that that gulf has widened. The mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the few elite at the top have really benefited by the Labor Party. The bottom 10 per cent has gone backwards in their capacity to look after themselves and avoid poverty. So the haves and the have-nots have grown further apart. The Salvation Army is pleading with the government not to continue with the policies that have created that situation. The Salvation Army's presentation also states that, should the gap increase:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . significant numbers of Australians are likely to become trapped in poverty, creating an underclass which may have the dire personal and social consequences which have been witnessed overseas in parts of the United Kingdom and the United States of America.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure you will agree that Perth is a pretty open and beautiful city. There has been an avoidance of ghetto or slum type degraded land development in the inner city areas of Perth. In giving evidence in Perth, the Salvation Army said it believes that a permanent underclass has been established in Australia. The Australian Labor Party has brought that about. It said that it has occurred over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Salvation Army has pleaded with the government, through the budget, to not allow that to continue and to reverse the trend of creating a permanent underclass. The government does not acknowledge that, and nothing in the budget or the white paper seeks to rectify those problems. The Salvation Army submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Salvation Army is calling upon the Commonwealth Government and all members of the Australian Parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>everybody here&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that those Australians with whom The Salvation Army has day-to-day contact, who include the unemployed, the poor, the homeless, and those with psychiatric illness, have their needs addressed in tangible and effective responses.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us deal with the unemployed. The Salvation Army has said that employment is one of the most important things for giving people a sense of wellbeing and an opportunity to look after themselves. The vital part of its submission&mdash;the main text&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Salvation Army is concerned about the impact of unemployment on all Australians who are without employment, and supports strong action on the part of government, in cooperation with business and the community, to create real jobs which will supply sustainable employment.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has not met that objective in its budget and has not tried to. It is not interested in long-term employment. It is not concerned about the ability to employ or whether there is sustenance for families to continue to exist. All the government is doing in its budget and the white paper is providing training opportunities, fudging the figures and giving people an opportunity to learn more.

<PARA>That has been ignored completely. We have looked at the needs of people. Let us now look on the other hand at what those who supply jobs&mdash;the manufacturing industries of Australia&mdash;have said they wanted from the Australian government in the budget. The Metal Trades Industry Association has said that it wants a competitive macro environment&mdash;I guess that it means a competitive macro-economic environment&mdash;with a competitive Australian dollar, the maintenance of low interest rates and a competitive real interest rates structure. </PARA>

The government has claimed that it is low. The inflation rate of some of our competitors is slightly higher. For instance, the inflation rate of the United Kingdom and the United States is 0.5 and 0.7 per cent above the Australian inflation rate. Australia ranks with Canada, Finland, Japan, New Zealand and Norway in having equal or lower rates. But a large range of nations with whom we compete have similar inflation rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the interest rates charged in Australia, one sees a real difference. As far as interest rates are concerned, Australia is one of the countries with higher rates. In the OECD, only Italy and Spain are above Australia in terms of current interest rates. Things will move ahead and the metal trades industry will achieve the investment that is essential for the budget and for the objective of creating jobs, but one of the prime things that people want is competitive interest rates so they can borrow for plant, equipment and factories. The government is not supplying them, and it does not look like it is going to happen. Interest rates will rise. In comparative terms, Australia's investors are at a disadvantage if they are going to pursue the objectives that will create jobs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the last few days we have seen the government do a 180-degree turn on the industrial relations bill and redundancy arrangements simply because the costs to Australian employers were so great that they were actually going to de-employ. I do not know whether honourable members were aware of it, but many manufacturers were thinking of shedding staff so they would not be caught with huge redundancy payouts that would bankrupt their businesses. This is not an abuse of labour. Manufacturers and employers in Australia today are in such a tender state that anything that will impose additional costs or difficulties on them will cause them to close their doors. They are not going to stick around and continue to run a business for the returns that are there under the current government. </PARA>

That will be done by many of my colleagues and has already been done by some who have preceded me in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the key economic ministers&mdash;in particular, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), led by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;in bringing down what I consider to be a first-rate economic document, a document that has been extraordinarily well received by everyone within the community. Of course, there will be critics of any budget. Everyone will be able to point to particular elements of the budget with which they disagree, but I do not think anyone is really contesting the general broad economic thrust of the budget. That has been very clear to date in some of the contributions that we have heard from the opposition. Most of the debate from the opposition so far has been like being attacked with a wet lettuce over the wrist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I would like to make about the budget during my contribution this afternoon is in relation to some of the key moves in terms of regional development. Many of those moves were spelt out the week before the budget was handed down in the government's white paper Working Nation, but of course the appropriations for those initiatives were contained within this year's budget statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week of Working Nation, in Orange six local government authorities which make up an organisation within my electorate called the Central West Economic Development Group held what I consider to be an historic meeting. The councils of Blayney, Cabonne, Forbes, Lachlan, Orange and Parkes were each represented at that meeting by their mayor and general manager. These councils form what is essentially the geographical area covered by the Central West Economic Development Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That meeting pledged support for the Central West Economic Development Group as the regional vehicle for responding to the regional development initiatives that were contained in the federal government's white paper on employment and growth, and it backed the Central West Economic Development Group in pursuing funding as outlined in the white paper. This course of events may not necessarily steal the nation's headlines, but as far as I am concerned it is a very significant statement locally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day the white paper was released&mdash;that is, Wednesday, 4 May&mdash;the head of the Central West Economic Development Group, Mr Alex Ferguson, was quoted by the local media as saying that the central west was well placed to take up the front running in response to the government's regional development initiatives. I believe that that is a very true statement. Even during the worst impact of the most recent recession, because of the nature of the regional economy that I am privileged to represent, we were spared some of the worst impacts of the recession. As of the December quarter 1992, the unemployment levels right throughout my electorate were of the order of 6 1/2 per cent, compared with the national average of around 10 per cent, which gives some indication of the strength of that regional economy even in these reasonably early days of recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Mr Ferguson is spot-on when he talks about the opportunities for the central west to respond to those regional development initiatives. He went on to say that the group had been working very closely with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology for a number of years and that the policy statements in the white paper were no more or less than they had been talking about for the last six to nine months. However, he acknowledged that lack of cooperation from the various councils in the region could hamper these developments. He was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is obvious they&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the councils&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would need to start playing as a team to bring together 85,000 people and a great deal of wealth. The White Paper recognises that the very heart of regional development is the potential and ownership of projects by the community.</PARA>
<PARA>The very next day, the day after the white paper's release, the six local councils in question, which are all represented on the board of the Central West Economic Development Group, released a joint communique in which they confirmed that they would be moving forward together as a group to seek funding. Mr Ferguson was able to emerge from that meeting saying that the mayors had clearly acknowledged the imperatives for regional development and the need to get the ball rolling. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was quite a meeting, getting together the mayors of the region to meet and discuss something that is important to all their communities. They are enthusiastic about the combined strength of the Central West and the benefit of a united approach to development.</PARA>
<PARA>Such a united approach is precisely what the federal government is on about: fostering a sense of collective responsibility for regional development. It is interesting that some fairly well-known Nationals who have had great aspirations for recovering the federal division of Calare since 1983, when it was lost by the National Party, have been wandering around with local media releases suggesting that this government has somehow forgotten them in terms of regional development. Very powerful statements from clearly non-politically based organisations like the Central West Economic Development Group, which does represent those councils, give some sort of credence to the fact that this government does acknowledge that there is a great deal in this budget for regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen in many other parts of Australia, until now many communities have been unwilling or, indeed, unable to put aside some of their parochial jealousies, their vested interests and their cynicism in a way that would enable them to unite as a region and to pursue genuine regional development initiatives. If my own region is anything to go by, and I think it is, then the government's actions in Working Nation and the budget papers have been just the catalyst that was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who are privileged to represent rural and regional Australia all know that there is tremendous potential in regions right throughout Australia. The problem until now, though, has been how to unlock that enormous potential that does exist. The government's national regional development strategy recognises that regions are best placed to take the lead in shaping their own future. It is not a case of a government imposing some sort of tops-down approach to regional development. We do not have a magic formula in this place for telling the various regions, which are very different in their composition throughout Australia, what is best for them. That would be insulting the collective intelligence and the collective strength of those regions. This approach is recognised as very much a bottom-up approach, but we will be providing the necessary seed money and, indeed, infrastructure support money to allow that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The approach recognises that the Commonwealth will not mandate some sort of uniform solution. We are prepared to work in partnership with the states, the territory governments and, importantly, with local government and local communities to make the best use of all those available resources and opportunities. There will always be, of course, some sort of cargo cult mentality when it comes to regional development. The prime supporters, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as I am sure you are only too well aware in your own electorate, are the agrarian socialists&mdash;the National Party&mdash;who always see things in terms of a central government providing a quick-fix solution to some sort of perceived problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Predictably, many of these people, one of them being the New South Wales Minister for Small Business and Regional Development, Mr Chappell, have come out and accused the federal government of not throwing enough money in the recent budget at regional development. He can be excused for having party political reasons for making such claims, but others have no excuse other than they have missed the whole point of the government's regional development strategy. Fortunately, there are people out there like Alex Ferguson from the Central West Economic Development Group who have already recognised that the days of cargo cultism are well and truly over. He publicly stated last week that the regional development initiatives contained in the budget:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . heralded a new era whereby the Federal Government would no longer be the `Mr Fixit' for regional economies. The White Paper does, however, provide us with the tools to take control of our own region.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the bottom-up approach that I am talking about that is well supported by organisations like the Central West Economic Development Group, which has already undertaken very detailed ABS based research into the potential of the central west New South Wales region. The strategy that is outcome driven is in the process of preparation. Clearly, in many ways central west New South Wales is already ahead of many regions, and because of this I believe it is ideally placed to almost immediately, once the paperwork is ready to roll, tap into many of the initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity during my contribution to acknowledge the board of the Central West Economic Development Group, which consists of a range of people from business, unions, the Orange Agricultural College of the University of Sydney, as well as the six local government authorities, for placing this region in this very strong position. I certainly look forward to a continuation of this cooperative spirit as the central west regional development strategy is put into place over coming months. I am also looking forward to a continuation of the spirit of cooperation in a meeting I hope to organise shortly that will involve the Office of Regional Development, the Central West Economic Development Group, organisations like business enterprise centres and local councils so that we can further analyse and build upon the initiatives contained in the budget and the white paper. This meeting, I hope, will allow us to maximise further the region's potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further reason, though, why I am very pleased about the role of the Central West Economic Development Group in this process. That is, the group was in fact established during my tenure as Minister for Local Government through a very similar program called the local enterprise program. In 1992 the Office of Local Government provided some $300,000 over a three-year period towards the operation of regional bodies with similar organisations in a range of regions throughout Australia, including the Gosford-Wyong area of New South Wales, Ipswich in Queensland, and south-east Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the aims of the local enterprise program fitted very comfortably with notions of regional development being pursued in many of these initiatives. They were: to facilitate fully the development of the growth potential of those key regions, thereby contributing to the expansion of the national economy; to focus on those regional competitive advantages which lead to enterprises with rapid growth prospects and capacity for substantial wealth generation rather than self-employment initiatives and small business with only some sort of a local domain; and to draw together the appropriate elements, individuals and, if necessary, regions to create the critical mass that is often necessary for effective national and international market entry and maintenance in the traded goods and services section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In acknowledging the role of the government this time in pursuing notions of regional development, my former responsibility&mdash;the Office of Local Government&mdash;certainly played a very landmark role in driving this process. I am sure that many of those former officers will feel very distinctly pleased with the overall directions of the response to regional development contained in the white paper, Working Nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the House for the opportunity to make some of those comments on the regional development aspects of the budget, certainly as they apply to my electorate. I believe it does represent a unique and wonderful opportunity for regions to do something very constructive as we now enter a very exciting period in the 1990s&mdash;a period of low inflation and growing employment prospects for many of those areas that have been affected by economic difficulties over the last few years. In the context of the 1994-95 budget, I believe that those regions are well placed to do well into the 1990s. </PARA>

The Labor Party cares about social justice as much as a grasshopper cares about its mate.

To suggest that those who vote for Labor are the true believers is a nonsense. This party betrayed and corrupted their very values years ago.

Are those opposite honestly saying that we Australians on this side of parliament do not care or even feel any responsibility for those Australians who are disadvantaged? Is anyone on the other side of the parliament brave enough to walk from this place and identify those of us on this side whom he or she thinks do not care about the disadvantaged in Australia?

The Prime Minister promised in 1992 to return the impact of inflation back to the taxpayer. Yet a whopping 8.1 per cent more income tax will be collected this year compared to last year. When is this Prime Minister ever going to keep a promise he makes to the Australian people? How long will it be before the Australian people&mdash;who generally hate scoundrels and laggards&mdash;give this Prime Minister the real short shrift? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the Prime Minister's promise about the tax cuts, the l-a-w, law? They are gone. Remember the gang buster investment waiting promise? That has gone. Remember those growth forecast promises? Within two weeks, they are gone, according to Access Economics. Remember the low interest rates promise? That is potentially gone, according to recent press reports from the Prime Minister and the Reserve Bank governor. Remember the Qantas sale promise? It has been made twice so far. That has gone. Remember our debt reduction program promise, `We are going to reduce the debt?' That is gone because the budget actually increases debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government debt will almost triple from $33 billion in 1991. That might surprise some in the gallery. Our debt was $33 billion in 1991; it will increase to $95 billion only three years later in 1995. Remember the Prime Minister's promises? He said there would be more and better jobs. That promise has gone. He said there would be no new taxes. That has gone. He said there will be lower government debt. That has gone. There is no gain in this budget, just continued pain. Recent newspaper reports would indicate that about business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should have been done in this budget? What should it have provided for? First, there should have been an effort to reform the complete tax system, which discriminates against those Australians who are struggling at the moment. We tax those living under the poverty line. Secondly, we need policies that promote business growth, not hamper it with the current tremendous cost disadvantages of doing business in Australia. Thirdly, there should be a national savings strategy to reboost our national savings and reduce this growing debt crisis. The government should have looked at the way it does business and start to reduce the trappings it has got used to over the last 11 years and begin to become more responsible to the taxpayers of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is a real dud. It is a dud because those opposite who get up and support it only speak in rhetoric. Although many of those opposite are people of truly high principle and would not wish to harm the Australian public, they have begun to believe their own rhetoric. I ask those opposite to look around and see what is happening in their own electorates and to demand more responsibility from the executive of their own party. Stand against those who would hold this great country back, and fight for responsibility of government. Say no to homelessness. Say no to unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to all Australians, `You pay the taxes. It is time to demand greater responsibility from your government. Demand lower debt, demand more savings and demand a more flexible business system.' It is time that these values came back into our parliamentary system and it is time for Australians to demand more from their parliamentary representatives. Instead of having people walk into this place, stand up and deliver rhetoric, let us get some responsibility back into government and start paying our way rather than borrowing our way. Talk is cheap, and this budget has sold Australia short. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">It is a real delight to speak in this debate because the budget is a well targeted one. It concentrated on stimulating growth of employment and on increasing training opportunities and work experience opportunities for the long-term unemployed. It is an equitable budget and it will stimulate the level of economic activity in the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), was asserting that there is a debt problem in Australia. He clearly does not know the situation. The Australian public sector&mdash;Commonwealth, state and local government put together&mdash;has less debt as a proportion of GDP than any other Western country. Our debts are lower than those of any other comparable country in the world. To assert that we have a debt problem is simply ill-informed. I am astonished that the honourable member opposite does not know that. I would urge him to look up the latest OECD <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> to see the figures for himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to go on and talk about additional things that can be done about the unemployment problem. Quite clearly, it is Australia's most serious problem. It is clearly a problem to which there are no panaceas but to which a whole series of additional public policies and changes in business approaches, union practice and community attitudes are necessary. It is essential&mdash;and, in saying this, I think I would concur with the honourable member who spoke before me&mdash;for us to give additional attention to this problem. None of us can claim to have the whole answer to it, and we must go on exploring possibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential reason for that is that there is a massive cost in both economic and human terms to unemployment, and we want to minimise that now and in the future and as quickly as we possibly can. The principal requirement is that there be a rigorous implementation of the goal of full employment. The government accepts the goal of full employment; it has reiterated that during the election, in the speech of the Governor-General and again in the green and white papers. The question is: how do we achieve that? There are a whole series of changes in policies still that seem to be very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important changes is that we must be more sceptical of the extremist and dogmatic ideology, called economic rationalism by some people and, more accurately I think, economic fundamentalism which dominated a lot of public debate and the minds of many of the senior advisers to government during the 1980s. The influence of that ideology peaked at the end of the 1980s. But there are still many officials holding senior positions in the Commonwealth Public Service who are committed to it and who need to re-examine, in quite practical terms, the impact of the policies they have been recommending and what policy changes are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A return from that fundamentalist detour will involve a more reasonable approach to economic policy, based on the commitment to full employment, equity, economic growth and environmental sustainability. But, as well, it will involve a careful analysis of the way the economy and society operate rather than how neo-classical theory or fundamentalist ideological hypotheses suggest they do and practical means for achieving those goals in the least costly ways. Of course, when we start to do that, there will be no shortage of jobs needing to be done&mdash;none at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task is to match the needs with the available people. For example, standards of primary, secondary and tertiary education and health care are being undermined by funding cuts; retrenchment of teachers and closures of hospital beds are increasing unemployment. We saw evidence of that in South Australia's financial statement yesterday. Last year about 150,000 applicants to technical and further education colleges all around Australia were unable to obtain places. To provide those places would increase employment of staff and the number of youth in training and so substantially reduce youth unemployment, as well as increasing the skills of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Services for the vulnerable&mdash;including the unemployed; the aged; the intellectually and psychologically disabled; families in conflict, including survivors of domestic violence; recent migrants from non-English speaking backgrounds; and Aborigines&mdash;are all inadequate and many have worsened relative to need during the long period of expenditure cutting. High unemployment intensifies demand for supportive human services, such as health, housing and emergency counselling. Yet cuts have continued in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that most of the services are being delivered by the states and territories, the Commonwealth has reduced their net funding from 9 1/2 per cent of national income 20 years ago to 4.9 per cent now, nearly halving the proportion of funds available to the states. During the last decade funding for scientific and cultural organisations, such as CSIRO and the ABC, on which the vitality of the economy and society depend, have been reduced by a third as a proportion of national income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main areas of employment growth during the next decade will be in the services sector. On the one hand, two-thirds of all people in the work force are already employed in the service industries: community services; wholesaling and retailing; professional, technical and other personal services; transport and communication; finance, property and business services; and recreation and, on the other, for many years the proportion of employment in agriculture, mining and manufacturing has been declining, and that trend is likely to continue. Those trends are a universal feature of developed countries. We must recognise the fact that they will continue in Australia and that, if they are not allowed to continue, we will be depriving ourselves of employment growth where it can most naturally occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that is inevitable is that human services are highly labour intensive and are the least affected by technological change; they are far less affected by technological change than industries producing physical goods. The demand for human services rises with income and so increases as a proportion of total demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Macro-economic policy for the rest of the 1990s must be framed so as to achieve the highest rate of growth of output and so of employment which is both feasible and ecologically sustainable. That is the government's commitment. A major component of this must be improvements in the availability, accessibility and quality of human services. Rather than setting education and health standards based on the poorest quality in any state, Australia should at least aim to level up to the highest standard achieved in any part of the country and, whenever possible, to move beyond this and seek excellence. We all want excellence in every area of public life; we must seek it as well in the provision of human services. This would involve a major expansion of employment in publicly funded community services, whether provided by governments, non-profit community organisations&mdash;including churches and other voluntary groups&mdash;or privately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education and health are large sectors where increased employment would obviously be justified as it would be in services for families, the aged, the unemployed, the disabled and migrants. That is also true of services for Aborigines&mdash;and I was appalled by the previous speaker's comments about government support for social justice to Aborigines. Increased employment in research, development and demonstration and in legal, scientific and management advisory and marketing support would contribute to improving business prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community interest in the arts has been growing rapidly, as would be expected when average income is growing. Public funding should also increase in response and so boost growth of employment in the cultural sector. There is considerable scope for growth of employment in the cultural sector, as the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), at the table, is well aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These improvements and other parts of the strategy being described would lead to a permanent growth in the demand for labour. But another part of the expansion for labour comprises exactly the kinds of programs that were announced in the white paper; that is, those which increase the employment opportunities for the long-term unemployed&mdash;the people who have lost contact with the work force, whose skills have been undermined by a period of unemployment and who need additional help in getting back into work experience and additional training opportunities. That white paper program is perfectly well targeted to achieve those results. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. The response to the white paper and the budget shows there is overwhelming community support for those policies. Another area, though, where additional initiative is required is public infrastructure. During the last couple of decades there has been a substantial fall in the level of public investment. Allowing that to happen not only deprives ourselves of the increase in efficiency which can flow from improvements in the public infrastructure but also undermines the stimulus to private investment which public investment can provide. Public investment increases private sector efficiency and productivity and, therefore, stimulates growth of business investment. We should be aiming to build up public investment and private investment through those mechanisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of proposals should be partly funded through revenue growth as economic growth occurs and through other equitable and progressive changes to the tax system. As Australia is the lowest taxed developed country, we do have scope for deciding that we want to live in a decent civilised society and taking the necessary steps to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another dimension of a strategy to maximise growth of employment must be the continuation of the accord and income restraint. We could see during the 1980s the enormous benefit that wage restraint caused in the growth of employment and reduction of inflation. We need to continue those strategies during the 1990s. But, to make that morally tenable, we must ensure that higher incomes are also restrained. The explosion of executive incomes undermines the willingness of others on lower incomes to accept restraint. Yet both are essential if we are going to maximise growth of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these measures would directly or indirectly stimulate activity in the private sector, but two additional policies are of crucial importance. Firstly, it is essential to keep interest rates as low as possible. It has been very good to hear the commitment of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in recent days to that goal under very silly questioning from the opposition. Although investment responds principally to the level of expected sales, interest rates influence the cost of investment and are, as well, a powerful determinant of the exchange rate and of consumer demand. So interest rate minimisation is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, one more innovative proposal which ought to be seriously considered, and which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which I chair, is presently looking at, is the possibility of reducing or abolishing payroll tax because that would remove a perverse tax on employment and reduce labour costs. Of course, that is a very complex proposal because that is a state tax and at present generates about $6 billion of revenue. But it could be offset by the introduction of a greenhouse gas emission tax. The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) has recently spoken about the possibility of changing the tax structure so as to provide incentives for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This would be a very feasible trade-off to examine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keeping interest rates down also avoids attracting short-term overseas capital unnecessarily and so avoids unwanted upward pressure on the exchange rate. Australia's international competitiveness has dramatically improved&mdash;by 30 per cent in fact&mdash;over the last few years with lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate, but we must maintain those conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects of a comprehensive additional employment strategy, but I have had time only to concentrate on the ones I have mentioned. I will also mention that the environment industry offers many opportunities for growth of employment. It is also important that we examine the possibility of reducing average working hours. Many people in the community recognise it as perverse that during the last decade there has been a growth in the average working hours for full-time labour at exactly the time when it ought to be falling. The examination of feasible ways of achieving lower average working hours is one way of sharing the available work more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strategy such as that, in addition to those which are already in place, would maximise growth of employment. Economic growth alone will not be sufficient to achieve full employment. It would be very fortunate if we got down to five per cent, although that is the goal that the government is aiming for by the end of the decade. We should be aiming not only to rely on economic growth but also to find additional policies which would contribute to growth of employment. Each of those that I have mentioned should either be introduced or be seriously considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever there was a time for courage, honesty, leadership, strength, the necessary decisions and putting Australia first, it was in the 1994-95 budget. Regrettably, it lacked any of these characteristics. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) in his first budget, in two words, wimped out. We are now in the 11th year of a Labor government. On every occasion the Labor Party has had the opportunity to do some good it has put itself and its party ahead of the interests of Australia and the Australian people and gambled our future for its own electoral good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time the Labor government showed leadership. For 11 years people have been crying out for it, but in return they have received only lies, rhetoric, hollow promises and vitriolic abuse. They have never received decent leadership. Last year's budget was simply confirmation that the Labor Party was elected with no policies, having lied its way into office, and with no idea of how to address the fundamental problems facing our nation. It betrayed the Australian people. It let the Australian people down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot continue kidding ourselves or the people we were elected to represent. We need to honestly address the problems facing our nation. While the Treasurer had the perfect opportunity to do this, like all Labor Treasurers before him, he piked out and delivered a budget which will do nothing to address our problems. He has mortgaged the future of young Australians for his party's selfish political goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will direct my attention to a number of areas of the budget, but I think one of the most crippling, telling blows in this budget is directed towards young Australians. This group of people has been the worst affected over the last decade by the incompetence and mismanagement of the Labor government. Look at what has happened to young Australians under this Labor government. They are going to inherit a massive debt which this government has done very little to address. Indeed, not only will they inherit a mammoth debt but also many young Australians will inherit a lower standard of living than we enjoyed. They are faced with massive unemployment. Nearly one in every three young Australians is faced with unemployment on leaving school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many university graduates are also facing unemployment upon leaving&mdash;something that our age group never contemplated, whether we were leaving school or university. There was always a range of jobs available for us to go to. There is also the issue of youth homelessness. The Burdekin report suggests that there are at least 20,000 to 25,000 homeless young Australians, and that figure could possibly be as high as 70,000. There is also the issue of youth suicide. We are faced with the chilling reminder that Australia has the highest youth suicide rate in the industrialised world, which I will elaborate on later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sad statistics of a decade of Labor government. It has, at a time of need, abandoned these young Australians when they are calling out for solutions. What is more, young ethnic and Aboriginal Australians are hit harder when it comes to unemployment, and the government simply does not care. We should be providing young Australians a future that they can look forward to. But, instead, this government has mortgaged their future and expects them to pay for it. I would like to know how. Neither this budget nor the employment white paper will provide any sustained and significant employment opportunities for young Australians. The financial and social consequences will be felt for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such social consequence is suicide. The rate of youth suicide in Australia is the highest in the industrialised world. For 15- to 24-year-olds, 16.4 suicides occur per 100,000 people. Research shows that, for every suicide, there are between 20 to 100 attempts. In fact, more young people in our country die by their own hand than in a motor vehicle. Yet, ironically, more attention is paid to motor accident deaths than suicide, even though fewer young people die by the car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">British Medical Journal</EMPHASIS> quoted a historical study from 1907 to 1990 at the University of Sydney which showed that more than two-thirds of the changes in suicide rates in young men aged from their low to mid-20s are related to unemployment. Obviously unemployment itself is not the only cause, but the fact that unemployment causes low self-esteem, with people having nothing to do, crime, drug taking and other anti-social behaviour means that it is a prime cause of many problems that our society tragically has to face. This is an issue of major concern which the government must urgently address. I acknowledge the increase in funding to the national mental health strategy. Vitally important funding is directed to this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do know that Lifeline made a submission to the National Health and Medical Research Council seeking funding for the organisation to work on a suicide prevention strategy. It is groups like this, and the Samaritan Befrienders in Perth, which are important to our community for the care they provide to those who are most in need. I therefore implore the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to direct more attention to this important issue and to listen sympathetically to these community groups who are actively working towards suicide prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally on this topic, I must record my absolute dismay at the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to this issue. I was sitting in this place listening to the address in reply of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) when he said that `we have the highest rate of youth suicide in the Western world'. I distinctly recall the Prime Minister sitting across here laughing, to which the honourable member for Wentworth asked whether he was proud of such a fact. I think the laugh probably said it all. I think it is regrettable that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> did not record the Prime Minister laughing at the fact that we have the highest youth suicide in the Western world, for it would have shown the Prime Minister's true colours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Prime Minister often, when overseas, puts Australia down and criticises various aspects of our great nation, but for him in our institution of democracy to laugh at the fact that we have the highest youth suicide rate in the world is downright sick. Members opposite should hang their heads in shame for having as their leader a man who denigrates our nation and laughs at these very sad and telling statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further evidence that the Prime Minister cares little for Australia's youth is the fact that there is no minister for youth. They are an important national asset, yet the Prime Minister continues to neglect these young Australians. Last year the Australian Youth Foundation brought out a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A lost generation</EMPHASIS>. The report canvasses a vast range of issues of great importance to young Australians. It is a report worthy of a government response, yet nothing has been done about it, in spite of the fact that it has identified many issues the government should be addressing but has yet to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that I recently addressed questions to the Prime Minister asking why he has not appointed a minister for youth. I must say his answer was very disappointing. He said that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) is responsible for youth affairs, but obviously youth affairs are not important enough, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, to be given a portfolio. The interesting part is that the Prime Minister said it is not necessary to appoint a separate minister for youth because that responsibility goes across a number of portfolios. Why then does he have a minister assisting him on the status of women, when that portfolio also crosses a number of other portfolios, including health, ethnic affairs, social security, industrial relations and so on? The least he could do is give young Australians similar recognition and create a portfolio, if only one assisting him on the issue, for youth affairs. Any less will be to give a slap in the face to young Australians, as this government has consistently done to them for the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn my attention to our health system, which has many problems with it. The former shadow minister for health and family services, Senator Newman, put a lot of work into this area, and I was very saddened when for health reasons she announced her resignation from the shadow ministry. I would like to pay tribute to the hard work of Senator Newman and her staff, and I wish Jocelyn well for a speedy recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One issue I am concerned about is our growing hospital waiting lists. This is a problem that has existed for quite some time now, and it will continue to be a major problem for the government if it continues to try to appease the left wing of its party and ignore the commonsense and logical way to help solve the problem of our growing waiting lists. My office is often contacted by concerned people who are victims of our failing health system in that they, or one of their family, must wait to get into hospital for elective surgery. Presently there are 120,000 people awaiting surgery. They each have a problem which needs to be attended to, and more often than not they must wait a minimum of six months before they can have surgery. One lady who contacted my office had a cancerous lump growing in her throat, a gentleman required a hip replacement, while another required surgery on his kidney. All of these people are in a considerable amount of pain. They are not at all well yet, because of Labor's ideological hang-ups, they must wait great lengths of time before they can get into hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely those members opposite, even those such as the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who lack the commonsense to realise the problems with our health system should be sympathetic enough to show some compassion and put aside their own ideological beliefs and agree to some necessary changes to our health system to cut down on these appalling waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise that a sum of money was directed to Western Australia to fund more operations to cut the size of our waiting lists, but that will not fix the fundamental problem that still exists with the system. It is only a bandaid measure and, when we rip the bandaid off&mdash;that is, when the money runs out&mdash;there will still be a gaping hole that needs to be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), the Assistant Treasurer and many others in the government do not have private health insurance. Instead, they rely on Medicare, which each taxpayer must contribute to, so that many people earning far less than those opposite are contributing to the health insurance of those opposite who believe in an antiquated ideology. In essence, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health, the Assistant Treasurer and any others opposite who do not have private health insurance are sponging off overburdened taxpayers and systematically ruining our entire health system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicare was in principle a good idea. It was set up to ensure that there was some protection, in the form of health insurance, for lower income earners. It was introduced to ensure that those who could not afford private health insurance were protected from excessive medical bills. Unfortunately, those who could afford private health insurance decided to opt out of their private insurance and rely on Medicare. This meant that excessive demands were placed on the health system, with only limited funding; hence the waiting lists. If you look at the make-up of those waiting lists, you will notice they are the lower income earners, pensioners and social security recipients who cannot afford private health insurance. Indeed, the former Minister for Health, then Senator Richardson, said in a speech to the New South Wales ALP state conference last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the drop that is in private health insurance participation rates continues at any rate like it has been, over the next few years, it won't be long until there will be enormous pressure on the public system . . . We've got to look seriously at how to get the numbers in private health cover up.</PARA>
<PARA>The then minister followed that up a month later by saying that people dropping out of health insurance `push the battlers to the end of the queue'. The former Minister for Health has admitted that change is necessary. It is now time for his rhetoric to be matched with action from the government. If the Prime Minister falls ill, he can afford to go into a private hospital and pay for himself, if the wait is going to be too long. But he should be privately insured and not reliant on Medicare, given the fact that Medicare was set up to look after the lower income earners. </PARA>

If we took pressure off Medicare by providing incentives for private health insurance, a major burden would be lifted off the public health system, and that would ensure that those waiting to get into hospital do not have to wait as long, if at all. If the government continues down the road of no incentives, we will only see a higher Medicare levy, higher health insurance premiums and yet even longer hospital waiting lists.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to speak on the issue of breast cancer, which has been quite topical. Many residents in the electorate of Stirling signed petitions calling for greater funding for research into this awful disease. Just as important, of course, is the need for screening and so on. There is no doubt that the major media attention which shed light on this issue is a primary reason for this increase in funding. Therefore, it is also worth congratulating some individuals from this place for their bipartisan efforts in pressuring the government into increasing funding to this. I refer to the honourable members for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), Pearce (Mrs Moylan), Adelaide (Ms Worth), Indi (Mr Lieberman), Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), Capricornia (Ms Henzell), Forde (Ms Crawford) and Macquarie (Ms Deahm). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the Prime Minister gave all the credit for this funding increase to his wife, and I think that is a great slap in the face from the Prime Minister for four of his own backbenchers. I recall watching the debate on a motion from the honourable member for Cowan, and the thrust of the debate had unanimous support. It was the efforts of these eight members in particular which was a contributing factor to the increase in funding, and I think it is wrong of the Prime Minister to misdirect the praise from these members to his wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by commenting on the budget in its totality. I think it is farcical for the government to say it has kept its promise of not increasing taxes, when we have the tax increases announced last year still to come in, coupled with the increase in revenue from present taxes. In particular, there is an 8.1 per cent increase in PAYE tax and a seven per cent increase in company tax&mdash;which, together, add $4.5 billion to the government coffers&mdash;and then a whopping 131 per cent increase in fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget continues in the tradition of past Labor budgets, in that it continues the deception and the dishonesty and it squanders some perfect opportunities to act like a real government and make some necessary hard decisions. Many in the media have said it was a boring budget and an election budget&mdash;which really means a decisionless budget&mdash;a budget which should have offered hope and held out a hand to those who have been left out in the cold by Labor for the last decade. Instead, it just kicked them in the guts a little harder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has given up on the Australian people. It has decided it is unable to make proper decisions and, as a consequence, the Australian people must wait for a Downer government before they will get real leadership, correct and proper decisions, and no more squandered opportunities. I look forward to being part of a government which reunites our great nation and redelivers the opportunities that have been lost under this directionless and disgraceful Labor rabble. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contribution of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron), like that of most of those on the other side, was made entirely without reference to the state of the economy. On a day like today, with the release of the national accounts, I would like to start by making some points about economic growth and by describing what the current state of the economy is. These points are worth putting on the record, if only for the edification of honourable members opposite. Let us see where some of our current economic settings are and how they are conducive to continued strong economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inflation remains at its lowest level for three decades. It is less than that of our major trading partners. Inflationary expectations are low. Interest rates are at their lowest level since the 1970s. Business confidence is high. In the manufacturing industry, business confidence is at its highest level for 30 years. Consumer confidence is at its highest level for 10 years and is at near record levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity is increasing markedly and has increased over a period of time. Real unit labour costs have declined over the last decade. Profit share is at a near all-time high. Our international competitiveness continues to improve; it is now 30 per cent greater than it was a decade ago. Time lost in industrial disputes in 1993 was the lowest for 30 years. Our economic growth over the course of 1993 was four per cent, which is far better than in most other relevant industrial countries, which on average grew by about one per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the economic conditions which obtain at present and which are relevant in very many respects to the most important aspect of the economy, which is growth. One aspect which is obviously very important to growth in the economy is the presence of incentives to invest in the Australian economy. It is important to list some of those measures which, in addition to the general economic parameters, currently exist as incentives for business to invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the last couple of years, the government has put in place a series of major incentives for investment which, over the course of the financial year 1994-95, will effectively provide $3 billion worth of incentives for business to invest. Some of those measures are the accelerated depreciation rates which were included in the One Nation statement, the development allowance for large projects and the more general investment allowance, the 150 per cent research and development expenditure write-off and the cut in company tax rates from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. I note in passing that at the last election those opposite wanted to increase company tax rates from 39 per cent to 45 per cent and include a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Working Nation and budget statements mention improvements made to the pooled development funds arrangements and also to the infrastructure bonds as incentives for investment. These are significant economic conditions and significant incentives for investment. I also make some comments in respect of the budget forecasts of our economic prospects. I refer to the budget speech of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our immediate prospects are for even faster growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Real GDP is forecast to grow by 4 1/2 per cent in 1994-95, compared to 4 per cent in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment is expected to increase by 3 per cent, or almost another quarter of a million jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to around 9 1/2 per cent by June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index is forecast to remain low next year at 2 1/4 per cent, or about the level of our major trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA>With the release of the national accounts today we can see that those forecasts are certainly being met, if not exceeded. The percentage change of GDP from the March quarter 1993 to the March quarter 1994, in seasonally adjusted terms, is five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend estimates are worth commenting on. The trend estimate of gross domestic product increased by 1.2 per cent in the quarter to March 1994. The trend estimate of gross domestic product, average series, has increased by 4.3 per cent since the March quarter 1993. The trend estimate of all three independent measures&mdash;income based, expenditure based and product based&mdash;has grown in each of the last 10 quarters. The trend in gross domestic product as it is averaged, per capita, has increased in each of the last 10 quarters, after declining for the previous two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the national accounts, I refer to an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which is headed `Small business shrugs aside economic woes to generate jobs'. It is a report by Nicholas Read on the latest yellow pages small business index which makes the point that the small business sector is still surging ahead as a source of job creation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, a quarterly survey of 1,000 small businesses nationwide, said the sector had employment growth of 2.1 per cent in the last quarter and 3.1 per cent in the past six months, half of the total rise in employment recorded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to make the point that my own state of Western Australia had:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . led the nation in small business employment growth during the last two quarters, with 19 per cent of the State's small business proprietors increasing their numbers of employees in the most recent quarter.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to make the point that following Western Australia in that area of growth is the state of Queensland. I refer also to the first paragraph of Budget Paper No. 1 to make some points about the budget deficit and the Working Nation statement. The first paragraph of the budget paper says as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget deficit for 1994-95 is estimated at $11.7 billion, some $1.9 billion below the outcome now expected in 1993-94, notwithstanding the substantial measures announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> to deal with the Government's foremost priority, unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>What that refers to, of course, is the government's continuing commitment to ensure that we return to a low deficit and meet our commitment of a deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. That in a sense completes the circle of those economic parameters which the government is committed to: low deficit, low inflation, high growth, high productivity and high wages. At the same time, through the Working Nation package, we meet our commitment to what I regard as our most pressing social and economic problem, which is Australia's long-term unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as honourable members opposite are concerned, their solution to the long-term unemployed was to throw them off the dole after nine months, to slash $800 million from outlays directed towards the unemployed, and to slash wages. This is the policy to which those opposite were committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the House's attention to some of the key aspects of the Working Nation white paper which mark a stark contrast between the approach of those opposite and the approach of honourable members on this side. There are real incentives for business in the Working Nation package, including increased access to capital for business, particularly small business; the suspension of the training guarantee levy; a training wage for juniors and adults; reform of the CES and private competition for the CES; a more effective government purchasing policy; and increased access to research and development tax concessions so small business can develop good ideas. Those measures are, of course, designed to maximise growth and are in addition to the job compact, which is intended to break the cycle of long-term unemployment by providing work experience and training for the long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compact will provide a guaranteed place for every person who has been unemployed for over 18 months through the provision of the training wage, private sector job subsidies, new self-employment opportunities, public sector work experience and training schemes, new work opportunities in the community sector and, finally, help for all unemployed young people in obtaining training and job placement immediately after leaving school. That is the array of methods which those on this side of the House are committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the change of leadership of honourable members opposite, we on our side are entitled to ask whether those policies to which the opposition was committed at the last election are constant today. I refer to them again: tipping people off unemployment benefits after nine months, slashing $800 million from outlays directed towards unemployed people and slashing wages through the opposition's so-called training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of points to make about the leadership changes opposite. Firstly, the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) were, of course, handcuffed to the Fightback package; they committed themselves entirely to it. It is worth drawing the attention of honourable members opposite to some of the comments made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling, in respect of the new Liberal leadership team. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS> of 19 May, an article which bears the honourable member's photograph states that a Liberal backbencher from Western Australia described the new Liberal leader as a `fuddy-duddy'. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Monday, 20 May, the honourable member for Stirling is quoted as saying that he is opposed to the ascension of the new Leader of the Opposition because `no-one in Western Australia knows him.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that we have the new Leader of the Opposition and the new Deputy Leader of the Opposition trying to pretend that they are policy sheep in wolves' clothing, it is worth drawing attention to some of the comments that have been made about the new Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 23 May, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Costello was devastated when he convincingly lost the deputy leadership after the election to moderate fellow-Victorian Michael Wooldridge. To this day, he finds the result impossible to comprehend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the result is a combination of adverse reaction to his style, and deep fears about his right-wing views and hard-Right party connections . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His deeply conservative social beliefs and let-the-market-go-for-it economic views have also made it more difficult for Costello, than Downer, to soften his image amid the party's return to the centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . many Liberals found Costello's rhetoric frightening and reactionary.</PARA>
<PARA>So, despite the effort of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to pretend that the policy has changed, here we find the real wolf in the sheep's clothing. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 April 1994, in an article on the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, refers to his unsuccessful attempt to wrest the deputy leadership on a previous occasion, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When he said, during his campaign for the deputy leadership after the last election, that he had always had a strong interest in social issues, one Opposition frontbencher quipped that "saying Peter Costello had an interest in social issues is like saying Dracula is a vegetarian".</PARA>
<PARA>So it is quite clear to those on this side that the hardline policies continue to range supreme. I was very interested to see reference to the Victorian Premier describing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as `dog'. I assume that, rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing, we are now entitled to refer to him as a rabid policy dog in sheep's clothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw the attention of honourable members to some of the other changes in personnel that have occurred on the other side of the House. We on this side awaited with great expectation the arrival of the former Senator Bishop in this House as the honourable member for Mackellar. We have seen her performances in recent days, and they have been the subject of some comments which are worth drawing to the House's attention. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> today, in an article entitled `Bishop's speech puts a chill in the House', Geoff Kitney says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two months after making the move which could have propelled her into the Liberal Party leadership, Mrs Bronwyn Bishop has made her maiden speech to the House of Representatives amid concerns that she may have difficulty holding on to a senior position on the Opposition frontbench.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Liberal MPs expressed disappointment last night, contrasting it unfavourably with the maiden speech of the new Liberal MP for Warringah, Mr Tony Abbott, which he made soon after Mrs Bishop's speech.</PARA>
<PARA>So the first speech of the honourable member for Mackellar to this House has gone down like a lead balloon. That endorses the view of the editorial of 1 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. Under the heading `Ms Bishop's poor performance', the editorial says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Parliament resumed this week, the shadow health minister, Ms Bronwyn Bishop, only deepened the existing doubts about her substance and performance as a politician.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can she be an asset rather than a liability for Mr Downer? It seems doubtful, judging by Monday's performance in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That also seems very doubtful, given the views of the electors when she fronted up to the poll in Mackellar. But I was intrigued to see that honourable members opposite preferred the contribution made by the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). I noted in his speech that the honourable member for Warringah referred to Mr Bob Santamaria as having `sparked my interest in politics'. Given that we now find the intellectual basis for some of the new entrants to the other side resting with Mr Santamaria, I thought it worthy to draw the House's attention to a contribution that Mr Santamaria made in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australia</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">n</EMPHASIS> of 18 and 19 May. Mr Santamaria, the philosophical parent of the honourable member for Warringah, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party is thrashing around in what may merely be another of the familiar leadership struggles, or alternatively, the party's "last hurrah". Those who think it is all a matter of John Hewson's leadership are mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far back as 1988 John Howard suggested the Liberals should go down the line of a family policy. Fully six years have passed. Nothing has happened.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changing leaders without essentially changing direction will get the Coalition nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA>On one occasion I had the good fortune to hear a longstanding member of the opposition, and a quite prominent member of the opposition, make the point that in the good old days of the Liberal Party, when the DLP was around, all that the Liberal Party candidates had to do was slip in their nominations and the work was done for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably for those opposite, times have changed. It is not enough simply for those opposite to put their nominations in and handcuff themselves to Fightback. It is time that they started to take the view, which we on this side of the House take, that Australia does have the capacity under our policies to become a high growth country, a high employment country, a low inflation country and a high wage country. These are the things to which we are committed; they are not the things to which those opposite are committed. Essentially what those opposite are committed to is the proposition that the solution to any economic ill is to slash the wages of those who work for a living. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am going to talk about the appropriation bill in relation to small business in Australia. In the third annual review on small business in Australia, the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development&mdash;the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths)&mdash;and the then Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, prefaced the report with the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A pressing goal for Australia in the 1990s is to ensure that we encourage and support a dynamic and successful small business sector, with an emphasis on export-oriented internationally competitive firms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last eighteen months witnessed important developments which clarified the economic significance of small business in Australia, and led to increased support for the sector's development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strategies to reduce unemployment must now take into account the contribution of small and medium enterprises to job creation, and further improvements to the business environment in which small and medium enterprises operate remain a priority.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly there are measures taken in this budget by the government which have been a welcome relief to some in the business community but, coming off such a low base, frankly any crumbs from the table would have been welcome. The government has simply tinkered at the fringes, lacking the courage to make real inroads into policies that will drive strong and resilient businesses and markets in Australia by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussing the budget implications for small and medium businesses we must link them to the white paper. Despite the government's rhetoric about the priority it argues must be given to small businesses, the reality is that the government did not give them any priority when it set up the task force to look at ways to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee consisted of bureaucrats and academics. I do not for one minute dispute their ability and their vast knowledge, but I would have thought that a government serious about finding jobs for 900,000 unemployed Australians would have taken note of its own rhetoric and included some prominent business people and organisations on that committee. It may have given some policy direction to reforms that will contribute to strong growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 227 pages that this government devoted to Working Nation, only 28 pages in a chapter called `Industry Development Policies' were directed at the small business sector. The fact is that apart from some measly crumbs, that document, the white paper, offers very little in terms of real hope for growth and expansion in the private sector. It has the potential to turn Australia into a nation of the best trained unemployed&mdash;a training nation rather than a working nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Monday during question time, in answer to a question from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), crowed about the increases in profit for Australian companies. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opposition will see that the level of profitability in Australia at the moment is well beyond the late 1980s experience, which itself had no historical precedent, . . . why would there be investment? . . . because profits have never been higher, principally, because there is demand in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister knows that profits do not necessarily equal investment. It may be correct to make the assessment that profitability is well beyond the late 1980s experience, to a point which has no historical precedent, but it came off an historically low base, and one would expect that from that low point any growth would look good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's claim that profit equals investment is refuted by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investment Monitor</EMPHASIS>, which shows that profit is not being ploughed back into development of business in Australia; it is going offshore. Overseas projects in which Australian companies have an interest have risen from $9.5 billion a year ago to $37 billion today. That is a huge amount of Australian profits going into overseas investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good foot stamping and scolding business for looking for the most attractive investment options. We have spent a decade lecturing business on efficiency and on the need to become internationally competitive. As I said earlier, the rhetoric is cosy but the reality is crass. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 16 May 1994, Ed Shann pointed out that, if unemployment is to be reduced to five per cent by the end of the decade, as the Treasurer has suggested, Australia needs to grow at four to five per cent a year until then. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be great news for the share market if this happened, but you do not grow rapidly just by wishing to do so . . . The budget assumes a rise in business investment of 14.5 per cent in 1994-95. But business investment needs to sustain annual growth of 10 per cent for each of the five following years if Australian output is to grow by an average of 4-5 per cent a year for the rest of the decade . . . In investment terms we need a miracle. In the past 25 years, Australian business investment has not achieved double-digit growth for two calendar years in a row. To sustain output growth of 4-5 per cent a year this decade, we need business investment to rise in double digits for six years in a row . . . Australia is still putting hurdles in the way of investment . . . Supply side reforms are the key . . . Australia has to keep reforming the labour market, improving the tax system, lifting the efficiency of transport and public enterprises and reducing bureaucratic red tape on project approvals.</PARA>
<PARA>Yesterday during question time the Treasurer went to great pains to explain all the measures in the budget that are helpful to business. When we analyse those measures, we see that they pay little more than lip-service to a sector of Australia that holds the key to improved prosperity for all Australians and the key to funding sound social policies for those unable, through no fault of their own, to participate as employers or employees. There is little in the white paper or the budget to encourage long-term growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that the small and medium business sectors are not asking for government handouts. Their main expectation is for a stable, reasonable policy that sustains a steady rate of growth, not the knee-jerk reaction approach to economic policy that sends interest rates skyrocketing to levels such as those experienced in 1989-90, driven largely by ill-conceived government policy, when interest rates lifted from 12 to 24 per cent within a very short space of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses which had geared up with big expenditure on capital equipment to meet the high demands for the two preceding years were caught short by a policy that increased costs to an unsustainable level and decreased demand. Unable to withstand the onslaught, a record number of Australian firms went into bankruptcy. Hundreds of decent men and women lost the businesses they had sunk their life's work and savings into but, more devastatingly, it too often meant the loss of the family home, along with all the ensuing social upheaval. The Prime Minister, whose policies as Treasurer paid scant regard to the needs of small and medium business, has the gall to scold the private sector for not investing enough and for not employing more Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, on the one hand, the government talks about efficiency in the business sector and internationally competitive industry, on the other hand, it seeks to increase its own housekeeping by over $1 billion in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) said yesterday in his speech to this bill, the government is selling the family silver to meet the champagne bills. And champagne bills they are, with Gould bird prints for the Prime Minister, a Thai teak table and a carport extension for the Lodge which cost more than most of us would pay for our homes, not to mention the squandering of taxpayers' money on the many mismanaged departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year alone there were audit reports that were critical in their assessment of programs such as the sports rorts, which cost the Australian people $60 million; credit card scandals, which went into millions of dollars; and the failure of the national energy management program. The list goes on ad nauseam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing the business communities want from the Prime Minister is a lecture on their responsibilities to be competitive and profitable and to solve the nation's unemployment problem by employing people they do not need and cannot pay for. The simple fact is that if we want more employees we need greater investment and/or more employers. The answer of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the problem of mismanagement of the nation's economy is to rip some more taxes off the people of Australia. The business sector cannot, with such ease, increase prices in an already price sensitive and competitive market. If it looks like making&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;a profit, the government sends the Prices Surveillance Authority to investigate its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against some of the small taxation concessions for business, the government's net gains will be much greater. With fringe benefits tax up by a massive 130.7 per cent, to $3,230 million in 1994-95, the government shows little real understanding of its own rhetoric about developing export oriented business. Some of my colleagues on the other side think that when developing export industries, people just fly off to another country with a bagful of samples tucked under their arm and sign up multimillion dollar export contracts over a cup of tea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fringe benefits tax has to be paid for food that the representative consumes in the course of a meal with clients and a detailed account must be kept, clearly separating the representative's consumption from that of the client. Of course, there are no tax benefits for the cost of the client's meal. I know that there have been some legitimate concerns about abuse with the free lunch syndrome, but any sensible government trying to help its business community develop export industries would recognise that the requirements for doing business in some countries involves these legitimate expenses and it would set sensible limits on tax deductibility for entertaining allowances as a business expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the budget expects to raise an additional $1 billion from improved compliance, which is a very handy euphemism for tax terrorism. On the cost of compliance with regulation, legislation, licensing and taxation, the government set up the Office of Regulation Review with a view to reviewing regulation at the Commonwealth level. The irony of this is that this Labor government, in 1991 alone, excelled itself by adding 6,905 pages of legislation to the statute books in 2,116 acts. This is almost as many pages of statute as the 7,544 pages passed in the 10 years from 1960 to 1969. Government regulation has cost the Australian economy dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is all the subordinate regulation passed to accompany the acts. Perhaps legislative activity rises as national prosperity declines. In any event, the government plans to expand this Office of Regulation Review. If it is anything like the Industry Commission, which is in the process of moving from Canberra to Melbourne, with a budget allocation of $5.7 million paid by the taxpayers for redundancy payments alone, then the small business community can be sure that it will not get value for money in the regulation area, or should I say in the supposed deregulation area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What small business needs from government is economic strength and stable, healthy economic policies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs industrial relations reform that works from a base of win-win, not the pretence of industrial relations reforms evident in the new legislation which passed up the chance to move out of the realm of the troglodyte and into the light, an opportunity sacrificed for self-indulgence and self-interest and cosy deal making between the government and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 25 May Alan Wood was talking about the problems that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is facing in reforming the industrial relations legislation and in facing the need for industrial relations provisions into the next decade or so. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Brereton's fundamental problem is that he has been cast in the role of defender of a system of industrial relations that is doomed by the inexorable march of economic forces beyond his control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If he has been inclined to doubt that, he should do so no longer. One of the last bastions of the old system has finally fallen to the realities of global economics in the 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The surrender came in an extraordinary speech that has been given nothing like the attention it deserves, presumably because it was delivered on Budget night, May 10, when the eyes of the nation were elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speech was the second annual Kingsley Laffer Memorial Lecture, delivered by the chief executive of the MTIA, Bert Evans. In it, Evans finally and irrevocably abandoned the centralised industrial relations system he and the MTIA have been leading defenders of and key players in, for nearly half a century.</PARA>
<PARA>The other things that this country desperately needs if it is to get its small business or medium business sector going is infrastructure development. We have seen a run-down in our programs to maintain, repair and develop a road system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other infrastructure developments need to take place. There are micro-economic reforms that have been talked about since the Prime Minister was the Treasurer and set into train the deregulation of the financial markets, the floating of the Australian dollar and made the point that we badly needed to follow that with micro-economic reforms. Again, we have seen a lot of rhetoric but very little substance in terms of real policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this budget sets up more bureaucratic red tape and more or expanded existing government agencies; it slams higher taxes on business and offers an economic policy that is destined to increase the cost to business overall. It is not all bad news, as many agencies have worked effectively to assist the small business sector, but for the Treasurer to claim that the budget provides benefits such as the $0.4 million over two years to improve Australia's 800,000 business's access to training schemes&mdash;which, by the way, amounts to $4 per annum per company or per firm in Australia&mdash;is stretching it a bit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we are discussing the appropriation, what we are talking about is our priorities as a nation. The appropriations and the white paper this year set the scene for growth, for jobs, for higher living standards, and for a better distribution of wealth in our community. In short, we have the best conjunction of economic circumstances in 30 years. We have high profit share, high rates of growth, low inflation and low interest rates; but, despite all of this, there remains a steady diet of pessimism, particularly from the opposition. It is a pessimism, I might add, that is not shared by the business community that the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) was talking about before. In terms of reaction to the budget and the white paper from business, C.J. Stewart of the Australian Hotels Association said that the white paper initiatives `particularly provide for business to produce the jobs rather than solely depending on artificial government schemes'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said about the budget that `this is a very different approach from the past which will do much to build business confidence'. The Australian Mining Industry Council said, `Thumbs up for the budget.' Bert Evans from the MTIA, mentioned before, has had this to say about the white paper initiatives:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a constructive contribution to public policy, one which provides new directions to industry policy while genuinely attempting to address unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, the Business Council of Australia has said variously that the white paper is a `positive initiative towards addressing the problem' and `an important breakthrough to introduce a training wage for adults, particularly when this can be combined with a subsidy for those unemployed for longer periods'. The Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales said that `the job compact will ensure that a person's need to find a job will merge sweetly with an employer's need to fill one'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I talk about these optimistic assessments is that we get this constant diet of pessimism from the opposition. I think the opposition is in danger of being too pessimistic, and this may have unfortunate consequences in the community. We are in danger in our community, if we are too pessimistic, of passing this on to our children. It is a fact that Australians are great knockers, and this does enable us to keep a realistic perspective; but, if we are too pessimistic about our future and we constantly feed this back to our children, then our pessimism could well become a self-fulfilling prophecy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One gets a sense of this when one listens to the opposition in this House, and in particular to opposition reaction to the extraordinary national accounts which have come out today, which give us a 5 per cent growth rate. The opposition simply cannot believe it, and wants to talk it down. It becomes too easy to believe that the future holds bleak employment prospects, or that the world has become a more polluted and violent place, and so on. The fact of the matter is that our prospects now are infinitely brighter than they have ever been. They are infinitely brighter than they were at the height of the Cold War. They are infinitely brighter than they were at the height of the Vietnam War and at many other controversial periods in our history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that our kids and our community need to hear more than the pessimism from the opposition which is constantly telling them that they are going to inherit a world of very dark and bleak prospects. What we need to talk more about is the things that make this country a lucky country, the things that will allow this country to continue to grow and prosper. This is a matter which has been referred to recently by Hugh Mackay, in a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Middle Years</EMPHASIS>, where he warned of the danger of the kinds of downbeat assessments that are coming from the opposition, and of the consequences of those downbeat assessments being passed on to the next generation. </PARA>

That is what this diet of pessimism from the opposition can produce. It can well become a self-fulfilling prophecy, if the opposition does not honestly tell the people of this country the good with the bad, as they see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, this question has been recently addressed by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane. In a recent speech which should be compulsory reading for every member of the opposition, he spoke about the need to counter the sense of pessimism that some are peddling about Australia's future, because that sense of pessimism fails to recognise some of the very important factors that are running in Australia's favour. I am talking about the Jeremiah type of attitude that comes from the opposition in this House day in, day out. When we get low inflation, when we get low interest rates, when we get high rates of growth, the opposition comes into this House and tries to constantly talk down this country's chances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the sorts of fallacies that are coming from the opposition, and the sort of nonsense that was put forward yesterday by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), can have adverse consequences. The recent speech by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Mr Macfarlane, sets about outlining the things that run in this country's favour, the things that will give us a much brighter and prosperous future; and there is so much that is going right in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To assess what is going right in this country, we need to understand what has occurred in the past. A very important part of the speech given by the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank is where he points out that the real deterioration in Australia's economic performance occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. That was the time when this country's performance fell well below that of the rest of the world. He argues, looking at an assessment of inflation rates, balance of payments and unemployment rates for the period of the 1960s and the 1970s, that the real period of deterioration of Australia's economic performance was in the 1970s rather than the 1980s. I would like to quote very briefly from the speech that he gave. The Deputy Governor went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While economic pessimism reached its peak in the 1980s, it was a lagged reaction to our economic performance, which had its most serious period of deterioration in the 1970s. For example, if we look at the balance of payments, it is now clear that the period of deteriorating performance was from about the early 1970s until the mid-1980s. Since then, there has been a slight upward trend in the trade position and a stabilisation in the current account position.</PARA>
<PARA>And he argues similarly on inflation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the damage was done in the 1970s and the early 1980s. The average rate of inflation between 1973 and 1983 was 11.3 per cent, whereas in the most recent decade it has been about half of that, and over the most recent three years it has been less than two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>He argues that we have made very substantial economic progress in the 1980s, that we have been dealing with the fundamentals of the economy and that the time when we had real problems in this country was the time when those opposite were actually in charge of the affairs of this country. Sure, we are going to have to work hard, but what he goes on to talk about in that speech are the things that we are doing right in this country and the things that are working in our favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, he makes the very important point that we are now, in terms of our economic development, for the first time in a couple of hundred years in the right position in the globe, that is, we are closer to Asia than we are to Europe and North America. That means that we can plug into the growth opportunities arising from Asia. Secondly, he points out that we run a balance of payments surplus with Asia, so we have a surplus with the fastest growing region in the world, and that is very good for the medium-term development of this country. Thirdly, he points to the phenomenal growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures in recent years. The lesson from all of this is that, whilst we must maintain our capacity for self-criticism, we cannot let the pessimism that comes from those opposite stifle what are very bright prospects for this country into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, I guess, brings us to a discussion of what are the policy alternatives. The government has put forward its priorities for the year ahead. But what sorts of priorities is the opposition putting forward? What is the policy option that the opposition is putting forward in response to the budget and the white paper initiatives? As recently as 16 May the new Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), was quoted as saying that, while Fightback was dead and buried, aspects of it needed to be developed and improved upon. This is the same person that was criticising the Hawke and Fraser governments for being too gutless to introduce a GST. Now he expects us to believe that he has got rid of all the baggage of support for a GST and he no longer believes in Fightback. This is the same person who we have had masquerading on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> as a nice, compassionate guy, a sensitive new age person out there with his little Victa mowing his 3,000 acres of lawn, pretending that he is somehow different from what he has been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that in policy terms he is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and we can see that if we look at some of the statements he has been making about the desirable levels of taxation in this country. He has been making statements that we should have Asian levels of taxation. Of course, if we were to adopt Asian levels of taxation, we would have to cut public spending in this country by somewhere between $11 and $30 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote what the honourable member for Mayo had to say in a speech entitled `Australia-East Asia: Comparison of Economic Performance 1988-92'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister will have to accept that the level of taxation in Australia is too high. It is a fact that spending levels in Australia are over twice as high as East Asia. Mr Keating should substantially reduce taxes.</PARA>
<PARA>So he is calling for a tax regime similar to Asia's. If we were to adopt Indonesian levels of taxation, that would mean cutting spending in this country to the tune of $12 billion a year. That would be the equivalent of cutting out all current spending on aged care. If we were to move to the level of taxation that they have in Taiwan, that would mean cutting public spending by $33 billion a year, which would mean abolishing all the expenditure on veterans affairs, $3.9 billion; assistance to families with children, $9 billion; assistance to the unemployed and the sick, $7 billion; and assistance to the aged, $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the program that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. He is trying to mutate from a hardline dry into some warm, compassionate, cuddly, middle-of-the-road politician. The truth is that when one looks at his past statements on economic policy it is clear that the opposition still favours massive cuts to public expenditure, the abolition of the industrial umpire, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to look at what has been said in recent days by the new opposition frontbench. It has not changed all that much: it is really yesterday's men replacing yesterday's men. We might have a few new spokes, we might have a new Leader of the Opposition, but it is the same old flat tyre. It is the same old bunch of people on the opposite side in this House advocating the same old dry Thatcherite policies that we have heard from the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and from all of yesterday's men who continue to rotate positions on the opposition frontbench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk a little about the new Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo. The honourable member for Mayo has spent something like a third of his life living in Great Britain. No wonder he is such an admirer of Thatcherite type policies; no wonder he is such an admirer of the Adelaide Club and the Melbourne establishment. When the Leader of the Opposition comes into this House and pretends to be in touch with ordinary families or when he goes on television and pretends to be in touch with the ordinary concerns of people, people should bear in mind that he is someone who could not be further from the needs, aspirations and concerns of the average Australian. That is why I concur with the recent assessment of the Liberal Party given by B.A. Santamaria in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> at the weekend. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is pre-eminently the party of new-rich practitioners of the money market, of property developers, of the rapidly growing gambling interests of alleged `entrepreneurs' and those who service them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new class does not talk the language of the ordinary people, by whose votes the politicians live or die. It has no community of interest or even contact with them.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could have community of interest or contact with ordinary people if they continue to spend considerable portions of their time at the Melbourne Club and at the Adelaide Club?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the rest of the frontbench. It is supposed to be lean, but the opposition frontbench has still got 44 people on it. That is not lean&mdash;it is still four more than the government&mdash;but it is certainly mean. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is affectionately known by the Premier of Victoria as `Dog'. If that is what his friends call him, what do his enemies call him? Is that some sort of reference to the fact that he would favour even more massive cuts to public expenditure than does the Premier of Victoria? Is that what the term `Dog' refers to? Does it refer to a much harder line in terms of public policy? Can we expect an even harder line from the honourable member for Higgins than we have already had from the Premier of Victoria?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson is now in the industry portfolio. This is the man who believes in zero tariffs and scares the living daylights out of any serious manufacturer. There is Dr Kemp in the employment portfolio who does not believe in labour market programs. We have got his brother Rod in the shadow ministry and he ran Margaret Guilfoyle's razor gang for Malcolm Fraser. Finally, there is Ian McLachlan from the slash and burn school of environmental concern. So what we now have on the opposition frontbench is the hard Right of the Liberal Party; there is one wet in a shadow cabinet of 19. There has been a  substantial demotion of those who believe in middle-of-the-road policies, because something like 10 of Dr Hewson's former shadow ministers have been demoted or sacked. The bias is pretty clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How new is the frontbench? It is not very new; there are three former leaders of the opposition sitting there. In the armed forces when the generals retire they all head out to the private sector, but in the Liberal Party they stay in the command structure. More retired generals now are sitting along the opposition frontbench than there are in the whole Israeli army. It is a frontbench of yesterday's men replacing yesterday's men. Nowhere is that more the case than in the Queensland Liberal Party representation on the frontbench. Two former ministers have been replaced by two former ministers, and there has been a substantial reduction in Liberal Party representation from Queensland. In fact, the elevation of John Moore means less: Moore means less with the Queensland representation in the shadow ministry. </PARA>

It was extraordinary to me, who had served in the Queensland parliament and the party that ran the government for 21 years, in so far as a high-flying speculator from Western Australia, a one-time associate of Alan Bond, purchased something which, on the face of it, was absolutely worthless.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Truss)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The situation is that the honourable member cannot table documents without leave of the House. When he has completed his speech, I will give him the opportunity to seek leave to table them. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX4">Mr KATTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are wise enough to have heard me say that I was going to table all of them at the end of my speech. If honourable members opposite try to stop them from being tabled, that is their privilege. There will be many attempted cover-ups as this matter unfolds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To continue, he had the ability to turn Pivot's authority to prospect, according to Senator Richardson in the federal cabinet document dated July 1990, into an asset worth $270 million a year. So this is a pretty amazing power that Senator Richardson has: he can turn a lemon worth absolutely nothing into something that, according to him, is worth&mdash;as it says in the cabinet document, I must emphasise&mdash;$270 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important fact here is that the National Party in Queensland would not allow mining. The federal government, whether it was led by Mr Fraser or Mr Whitlam or Mr McMahon, had not allowed mining for 21 years. The reason for that is well illustrated. I refer to a document that I will in due course be tabling, which is the RAKES report. RAKES stands for rapid appraisal of key endangered sites. It was a study undertaken by Stanton and Morgan of the University of New England's School of Natural Resources in 1977, and it was undertaken for the Queensland government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That study ranked all of the sites in order of heritage listing and found that Shoalwater Bay was the No. 1 ranked site in Queensland. It was ranked over the Daintree, over the rainforests, over the Great Barrier Reef, over everything. I venture to suggest that since Queensland has the barrier reef and the rainforests we can safely construe that that site was ranked number one in Australia. That is why even a government such as the one that I belonged to, which was almost fanatical about development&mdash;and our opponents accused us of that on many occasions&mdash;was not prepared to go in and mine Shoalwater Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great number of bodies were opposed to the mining of Shoalwater Bay. They included the Livingstone Shire Council, which is a very development oriented council of the National Party persuasion; Senator Richardson's own departments of administrative services, environment and tourism; and the Queensland Water Resources Corporation. I will table document No. 9, which is the letter from the Queensland Water Resources Corporation, which outlines the reasons why it was opposed to the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other bodies were the CSIRO; the Department of Defence; the Australian Heritage Commission; the Queensland Commercial Fishermen's Organisation; the RAKES report, which I referred to before; the federal ALP member for the area; the local National Party MLA for the area; Mr Whitlam's government; Mr McMahon's government; Mr Fraser's government; the Australian Conservation Council; the RSL; and the Queensland Professional Officers Association, to name but a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I could name 53 bodies whose duty it was to assess this area and which assessed it as an area that was not to be mined. Incredibly, that list includes the Bureau of Mineral Resources. I refer again to the cabinet document which states emphatically that the Bureau of Mineral Resources says that there is a 98 per cent chance that the resource is non-viable. So the bureau said that there is no value in mining the resource. That is in sharp contrast to the statements of Senator Richardson. It is interesting to contemplate why he was making statements on the issue of mining which were so completely different from those of the government's own Bureau of Mineral Resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find that there was only one person in a position of responsibility in Australia who was for the mining of this resource, and that was Senator Richardson. This is quite extraordinary, because Senator Richardson was the man who went to North Queensland and made the World Heritage listing which put 1,000 timberworkers&mdash;and that is not my figure, it is Mr Hawke's figure&mdash;out of work. It closed the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric operation which was being built and which was scheduled to employ 1,000 employees that year. The Oyster Point development, with 300 workers, was also closed. So that was 2,300 people whom he had not hesitated to put out of work in that period, and yet here he is suddenly becoming a developer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government was never accused of being green, yet the king of heritage listings is about to mine an area that we would never have been prepared to mine. Why did Senator Richardson propose the rape and pillage, to quote the locals, of what a unanimity of scientific expert opinion, public opinion and every government&mdash;local, state, federal&mdash;agreed was the last pristine wilderness?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did Peter Laurance buy the world's greatest lemon? I ask myself why this super clever, super corporate high-flier wunderkind of the tourism industry, darling of the Goss government, is buying the world's greatest lemon, a parcel of authorities to prospect over a resource that could never have been mined in the past nor ever could have been in the future. However, if you knew that one of the most powerful men in Australia would decide to grant you mining leases, then you would have bought a resource not worth Senator Richardson's $270 million a year but, yes, worth maybe $90 million a year. I make the point to the House that Mr Laurance had already received $2.2 million for leases that were absolutely worthless on Fraser Island. If you had bought it for a veritable peppercorn&mdash;after all you already have $2.2 million&mdash;then you truly would be the prince of entrepreneurs. You would have bought something worth absolutely nothing, knowing that very soon it was going to be worth $90 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you came out of Western Australia, where this sort of operation was regarded as standard operating procedure&mdash;after all, you were trained under Alan Bond and Brian Burke&mdash;this would be the way you would have been trained to do business. After all, he had the protection of Senator Richardson and made himself the super green hero of Australia over the broken backs of 2,300 workers in North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that what was always being done here was a scam for compensation, the same as was worked by the state government for Peter Laurance on Fraser Island. Firstly, I submit as evidence page 5 of the cabinet submission, document 4, attachment G, using Pivot Murphyores's own data:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bureau of Mineral Resources has established the profit from the mining lease to have a 98 per cent probability of being zero or less.</PARA>
<PARA>So the expert opinion of the government says that they could never make any money out of mining it. So why were they so determined to mine it, and why was the good senator so determined to mine it if his own government department&mdash;the Bureau of Mineral Resources&mdash;said it was not going to be making any money out of it? Of course, if the game was always for compensation, then it was a game that was going to pay people an awful lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the marketplace decided that the mineral lease was worth only $350,000 because that is what Laurance supposedly&mdash;and I emphasise supposedly&mdash;sold the Shoalwater Bay mining leases to Ron Sheehan at Western Australia for. He sold them for $350,000&mdash;that was all. Really that is nothing in mining terms. So the market opinion was that the leases were worth nothing as far as mining goes. I might add here that Ron Sheehan, in an article which is also being tabled here, agreed that he had been the beneficiary of a very good deal. When asked about the fact that he now had a very valid claim for compensation worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he agreed that he had been the beneficiary of a very good deal. I'll say! He bought something for $350,000 and had created a substantial claim worth hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I table as evidence a document marked 9, a statement from the then director of the Capricorn Conservation Council. This is an extract from the notes she took at the time where she is quoting the AMIC environment consultant, Geoff Farnell:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why weren't Pivot here at these field inspections? They are arrogant . . . and are looking for compensation. Companies like Pivot do no credit to our industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the mining opinion. So there was the expert opinion of the government saying it was worth nothing; there was the market saying it was worth a measly $350,000&mdash;and even that, I suspect, is a scam&mdash;and there was the mining opinion saying it was worth nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on. Presumably other people in other places will be taking note of some of this material that we are putting forward here. I am switching subjects very dramatically here. I want to refer to a report from the Queensland special task force. This report reveals:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government's recent budget and white paper provide Australia with the opportunity to move towards the year 2000 to capitalise on the recovery and ensure that the benefits are shared amongst all Australians. This government is fully committed to ensuring that the levels of economic growth currently being experienced are sustained and built upon. It is a simple matter of fact that without sustained and high economic growth, jobs will not be created and unemployment will remain unacceptably high. What has been forgotten is that it was this Labor government that was responsible for generating 1.6 million new jobs between 1983 and the end of the 1980s. We did it then and we can do it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic settings are in place for continued high and sustained growth. GDP is growing at over four per cent, inflation is low at less than two per cent, and exports continue to grow strongly, being up 176 per cent over the last 10 years. Economic growth is already translating into jobs with over 170,000 new jobs created since the March 1993 election, well ahead of the government's commitment to creating 500,000 jobs over the three years of the current accord. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that jobs growth will be sustained and enhanced. A study by the Department of Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Workforce in the Year 2001</EMPHASIS> has concluded that the economy is capable of generating about 1.4 million new jobs over this decade. This is a realistic goal and the measures announced in the white paper to encourage investment, improve business performance and enhance export growth will build on the strong base of international competitiveness we already have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second fundamental point is that the white paper initiatives are also aimed at two other key goals&mdash;integrating the long term unemployed back into the labour market as well as ensuring skill blockages do not constrain economic growth. The white paper contains some innovative initiatives to achieve both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will provide an additional $770 million over the next four years to expand entry level training places by 50,000 per annum, an increase of 50 per cent over current levels. These additional places will be created through expanding traditional apprenticeships and traineeships as well as creating new ones in areas such as the environment and community services. Enhanced incentives to employers will encourage the take-up of these traineeships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the lead-up to the white paper the government consulted widely with business and was greatly encouraged by the willingness of employers and their associations to work in partnership with the government to secure the expansion of traineeships. These discussions have led to initial pledges for traineeship and apprenticeship positions approaching 25,000 places. I am pleased to see a number of prominent Australian companies included on this list such as Coles Myer and Telstra. I believe that other companies such as the National Australia Bank, McDonald's and the Sportscraft group are intending to expand trainee numbers provided that their current Australian Vocational Training Certificate System pilots are successful. I would encourage other companies to examine their current training arrangements and make similar commitments. As well, a number of major Australian companies are already trialling the new AVTCS pilots thereby demonstrating their commitment to the training reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to suspend the training guarantee levy is based on the expectation that employers and employees will continue to meet their training responsibilities. The government is prepared to abolish the TG provided that employers take up the additional training places funded in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also reached agreement with the ACTU on training wage rates. The new rates will be available whether or not wage subsidies apply or the person concerned is long term unemployed. The rates will apply if approved training is undertaken on or off the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the agreement with the ACTU the adult training wage rates will be linked to skill levels. These rates represent 80 per cent of the key award base rates determined by the 1989 national wage case minimum rate relativities decision. In addition, a new simplified wage structure for youths undertaking training will be implemented. Unlike adult training wages, youth training wages already exist. However, they are confusing&mdash;some do not operate, they are aged based and often inconsistent with minimum rate relativities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new structure simplifies the rates but delivers more flexibility and enterprise relevance in the training. The rates will be training and experience based, not age based. In all cases, the training required to qualify for the rates must be approved and lead to portable qualifications, and normally would be expected to equate to about a day's training a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are thus two distinct streams with separate qualifications: wage subsidies based on the level of disadvantage, and training wages which relate to approved training. They can be accessed simultaneously. Combined, they can result in a cost to employers of as little as $10 per week, but the individual will get a job, training that leads to a qualification, and secure an award based rate of pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to get industry behind the training wage and to provide a new mechanism for fast-tracking the approval of companies' training programs, Nettforce will be established. Nettforce will work with employers to secure industry commitment to providing training and work placement opportunities for the unemployed and will build on the success of the Fox-Kelty initiative. It will also be responsible for providing interim approval of companies' training programs where there are delays or impediments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nettforce will be chaired by Lindsay Fox, a man who has shown his commitment to helping the unemployed get jobs and to convincing employers that they have the capacity to be able to employ more people. I attended a business breakfast in my electorate at Cranbourne last week and Mr Fox was the guest speaker. He called upon employers to see what they could do to provide jobs and support initiatives to address unemployment. Mr Fox quoted Henry Ford, the American industrialist, who said, `If you think you can, or if you think you can't, you're right.' This means that if society is prepared to be positive, the scope is there to succeed. If not, we will indeed continue to have problems of a greater magnitude than the circumstances require. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall economic fundamentals are there to encourage investment and economic growth. The white paper goes further in assisting employers to take up the challenge. The white paper contains a number of important initiatives to better service employers' recruitment needs and make service delivery more demand driven and responsive to industry needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives include 300 dedicated employer servicing units to deliver a consistently high-quality service to employers; CES officers will be placed in industry associations to provide better access to programs and to promote the new initiatives; 60 area consultative committees will be established to ensure CES service and programs complement regional development initiatives; efforts will be made to cut the red tape by reducing the paperwork burden for business; and $5 million dollars will be provided to address the special recruitment and training needs of small business, including advice on accessing programs and group training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers are concerned that many of the long-term unemployed are not `job ready' because they have been disconnected from the labour force for a considerable period. The government recognises industry concerns in this regard. It has designed the job compact to provide for case management to get people `job ready'&mdash;provided either by the CES or private providers&mdash;a choice of potential employees, and a trial period to ensure that an employee is suitable for the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to improve the quality of service to employers and the unemployed, and to get better job matching, the government will introduce competition for the CES. Case management and job placement will be provided by community and private providers as well as the CES. In order to ensure fair and open competition, a new independent regulatory body, the Employment Service Regulatory Agency will be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dramatic changes in the labour force over the last 30 years mean that low-skilled jobs are no longer readily available for school leavers. Teenagers are often disadvantaged in competing for newly created jobs because of their relative lack of work experience, skills and qualifications. The white paper package addresses this by providing improved vocational preparation through two new initiatives, the youth training initiative and the establishment of the Australian student traineeship foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These initiatives will lead to an improvement in the quality of young people entering the work force. The youth training initiative, YTI, will ensure that every young unemployed person has access to a suitable education, training or work experience opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The YTI will provide case management for young unemployed people who have been without work for 13 weeks. Case management involves an initial assessment of skills and knowledge in key areas as the basis for job placement or further training. Where a job is not immediately available, a training agreement will be developed to assist the person into the work force. Access to a range of training programs will be possible under the scheme. The training provider will generally be accredited and will provide young people with a basis on which they can build further training at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the curriculum for upper secondary school students is primarily oriented towards the needs of higher education. However, only approximately 30 per cent of school leavers go straight on to higher education. There is a need to provide upper secondary school students with greater choice in preparing for their post-school careers. In particular, there is a need to broaden the opportunities for young people, to prepare them better for work and to improve the school to work transition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASTF will be charged with the responsibility for forging closer links between industry and school programs. The government will provide $38 million over four years for this. The ASTF will allow school students to combine their studies with work based learning and off-the-job training. Students will obtain a leaving certificate that recognises the vocational component of their schooling. The national program will build on a number of successful ABCTS pilot and state programs already under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Critics of the white paper raise a number of issues, many of them already canvassed today by those opposite. We hear that the unemployed do not need more training; they just need jobs. This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the circumstances faced by many unemployed people, many of whom lack appropriate skills to compete for vacancies in the job market. We hear that we need real jobs, not traineeships. Of course we need real jobs. I said earlier that 170,000 jobs have been created since the 1993 election, and it is clear that we will exceed the 500,000 jobs over three years target&mdash;a target the opposition said was impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point regarding traineeships is that about 80 per cent of trainees so far employed had been kept on subsequent to the subsidisation concluding. Real jobs are being created by giving employers the chance to utilise traineeships, and the unemployed the opportunity to prove their potential. We also hear from the opposition crocodile tears regarding the social impact of unemployment, but it is manifestly from its own policy positions, at least those that we last knew of, that the unemployed would be in a more disadvantaged position under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also hear that the government is going on a massive spending spree. I quote from Tim Colebatch of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in an article which appeared on 5 May 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The white paper is not the best we could do to bring back full employment. But given the political pressures on Labor to avoid tax rises and hold down spending, it is a pretty good second best.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has seen the Canberra bureaucracy do what it does best: target new spending tightly to the areas seen as priorities for Australia's long-term economic development&mdash;and make the system a little fairer on the side. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a quicker way to restore full employment: raise taxes on those with jobs and use the money to employ those without. But the Government, fearing the political costs, declared it would raise taxes only if the community was in favour. And clearly it was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, we have chosen the long road. Jobs will come back via the normal business cycle, the improved competitiveness, the flexibility in export focus of Australian firms, by low growth in real wages and by ensuring that the long-term unemployed do not become unemployable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Opposition's rhetoric, the white paper is offering cheap solutions to big problems. For 1994-95, its new spending adds up to $49 per person for employment and training, plus another $4 for industry, $2 each for regional development, science and income support, and $1 for trade. Total cost: $60 per head. That spending will peak at $100 per head in 1996-97. A spending spree? Let's get real.</PARA>
<PARA>As Mr Colebatch basically said, the white paper is not a quick fix option. It will not end unemployment tomorrow. But it was not intended to do so, nor is that objective really possible or practical. However, it does put in place an integrated, targeted program designed to facilitate the continuing economic recovery and to ensure that economic, and therefore jobs, growth continues. It will assist the unemployed to be better able to compete for vacancies and therefore more likely to get a job. It provides real incentives for employers to employ those who have been out of work for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will improve the operation of the CES and develop other forms of assistance to help place unemployed people into real jobs. The social security changes will encourage people to seek work and will remove disincentives within the system. The regional development initiatives will facilitate local regions to maximise their local advantages and help put them into a position where they can move forward and assist in job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is a worldwide problem; it cannot be fixed overnight. The white paper provides an opportunity to put Australia in a position to address it over time. We would all wish to remove the plight of unemployment tomorrow, but it is not going to be that easy. We certainly will not see the unemployment problem solved by the coalition. Its approach of massive spending cuts and benefit reductions will increase the hardship that it presently decries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an opportunity through the white paper&mdash;an opportunity to move forward as a nation to address long-term problems with lasting solutions. We owe it to the nation to take that opportunity; we owe it to the next generation of Australians. If employers and the community as a whole embrace the opportunities presented in the white paper, we have a good chance of succeeding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address just a couple of comments that were made by previous speakers. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) made great play of the new frontbench. He mentioned that it had not actually been reduced, as was claimed. I remind the people of Australia and perhaps the government as well that it has the facilities of government. I also understand that in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet alone there are literally hundreds of people at the Prime Minister's beck and call. When we compare the resources available to government and the resources available to the opposition, it is scandalous to think that members of the government are going to criticise us for the way we organise our frontbench.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin), who has left the chamber, that the government claimed some years ago that it was going to reduce, or eliminate, Commonwealth debt, but we discover in this budget that over the three years leading into June 1995 the Commonwealth government debt has gone from $30 billion to what will become $95 billion in June 1995. There is only one group which is going to pay for that&mdash;the Australian people. So let us get Australia's debt into context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the main purpose of my discussion here today, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1994-95. At the risk of reviving the tobacco debate, I want to focus my budget response on the subject of health hazards. Simply put, I think this government is a health hazard to the Australian people. The slogans `Labor is a health hazard' and `Labor is injurious to your health' should be displayed on the sides of buses. Labor reduces our economy's fitness and in doing so reduces the fitness of the Australian people. One has only to listen to what people are saying and take notice of surveys, such as the recent ABS survey, to see how much sicker our society is becoming as a result of Labor policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a youth suicide rate which is amongst the highest in the world. We see one million people unemployed and another million willing to work if jobs were available. We see an increasing reliance on charities, even by people who are in employment and people who are home owners. We see the highest levels of welfare dependency in decades. In 1973, 13.5 per cent of Australians over 16 received a government benefit. By 1993, this number had increased to 33.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see an increasingly large gap between the rich and the poor. The top 10 per cent of earners have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since 1983. My electorate of Grey contains many of the bottom 10 per cent of income earners even though it produces 50 per cent of South Australia's exports&mdash;such is the reward for exporters that this government claims to be providing for so well. The bottom 10 per cent of income earners have seen their real wages fall by five per cent. The government may well point out a myriad of programs which give $2 extra to a single parent here and a dollar extra to a pensioner there, but it cannot dispute the increasing gap between rich and poor, because the facts are there in black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recalled his favourite fairy tale: the coalition would abolish unemployment benefits after nine months. For some months now the Prime Minister has been playing the game of trying to convince the Australian people that at the last election the coalition was going to abolish unemployment benefits. It is just another of the Prime Minister's more blatant untruths. This was not the policy which the coalition took to the previous election. The coalition abandoned this policy suggestion, as it is clearly allowed to do&mdash;just as the Labor government did this week when we witnessed its recent backdown on the industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, Labor has left the unemployed behind. Labor has been in government for 11 years. Let us not forget that. That is ample time for a government to introduce policies to get the economy on track and to look after the wellbeing of the Australian people. What do we see? We see the kind of social dislocation which the ABS survey highlighted in a community and in a country which has prided itself on its egalitarianism and fairness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's damage to Australia has been compounded by the 1994-95 budget, the so-called soft budget which supposedly does not raise taxes. The government breathed a sigh of relief when the budget received a relatively calm reception last month as compared with the debacle of the previous budget. We all remember when most members of the caucus trudged down to see the Prime Minister and the then Treasurer to get a whole range of things altered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset in this year's budget there was substantial doubt about the budget's predictions and its heavy reliance on growth in business investment. This doubt has grown every day as we await business investment. Doubts about the budget predictions will not be silenced by the Prime Minister's attack on banks, financial markets, business or any other group which he wishes to blame. The blame lies solely and squarely with this government. Labor has been in power for 11 years and, at the end of its term, it will have had 13 years to solve the issues of Australia. There can be no-one else to blame. Labor must eventually run out of scapegoats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this month the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> described the budget as `a bit like applying the accelerator to a car coasting gently downhill'. I add that, as we coast downhill, the government is fervently hoping business can be made the scapegoat again. However, business does not appear to be coming to the party. Who can blame it? What has this government ever done for business, except lumber it with its industrial relations legislation? I am glad to see the government is approaching a backdown on the new legislation. The government lumbered business with a training guarantee levy&mdash;another backdown; I guess the government is learning something&mdash;the fringe benefits tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and all the rest of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come to the budget's commitment to regional Australia. A total of $70 million over three years is earmarked for a regional infrastructure fund and $80 million over three years for a regional best practice program. That is very good but, considering that the government will reap an extra $1 billion from the increase in fuel tax in the coming year, with $400 million coming from the tax on diesel, I would have thought it could have managed something a little more appropriate for regional electorates. After all, Labor can manage $50 million for a new flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we combine the $80 million and the $70 million for regional Australia over three years, it amounts to one-third of what the government is prepared to spend on regional Australia&mdash;one-third of what it is prepared to spend helping our regions grow, helping our regional families regain some prosperity and helping regional Australia attract investment. My electorate has a great reliance on exports, particularly agricultural exports. Farmers, if they are lucky, earn half the average income. We are currently facing a drought, so it will be considerably less than that. Twenty years ago farmers earned double the average wage. That is the way the government rewards exporters, particularly those in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Labor will spend $150 million on regional Australia while, at the same time, it will spend $50 million doodling around with our flag, playing with new designs and presumably trying to sell the idea of a new flag to the public. So it is $150 million for regional Australia versus $50 million for a new flag which we are not sure anyone really wants. Would anyone say this is a fair comparison? Would anyone say this is a fair deal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does the Labor government explain this to regional Australia? How does it explain its priorities? The answer is this: the government does not explain anything to regional Australia. It stays well clear of regional Australia. The government sent Bill Kelty to discover regional Australia. Old Bill wandered around out there. He had probably never been there before. He came out from Melbourne and probably needed a very good road map. He produced this lovely coloured report, went back to Melbourne and then waited for Canberra to consider his great wisdom. Canberra quickly buried his findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regional Australia waited for the government's response to Kelty's task force report, the government's statement on new policy directions for regional Australia, and the industry report. What did we get? We got Working Nation. If there is any title which sums up the hypocrisy of the Labor government it is that title. It would have been more aptly described as `Training Nation'. Training, training and more training is all this government has to offer our unemployed. Training helps prepare people for jobs and training is integral to our becoming a competitive nation. However, this government is simply recycling people through training course after training course, moving them on to different government benefits and generally shuffling the figures and biding time, hoping the unemployment problem will go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> How about some other titles for Working Nation? Perhaps we could call it `Stagnation' or, in regional Australia, `Indignation'. We are really a waiting nation. We are waiting for this government to get its act together, introduce real reform and generate jobs. Unfortunately, 11 years is far too long to wait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Regional Australia continues to wait for some meaningful support from this government. This budget is a political budget and an election budget. In this budget, the government concentrates on grabbing votes rather than creating jobs or attending to a myriad of other problems it has created. Unfortunately, for regional Australia there are not many votes outside the cities; there are more votes in metropolitan Australia. There are also the swinging votes held by interest groups to think about. This government loves those swinging voters in the special interest groups. That is why the budget made some big bang announcements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One big bang announcement was the Aboriginal land fund. I am the first to advocate greater attention to Aboriginal issues in this country. However, this government's policies for Aboriginal Australia are plainly inadequate. I spent all of last week in the Pitjantjatjara lands in the north-west corner of my electorate. This is not the first time I have visited the lands and nor will it be the last. I met many Aboriginal people who are struggling to build up private enterprise and achieve greater self-development. But this government is still intent on treating them like a welfare case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This 11-year-old government has clearly been unable to go any way towards resolving the problems faced by our Aboriginal communities. An example is the recent report on water in Aboriginal communities entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water: a report on the provision of water and sanitation in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities</EMPHASIS>. The report simply says that the government still has not got the water supply right. The government has not even got the water supply for Aboriginal people right!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been acknowledged that the main barrier to achieving an adequate water supply is political correctness. We have heard a little about political correctness lately. This government has been too immersed in being politically correct by giving Aboriginal communities the supposedly best water supply system to notice that the best systems are not the right systems. The government has been too concerned about giving Aboriginal communities water systems which are the same as non-Aboriginal communities, because everyone is equal, rather than giving Aboriginal communities what is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one story from the report. An Aboriginal community was given a new water system with a new you-beaut filter system. Unfortunately, a member of the community died. The community members, for religious and cultural reasons, left their home site for about two weeks. When they returned, their water system had broken down. This occurred because the filter had been allowed to dry out while the community was away. It became brittle and, therefore, broke. If government representatives knew about the community's habits and lifestyle, this would not have occurred. This sums up the government's whole attitude to Aboriginal communities. Doing what is politically correct will salve its conscience. The conscience of the politically correct brigade is more important than doing what is right. So it is with the Aboriginal land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pitjantjatjara people have their land now. They have had it for over a decade. They are still struggling for self-development. They still need encouragement and incentive to achieve the development and enterprise which they aspire to. This government is simply too busy treating them like a welfare case to give them that encouragement and incentive. Other big bang statements included the breast cancer funding&mdash;which some say would have been better directed to existing establishments&mdash;the money for the Daintree and the money for our olympic athletes. They are all very worthy causes but clearly are targeted towards certain groups in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the environment. The Labor government is interested in a republic. In my electorate is Lake Eyre and the Lake Eyre catchment area. The government wanted to put it on the World Heritage listing, which effectively means locking away the land. World Heritage listing is something out of the United Nations. It is something created by good intent&mdash;we would hope&mdash;but it is created by many people who would not even know what a democracy was. Yet this organisation has the right to suppress my electorate and to suppress people whom I represent&mdash;to kick them off their land! Is that social justice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not talk about the International Labour Organisation, but I think it is time that the government looked at running this country for Australians rather than simply running it from Geneva or some other comfortable international position. The budget is simply a political document. It does not address the real needs of Australia. It will not solve the problem of the two million unemployed or give the two million unemployed people jobs. It will not start to address our savings problems and get on top of our Commonwealth debt. The budget is like the white paper; it is a document which is aimed at appeasing the Australian people while the government continues to wreck the economy. Therefore, I say that Labor is clearly Australia's most serious health hazard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper, the kernel of the budget, is a monumental effort to tackle the debilitating effects of unemployment. It provides some hope for those youths only staying at school due to the stark job picture. It enunciates and diversifies job and training commitments for the long-term unemployed. It encourages the jobless to exploit the increasing part-time opportunities through a modified earning allowance for unemployment benefits, widens incentives for employers to hire and retain people, sharpens Australia's overseas trade effort and makes tentative industry policy gestures. Additionally, it introduces the parenting allowance and makes each member of the married couple a separate, distinct entity for social security purposes. These are realities in Australian society that receive overdue practical recognition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed by the opposition that these moves are largely a sleight of hand to manipulate jobless figures. Admittedly, particularly in the context of yesterday's contribution by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) and her rather egocentric attempts to associate herself with the former British Prime Minister, the actions of the Thatcher and Major governments in Britain, where they have changed the definitions of `jobless' and `unemployment' 40 times to engineer cosmetic unemployment changes, provide an interesting parallel. However, the evidence is convincing that these initiatives and changes owe more to extensive study of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most particularly, these initiatives acknowledge the extensive growth of part-time work, which has been even more pronounced in Australia than in the United States, and the reality that these jobs have been disproportionately flowing to females and, more particularly, the spouses of the already employed. We thus find that in the OECD countries the proportion of women between 15 and 64 years of age within the labour force grew from 53 per cent to 60 per cent through the decade to 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A relevant part of the 1994 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Labor Report</EMPHASIS> cites a New York study which discovered that between 1977 and 1989 the proportion of men reporting significant conflict between work and family responsibilities increased from 12 to 72 per cent. We thus have a variety of factors evident here and overseas which are the driving force behind the changes the government has now introduced. These are ground swell changes, they are not a cynical exercise to disguise unemployment and underemployment. In Bruce Chapman's January 1994 paper entitled `The case for policy reform', he succinctly commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental point concerning the desirability of the Job Compact is that to be effective the arrangement must ensure that members of the targeted group are brought back into the world of mainstream work for periods extending well beyond the duration of the initial employment experience. Without this distributional benefits will be temporary only, and the medium term gains to the economy peripheral.</PARA>
<PARA>Measures in the budget go beyond this. It contains more than speculative efforts to tackle this situation. The refashioning of duration and maximisation periods of wage incentives are crucial for employers. An initially higher subsidy to overcome predictable doubts about the long-term unemployed due to stigmatisation is followed by a $500 bonus when a person has been employed for a year. Equally, the emphasis on skills is crucial given the acknowledged growth in wage disparities according to skills and education and the reality that Australia's opportunities lie in these sectors of employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These positive attractions to employing the long-term unemployed are accompanied by a radical alteration to wages with the introduction of training related schedules for both youth and older unemployed people. Understandably, the ACTU has been guarded in its approach to this issue, mindful of the widened possibility of abuse that can emerge. In the past there has been a questionable level of vigilance by government instrumentalities in relation to labour market subsidies to employers. This is typified in the largess shown to companies such as ADT Security, which received $437,000 in jobstart subsidies in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To all intents and purposes this was manipulated to give this company a distinct competitive advantage over other legitimate employers and destroyed the morale of hundreds of enthusiastic citizens who were hired in the process. How many of the 183 people hired are with the company in 1994? I predict that the CES has little interest in this issue. The desperation of the times and the lack of broader take-up under previous schemes dictates the need for some experimentation now. Let us hope that the union movement's willingness to recognise the national need is met with public service attention to the possible downside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efforts of the CES to be more receptive to industry needs should leave minimal grounds for complaints and inaction by employers. There will be 300 dedicated employers servicing units with a staff of 1,600 to deliver quality service. Officers will be situated within industry associations to widen knowledge of program availability. An effective instance of where this is already in place is the Local Government and Shires Association in New South Wales. Greater attention will be directed towards matching the unemployed with specific employer needs. Account specialists will seek to provide individual service to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest Department of Employment, Education and Training overview of the western Sydney region again highlighted the pronounced concentration of non-English speaking background people in the Auburn municipality. In the 1991 census they amounted to 42.8 per cent of the population. This is twice the level of the entire Sydney region. Similarly, Holroyd and Parramatta continue to have proportions in excess of the average. This in turn is crucially related to the unemployment pattern. It was again shown in the April quarter that the central west region had an unemployment level of 16.9 per cent compared to the Australian average of 11.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also of relevance that the central west region, encompassing these three councils, with a level of 6 1/2 per cent for English speaking migrants significantly trailed the Sydney picture of 12.1 per cent. Widespread analysis has highlighted not only that deprivation, that job and training access disadvantage faced by non-English speaking background people, but also the reality that English speaking migrants tend to fair far better in the labour market than Australian born citizens. These are intrinsic to the disgraceful unemployment picture in our region caused by the interrelationship of a lack of developed networks within factories and workplaces, non-acceptance of qualifications from overseas and the primary importance of English skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of my electorate, I commend the strong statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) which signalled that we should direct our efforts towards local skill formation rather than migration. The 1990s have witnessed an important and commendable reassertion of the need for Australia to profit as a nation from migration. Family reunion considerations lose nothing by also seeking people more likely to be employed. This has been occasioned by the reorganisation of the points system to give priority to those relatives who have higher levels of skill and youth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Finance. Given today's stronger than expected growth rate and the increases in bond rates which occurred as an immediate reaction to that, does this now confirm that official interest rates will rise in the near future, notwithstanding the Treasurer's statement to the contrary yesterday? Can the minister confirm that Australia is now heading for a high interest rate recovery?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not confirm that because it is a ludicrous proposition. As well as excellent growth coming through in these figures, which I am very glad to see that you conceded, there is also an extremely low inflation rate. Whilst the ground is there for a very substantial increase in business investment, that is yet to come through. All the indications are there that it will come through. Recently, the ACCI-Westpac survey reported, for example, that capital utilisation in business was at very high levels, higher levels than in the 1980s. Profits have increased by something like 130 per cent since the nadir of the recession in 1991. In that period there has been an increase in capital expenditure of only some four per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is nothing in any of these figures which suggests that an interest rate rise is anywhere near likely in the immediate future. The Treasurer pointed that out in his remarks yesterday and he pointed it out again at his press conference today. So the concerns of the Leader of the Opposition ought to be allayed by that. This is a growth out of recession, the like of which we have not experienced in the past&mdash;at least not for some considerable time in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal factors that would cause pressures for interest rates to rise, which are in very large measure delivered by an anticipation of a substantial increase in the rate of inflation, simply are not there. So I am pleased to be in a position to set the Leader of the Opposition's mind at rest on this matter. No doubt he will subsequently be able to report in his briefings to the media and others what I have been able to say to him.</PARA>

Can the minister provide details of the new measures?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1190" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question, and I acknowledge her ongoing concern for the position of women in this situation. This morning I announced a number of new measures that are of relevance to women who are widowed, divorced or separated, who are over the age of 50 and who have no recent work force experience. This follows from some of the consequences that we have experienced as a result of the decision made in 1987 to phase out the so-called widows B pension. This was a pension which was payable initially to women over the age of 50 who had no ongoing caring responsibilities; that is to say, they were not looking after children, not caring for a disabled relative or were not themselves disabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic premise behind this decision&mdash;which, as I have said, was made in 1987 and which, I might add, was supported by the opposition&mdash;at the time was basically to shift the assumptions that we make about women's participation in the work force. The fact is that there has been a major transformation in recent years in the degree of female participation in the work force. Taking women in the 45- to 54-year age group, around 70 per cent of single women and around 65 per cent of married women are active work force participants&mdash;and that represents a marked shift from a few years ago. I guess that means the idea that in the work force we have women who are considered to be dependent simply by virtue of being women, irrespective of whether they have caring responsibilities or not, was seen by the government, and is still seen, to be an anachronism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, having said that, we have to recognise that many such women have grown up with a set of expectations about their role. The fact is that the experience of the phasing out of the widows B pension has shown that a number of such women have experienced significant difficulties, particularly the older ones. With the way the phase-out operates, the woman has to be over the age of 50 as at July 1987 to qualify for the widows pension. Effectively, that has raised the qualifying age each year until now it is 56 years and 10 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of my colleagues, particularly the honourable member for Capricornia and also the honourable member for Macquarie, have drawn my attention to the serious difficulties that many such women, who have had no recent work force experience, have had in re-adapting to the work force. I think we have to take cognisance of that. In recognition of that, I announced a number of new measures this morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we are introducing a new widows allowance which will be available as a non-activity tested payment for women who have become widowed, divorced or separated over the age of 50 since 1987 and who have no recent work force experience. They will be able to receive a payment equivalent in rate to the JSA or newstart rate but without the activity testing and work testing requirements that attach to those payments. That new payment will come into force from 1 January next year. In the interim between now and then, we will be relaxing the reporting requirements necessary to qualify for JSA or newstart for women in that category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we are not saying to those women that we just expect them to go into a state of quasi retirement; we will continue to encourage and facilitate such women entering the work force. In order to give effect to that, we will be making access to the highly successful JET, jobs education and training program, which is currently provided predominantly to sole parent pensioners, and which is a demonstrably effective form of assistance to help such people gain access to the work force&mdash;that is, people who have no recent work force experience and who are experiencing significant difficulties in coming back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this measure will significantly alleviate the position of such people without compromising the overall objective that the government was seeking to achieve. The age at which people will be able to qualify for this new widows allowance will be frozen at 50 for the next 10 years. Thereafter, the qualifying age will rise by one year each year. That will bring it effectively into conformity with the eligibility conditions for the new non-activity tested partner allowance available for the spouses of unemployment recipients over the age of 40 and, again, without recent work force experience. I think we have to acknowledge that some of those people have difficulties. We have taken cognisance of that. A number of my colleagues have expressed serious concerns, and we have taken those concerns on board.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members and, I think, the general public would have some right in feeling somewhat cynical about another report about the necessary reforms for the justice system and improved access for ordinary Australians. Indeed, I think we could probably fill a small law library with similar reports over recent years. But what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to justice</EMPHASIS> report does is, in effect, examine the work of these other reports. It looks at the best practice of new initiatives being taken in a range of other jurisdictions throughout the states and at the Commonwealth level and at reforms being undertaken in the legal profession itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It endeavours to put together a comprehensive but practical plan for reforms which would improve the way our justice system operates.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 70-odd recommendations which canvass the role in which government operates, the way in which our legal aid system operates, the structure and best operation of the legal profession and the role the courts should play in the reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some commentators have said that the report is disappointing. I noticed in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a piece by a Mr Bruce Donald, who said that really all the Commonwealth should do is pass a single piece of legislation essentially nationalising, if you like, the legal system. This conveniently neglects to recognise the fact that Australia effectively is nine separate legal systems: the Commonwealth, the six states and the two territories. There is no single line of authority, no one government that is responsible for or that can take command of the reform agenda. In essence it requires a cooperative approach by all governments, by the profession and by the courts. Unlike reports in the past, I think there is now some ground for optimism that what is needed&mdash;and that is a sense of consensus in terms of achieving reform&mdash;is within grasp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the legal profession, particularly through the Law Council of Australia, undertake a very significant push towards getting a truly national legal profession. That aim is being well progressed. We have seen a number of states undertake their own reforms, most recently a package announced today by the Attorney-General of Victoria, Mrs Wade, outlining a range of reforms which are fully consistent with the recommendations in the Sackville report. We have seen very significant reforms recently in the state of New South Wales. I understand that the state of Queensland shortly will be bringing forward its own package. So I believe we have the background circumstances for there to be truly cooperative action across the states and the Commonwealth and with the courts and the profession to see some significant improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the government has acted quickly on the Sackville report. I have already announced a six-step plan in terms of the implementation of the committee's recommendation. Immediate steps which the Commonwealth can take, such as the examination of the tax deductibility of legal expenses, will be started shortly, as will a reference to the Law Reform Commission about the cost indemnity rule. The Attorney-General's Department, which is a major purchaser of legal services in this country, some $12 million annually, has taken steps to use its market power to provide a better informed legal market in terms of the cost of services. All these measures will go towards improving our legal system. But it will take goodwill and cooperation. The Commonwealth is certainly willing to play its part. I certainly believe the legal profession is. I now call on my state colleagues and other Australian jurisdictions to play their part in this vital reform process.</PARA>

It is a chronic condition. It is not something that can be cured. It is a condition that needs to be properly managed. It is a condition that for some time not many people knew much about. It is only in recent times that sufficient scientific evidence has become available to show just how serious this condition is.</PARA>

In the United States the number is as high as 50 per cent. It has become a very major problem not only for the veterans but for their families. Last week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> there was an article about the 19-year-old son of a Vietnam veteran, who was diagnosed as having secondary post-traumatic stress disorder.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, the Commonwealth's position and part of the cabinet decision regarding the settlement of these claims was that the Comcare legislation, particularly section 44 of that act, which removed common law actions by Commonwealth employees against the Commonwealth, would be a bar which the Commonwealth relied on. That bar does not apply to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> victims in any particular sense; it applies across the board. Claims have been made after that time and claims have been made more recently. No doubt claims have been made given the publicity which was generated at that time.

The position as it stands today is that all claims made prior to the introduction of that legislation have been negotiated, settled and paid.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Their response to Mabo was sterile, through you, Mr Speaker. The fact is that the High Court has found in common law a new form of land title known as native title. The essence is that that title should be treated like any other form of land title. Industry leaders have understood that and now recognise it. We have passed legislation to ensure certainty of past title, and we have now in place a regime which can give certainty over the use of future title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position in Western Australia is that the Western Australian government is, for instance, telling miners there that they must comply with its acts. It is now issuing titles that may not comply with the federal system and which may be held to be invalid at some stage in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a plea to miners in Western Australia that, in addition to complying with state law&mdash;which, of course, they must&mdash;they should not wait for the High Court to make a decision about the validity of our act. They should comply now with the national Native Title Act. If they comply now with our act, they will be certain that they are covered by our act. So, whatever the outcome of the High Court decision in six or 12 months time, they will have the certainty of the Commonwealth's act and will, of course, be complying with the state act. It is important that they do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In addition, I suggest that there are ways in which right here and now miners and other land users can have the certainty of the current Native Title Act; there is no reason why they should wait. These are the sorts of things that miners, for instance, and other land users can do to give certainty today to their future uses of land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the act includes a fast-tracked non-claimant process for determining whether native title exists over a particular area of land. This procedure is open to all states and territories as well as to those who already have an interest in land. Just two months after notification, a developer or anyone else can know whether the land is subject to a native title claim. If there is no claim, a government can then proceed to take action on the land&mdash;for instance, in giving the developer a grant or a licence&mdash;comfortable in the fact that the title and the action under it will be valid, even if native title should be established at some later point in time. Furthermore, the developer can be certain that it will not become liable for any compensation, regardless of any later valid native title claim. It is important that these people understand that the current act gives them that certainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As for mining companies, there are a number of things that they can do now to get access to certainty under the current Commonwealth regime. For instance, if a mining company has an existing interest in the land, such as an exploration licence, it can make a non-claimant application with all the benefits and certainties that I have just outlined. It can also encourage native title holders to enter into an agreement with the government under section 21 of the act so that the title holders can surrender their native title rights and interests by way of negotiation. That is available to miners today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it can also encourage state and territory governments to assist them where acts attracting the right to negotiate are proposed. Where a government follows the notification process and no native title claim is made within two months, mining activities can validly proceed, but subject to state and territory laws governing mining and land management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, another important element of this is that it is also possible for state and territory governments to facilitate exploration activity. They can propose that exploration methods with a minimal effect on native title be excluded completely from any right to negotiate procedures. I can inform the House that Commonwealth officials have recently indicated to all states and territories some broad guidelines for the application of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that industry groups should now be encouraging state and territory governments to submit exclusion proposals to the Commonwealth. I reiterate: there is a certain way through the native title issue, and that is to apply, use and access the Commonwealth's Native Title Act today. Whilst miners, for instance, must comply with state acts, they should also be ready to use the Commonwealth's act.</PARA>

I must say that the honourable member for Bennelong was on my mind when I set the limit for non-award contracts at $60,000, because that clearly means that Clayton Utz can sack you as soon as it likes, and it can do so without there being any protection at all for you under these provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

We now have a similar protection. It is a very fair protection and the minimum that should be available for all Australian workers. This government is very pleased and proud to be able to say that it will exist not only in New South Wales and not only in Western Australia. It will also apply in Victoria&mdash;one of the only two states where these protections have been ripped away.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What action is the government proposing to take following the public announcement from the ACT government that it will support a national approach to the banning of X- and R-rated computer games?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1200" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members might recall that the Commonwealth, with the support of the states and territories, introduced a scheme for the classification of computer games in April this year. That scheme basically reflected the scheme in place for film and videos, with the important addition of the classification of G8 to recognise the particular need of younger children, and the need for parents to be given guidance in the appropriate material for younger children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the scheme was introduced, a number of jurisdictions indicated that they would allow within their boundaries games up to a classification of X. Certainly a majority&mdash;at least initially&mdash;believed they would be allowing games up to a classification of R, which is the standard in film in video. Subsequently, all Australian jurisdictions, most recently now with the Australian Capital Territory, have indicated that they do not wish X and R computer games to be shown. That means that these games will now not be available at all in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes to amend the ordinance setting up the classification scheme to remove R and X games. Any games submitted for classification which would have otherwise fallen within those particular categories will now be refused classification. Up to this point, no game has been submitted for classification which would have fallen within the X and R categories. The government will also be changing its classification bill&mdash;which will be introduced and debated in the parliament a bit later this session&mdash;to remove X and R games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final matter which should be mentioned relates to the slightly different and stricter classification guidelines which apply to computer games. This flowed from a genuine community concern that the interactive nature of these games&mdash;in particular, the fact that they are very much targeted at children and young people&mdash;meant that there should be stronger guidelines in the classification system. However, it would be an odd result if a film were classified at, say, M level but, because it is being shown through a computer medium by way of, say, a computer laser disc rather than videotape, it were to end up with a different classification. That is possible given the slightly different and stricter classifications applying to computer games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the Commonwealth's concern, and I think the concern of honourable members and of the states, is the interactive nature of computer games and the need for a stricter system. If something is merely being shown in identical form, such as on a television through a videotape or on a computer screen through a laser disc, it is sensible that a similar classification be reached in terms of that product since there is a difference only in the technology; there is no difference in the end product. So we will need to clarify that particular situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the decision of the ACT government; I think it is a responsible one. It means that we have had a consensus of all governments in this country in terms of the showing of X- and R-rated computer games. I believe that it is a sound decision which all governments, again, have taken.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Preface</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This document continues the practice of presenting to the House of Representatives at approximately six-monthly intervals a schedule listing Government responses to House and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the House follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 25 May 1978 Prime Minister Fraser informed the House that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983, at which time the ministerial statement method of response was continued. More recently, the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by means of a letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the House at the earliest opportunity. However, for the purposes of this schedule, the date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Parliament has been taken as the date of the Government's response, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, or the reports of the House of Representatives Committee of Members' Interests, the Committee of Privileges, the Publications Committee and the Selection Committee. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes, which are tabled by the Committee. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We saw something that was very unusual earlier on this afternoon: we saw the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on his rostered day off, calling a press conference and sitting beside the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to try to bask in reflected glory over a beautiful set of numbers. He described them as the best set of numbers for 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could not help but go back and think of the way in which he used to gloat over figures whilst he was the Treasurer of this country in the mid- and late 1980s. Who will ever forget when he appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program in March 1993 and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean this is a beautiful set of numbers for us. For policy this is a beautiful set of numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>It was a precursor to Australia going into its worst recession in 60 years&mdash;a beautiful set of numbers. Who could ever forget the largess of expression when he talked about the effervescence flowing out over the cup? Who could help but feel a bit of a chill run down the spine as we saw the Prime Minister come out from his rostered day off and try to do the same thing with the rhetoric this afternoon?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a recession, the recession that followed closely on that beautiful set of numbers, in March 1990 to deal with the problem of the current account deficit. It was as a result of the sickness of the current account deficit that we had the treatment&mdash;the Keating treatment&mdash;of recession; a recession which was given to try to overcome the sickness of the current account deficit. He did not fix the sickness; the sickness is still there in the Australian economy. But now at last we are emerging from his treatment. That is what the economic recovery tells us: we are emerging from the treatment that the Prime Minister administered to try to fix the sickness. The sickness might still be there, but the good news for Australia is that we are now finally recovering from the Prime Minister's treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say on behalf of the opposition: we welcome growth in the Australian economy; we welcome it. The Australians who have been hard hit and pushed from pillar to post and wrung out through the wringer of the Keating recession&mdash;the recession that they had to have; the recession that he gave them; the recession that put a million people out of work&mdash;need some good news. The good news they need is that they are finally recovering from the treatment he administered to them in the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I say to those opposite: do not think for a moment that you can sit down, as the Prime Minister did, and say to the people of Australia, `It's all hunky dory; it's a golden age.' Do not think that anybody out there actually believes that the problems of the Australian economy are over; do not think that it is acceptable in this country to have 900,000 people out of work; do not think it is acceptable in this country to have a widening gap between the rich and the poor; do not think it is acceptable in this country to have the creation of a new underclass&mdash;the legacy of a decade of Labor&mdash;in Australian society permanently locked out of the work force, with unemployment being the great cause of poverty that it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the Prime Minister say in his press conference earlier on this afternoon that we are not going to see, under Labor, a class of working poor. No, we are not, because he has turned them into a class of workless poor. That is what he has done to them&mdash;locked them out of the labour market, locked them out of wages altogether and locked them out of all of the social stability that comes with that, all of the identity and meaning that comes with that. He has created a new class of workless poor, an underclass, in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Australia needs is sustainable recovery. It needs a recovery that can be sustained on a long-term basis. It needs a recovery that can grow, and that growth needs to be managed in a way that will really do something for all of the victims of the Keating recession&mdash;the men and women put out of work, those who are locked out in that lowest decile by the widening gap between the rich and the poor; those who are now part of Labor's underclass. What we need is sustained recovery built on sound foundations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's national accounts figures are good growth figures. As I said, we welcome growth. But, as the Treasurer himself admitted in his press conference earlier this afternoon, it is a growth based on consumption&mdash;two-thirds of it government consumption. It is not a growth which is soundly based on business investment, on new plant and equipment or on industry and business picking up, investing and employing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, today's national accounts figures show that there is a 6.8 per cent decline in expenditure on new equipment and that business investment is still showing a downward trend. They confirm the figures of last week which showed that private new capital expenditure was down in the March quarter by five per cent. Remember this: the crucial forecast in the government's budget was for a surge in private business investment. That is the crucial figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we woke up the day after the budget, we saw headline after headline in the Australian newspapers&mdash;`gamble', `gamble', `gamble', `gamble', `gamble'. The press said that the government, instead of taking an axe to its own expenditure and taking the advice of the Reserve Bank Governor, Professor Garnaut, Vince FitzGerald and the opposition and doing something about the fiscal deficit, had decided to gamble on private business investment. That was the big gamble&mdash;the big punt on private business investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we can say is that the recent figures show no sign of a surge in private business investment at all; no sign of that massive lift, no sign in the capital expenditure figures; no sign in the national accounts&mdash;no sign that business investment is coming back. To sustain recovery in this country, we need a recovery which is based on savings, investment and jobs. We need to switch from consumption to investment. The downside of the national accounts figures that have been released today is that they rely on consumption in the way that they do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about savings? These figures show the lowest household savings ratio in recent memory&mdash;and the figure is still falling. We are not seeing the savings which are necessary for investment and we are not seeing the investment which is necessary to fuel a continuous growth cycle. If we do not have that base for permanent substantive growth, we are going to go into the old boom-bust cycle again. We are going to hear all of those words come back to haunt the Prime Minister as they did last time&mdash;`effervescence' and `beautiful sets of numbers'. But it all turned to dust and dross as a result of the Keating recession that we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there was actually another purpose in today's press conference. I think it was an attempt to jawbone the markets. It was an attempt to say to the markets that the fears in relation to inflation and interest rates should not take hold. After the release of today's national accounts figures, the bond markets passed a verdict almost immediately. They pushed up bond rates in relation to not only three-year bond rates but also 10-year bond rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bond markets know what the government refuses to admit. They know that there will be a tightening of monetary policy. They</PARA>
<PARA>know that there is a problem in relation to interest rates and they are already beginning to factor higher interest rates into the equation. It is not as though the government makes out that interest rates are a problem that has been solved in Australia. Australia still has some of the highest real interest rates in the world. The Treasurer knows that to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we deduct the CPI figure from the prime bank lending rate, Australia has a real interest rate of around seven per cent. That figure compares with 3.7 per cent in Britain, 4.9 per cent in the United States and 1.7 per cent in Japan. Australia has high real interest rates&mdash;some of the highest in the developed world, surpassed only by that much admired laboratory for the ACTU, Sweden.

But we do not talk about Sweden any more because the Swedish experience has proved conclusively not to be an example in relation to Australia. The point is that Australia still has high real interest rates. When a country has high real interest rates they act as a disincentive to business investment, the engine that is needed for the economy to grow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bond markets have already made their judgment. As soon as the national accounts figures were released, they made the judgment that interest rates were on the way up. It was no good the Treasurer coming in here yesterday and saying that interest rates would not go up in the near future&mdash;I think that was the phraseology. Interest rates on the bond markets went up today. Everybody knows that real interest rates are already high and are going higher.

Eight weeks ago the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was proclaiming a new era of industrial relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today was a bad day for the new shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), to have to make his maiden speech in that position. Clearly today's numbers are very good results for the nation, very good results for the government and not so good for an opposition that wants to try to pretend that the economy is in bad shape. He spent a quarter of an hour trying to work up some gloom and doom, but at the end of the day the reality is that the Australian economy is growing faster than any other country in the Western developed world. That is the bottom line from today's figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that the recovery is here in a substantial way. Anyone who had lingering doubts about that after the December quarter accounts sees those doubts dispelled now. It is unambiguously clear that we have moved up to a strong rate of growth. That rate of growth is as high or higher than the growth rate of any other country in the Western world. That is the sort of bottom line from which discussion about the national accounts has to proceed. From there, where does the opposition go? The shadow Treasurer tried to say that we have a problem in the sense that this is not a sustainable recovery. Of course it is the opposition's role to try to find `dark clouds', a phrase he is wont to use in his press releases. But try as he may to work up some dark clouds, I must say to him that the economic weather is very bright and sunny out there. Most other people are reaching for their sunglasses, rather than looking at dark clouds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country is in a very good position for sustained economic and employment growth. There have been few times in its past when the nation has been so well-placed for sustained economic and employment growth as it is at present. That is the reality of our position as we see it. Indeed, I think it is the reality that many other people increasingly see. Before I pursue that point, let me say a little about today's figures, because they are important. The five per cent growth for the 12 months to March, on the seasonally adjusted figures, is probably a little above where we really are in terms of our trend rate. The trend rate as published by the Statistician for that 12-month period is 4.3 per cent. That is probably a more accurate picture of how the economy is really going because some one-off factors have pushed that rate up to the 5 per cent level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is a lumpiness of government consumption expenditure, both Commonwealth and state. This has meant that a lot of it has been deposited into the March quarter, giving a particular stimulus to growth in that quarter in a way which obviously cannot be sustained in other quarters. Also, in the private consumption area we had the particular fact of Easter coming just at the end of March and forcing the pre-Easter sales to come into the March quarter, thereby leading to a substantial real increase in retail sales in March and giving us a spurt in private consumption expenditure in the March quarter which obviously is not going to be sustained. So in that sense we had a couple of one-off factors which mean that the 12 months picture that we are looking at is not really the true picture of where are, although it certainly indicates that the economy is growing very strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend rate of 4.3 per cent is probably a better picture of where we are at present, but that in itself is the cause of an extremely good rate of growth, virtually as good as any other country in the Western world. The confirmation of that rate means that not only are we chalking up those figures now but we can have immense confidence about the future. Let me quote someone who is not normally noted for making complimentary remarks about the government or the economy. I refer to Mr Spicer from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who has issued a press release today entitled, `A very encouraging result'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's recovery is the real thing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not some mirage; it is the real thing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and in seasonally adjusted terms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he goes on to say that there is a five per cent annual growth rate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">takes Australia to the very top of the international growth rate league tables. Even private sector investment has contributed to Australia's rate of growth.</PARA>
<PARA>He talks about the 5.8 per cent figure, which includes the Gladstone powerhouse point that the shadow Treasurer mentioned. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is still a long way to go before we can actually say the economy has fully recovered, but it is well on the way. There are still tens of thousands of jobs to be created but the level of confidence demonstrated by this result will provide greater hope that the white paper employment targets can be achieved. The task now is to shift the level of public consumption to investment. In this respect the need to reduce public consumption spending remains paramount if the recovery is to be maintained. Nevertheless our growth rate is as good as can be hoped for at this stage of the cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>That, as I say, is from a source which has not been known for making complimentary remarks in the past. That is a clear appraisal by the ACCI of how it sees the situation. That will be, I am sure, the view, virtually universally, of the business and finance sectors of this economy as they look at today's figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's figures are not only good in the sense that they have that strong growth; they also have low inflation. Inflation in the 12 months on the implicit price deflator is less than one per cent. On non-farm GDP it is 0.7; for the whole GDP it is 0.9. There are various measures of inflation, but these are all-embracing ones. We normally refer to the CPI, which is currently 1.4 per cent. These figures are under one per cent. So we have strong growth of the economy&mdash;obviously strong growth&mdash;and, associated with that, very low inflation by our historical standards. That is exceedingly important in terms of having confidence about a sustained recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we have a sustained recovery. There is no doubt about that. No-one wants a short-term recovery which just fizzles out. We do not expect that to happen because we have in place the bases for a sustained recovery. It is argued by the opposition that it is not a sustainable recovery because we do not have business investment going yet. It is always the case that business investment takes a while to get going. In this particular recovery it has taken a long time to get going, that is for sure. There have been some particular factors associated with that. One is the fact that just prior to this recession we had a lot of heavy investment and the economy went into recession quite quickly. Then we had a lot of excess capacity. Companies have still got excess capacity but those capacity utilisation rates are moving up. As they move up further, there will be increased pressure for business investment. But you do not invest if you do not need to, if you can meet demand from your present level of capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business, to its credit, has been operating a lot smarter. Through enterprise bargaining and various other pressures for productivity improvement in a more competitive economy, businesses have been working their plant and equipment more efficiently and as a result they are able to meet demand without further investment. Those factors plus the balance sheet restructuring that has been going on&mdash;that is, getting rid of the excessive levels of debt that they built up at the end of the 1980s, rebalancing their balance sheets and using the high profit share that exists at present to get their balance sheets into shape&mdash;have been keeping investment down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now that is essentially a product of the past. The balance sheets have been restructured. The capacity utilisation rates are moving up, despite increased productivity. In those circumstances there is obviously increasing pressure on business to invest, otherwise it is going to see the opportunities by-pass it. Businesses will go somewhere else if they do not invest, so of course they are going to invest sooner or later. It has made sense for them not to invest to this stage but it will not make sense to keep on not investing because it will be forgoing good business opportunities. There are many other reasons why business would want to invest. It clearly has a strong recovery going; it has strong levels of demand&mdash;businesses can see that&mdash;and it has high profit share. The profit share today has moved up to virtually the highest it has ever been, just fractionally below the peak levels in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have strong profitability and a strong capacity therefore to invest. We have wages at low levels, inflation at very low levels, productivity improving and international competitiveness greatly improved. We are 30 per cent more competitive internationally than we were when this government first came into office. This is a fantastic array of conditions for increased business investment. We must expect that business will seize the opportunities. Business is not so stupid as not to do that. The fact that we have had low rates of business investment in the last couple of years does not mean that we cannot get a sudden turnaround. We have had periods like that in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1979-80 investment fell by 3.7 per cent and it increased the next year by over 17 per cent. During the recovery in the early 1980s we saw declines in business investment in 1982-83 and 1983-84 and it bounced back by over 14 per cent in 1984-85. Quite rapid turnarounds were common in our not too distant economic past. It makes sense. Once businesses as a group decide that it is time to get moving, they see the conditions and get into it. That is what we can expect to happen this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the capital expenditure figures which came out a week or so ago showed a fall in March, it does not mean that there is no likelihood of pick-up in investment in 1994-95. That survey shows that a substantial increase in business investment is expected in the June quarter and a further increase in 1994-95. We remain quite confident that the budget forecasts for both this year and next year&mdash;business investment for this year is basically expected to increase only by around one per cent and in 1994-95 to increase by some 14 1/2 per cent&mdash;are quite credible and appropriate. In those circumstances, we will obviously have that further condition we need to go on to the next stage of maturity in the recovery, which is to get that investment coming through. That will enable us to move on to a further stage in the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor that is mentioned as an inhibition to a sustained recovery is the current account. Some people, including those in the opposition, say, `You have some problems because you have a high current account deficit and with recovery that will go higher and you will have an incapacity, as we had at the end of the 1980s, to maintain growth.' In 1994-95 we will see an increase in the current account outcome from $16 billion to $18 billion. But we have to bear in mind that this year, 1993-94, we are doing much better on the current account than we forecast, despite lousy commodity prices that have just started to come around in the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commodity prices are obviously not helping us as a nation. We are still strongly reliant on exporting commodities, despite a significant spread in our exports over the last decade or so. With those low commodity prices, nevertheless we have been able to chalk up a much better current account outcome than we budgeted for&mdash;despite the fact that we are having much stronger growth than we budgeted for. We budgeted for 2 3/4 per cent GDP growth in 1993-94. It is currently running at 4 per cent or more, and over the last 12 months it has been at 4.3 per cent. Despite that, the current account outcome is still on line for our revised forecast of $16 billion, not the $18 billion that we originally forecast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have stronger growth and a better outcome despite poor commodity prices. That is because a lot of things are going well for us in the diversification of our exports. Tremendous results are being achieved by this nation in the area of manufactured exports and exports of services. In comparison with most other countries, we are seeing the volume of these exports growing at quite exceptional rates by any standard. Since 1985-86 manufactured export volumes have grown by 13 per cent and services have grown by nine per cent. In 1993-94 they are growing by 15 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at increasing rates of exports of manufactured goods and services. We are becoming increasingly less reliant on commodities. This is very good for us. Although commodities will always be very important to us, given our natural resources, we need to diversify because the long-term terms of trade of commodities is adverse. We therefore have to get more of our exports into the cycle of goods which maintain comparability and price with our imports. That is what we are doing in spades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the mid-1980s commodities have dropped from 80 per cent to 65 per cent of our total exports. This is due to diversification. It is picking up pace. It is not dropping off; it is going faster. It is going faster because we have international competitiveness, low inflation, strong productivity growth and low unit labour costs and the capacity for our manufacturers to face up to international competition and to improve their exports. In the face of declining tariffs, the manufacturing industry is more confident now than at any time in the last 30 years. That is a product of its capacity to restructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this gives me great confidence for the future of this country. I think the Australian economy is as well placed as it has ever been for a period of strong, sustained economic and employment growth, and it has the capacity year after year to knock those unemployment levels down to something which we can all feel is more tolerable. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), stated earlier, the bond markets have reacted. They know what will happen. Interest rates will go up. The government has been warned by the Reserve Bank to be careful and to take measures, but the Treasurer is saying that interest rates will not go up. All they can say to the Australian people is `Don't worry. Trust us. We know what we are doing.' I believe the Australian people have finally woken up. </PARA>

We're reducing the economic indicators.' It does not matter. They are still miles too high to gain the benefits that this economy is supposed to be getting and that both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister are telling us about today.

The Treasurer and the Prime Minister, and all the members on the government side, can say to us and the Australian people as much as they like, `Don't worry; trust us,' but indicators show that they are not managing this economy properly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These measures to change the nature of the family reunion program emphasising youth and skills, taken in an independent category, have occasioned a major change in the intake to the point where most analysis shows that the actual skills level is above that of the Australian population. However, at the same time, we have to ensure that English literacy assistance goes to those Australians who are unemployed after decades of productive work in occupations where English skills were not necessarily essential or actively encouraged. That has been a focus of the government, particularly over the last two to three years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures specifically relating to citizens from non-English speaking backgrounds will be of some assistance in my electorate. Reid, as a site of AMES facilities, relatively cheap housing, existing non-English speaking background populations, reasonable public transport and DIEA units, receives many new arrivals. Teachers and principals have recently raised the particular problem of ESL pupils being established in their classes for six months and then, after a struggle to assist, moving from the DIEA flats to other areas. The teachers are then forced to start again. One group of pupils was dislocated at an early stage. Teachers had to go through the disheartening process of trying to help another group with very few language skills whilst at the same time keeping to the curriculum with the rest of the class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, it has been queried whether disadvantaged school programs necessarily fully compensate for the strains on already underprivileged schools by being the nurturing grounds for large numbers of students lacking elementary English skills. I note in comparative US situations demands and threatened legal action by Florida and California against the US administration because of the undue burden on their states occasioned by unauthorised migration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are positive initiatives in this budget. The total program to help the survivors of torture and trauma receives a healthy increase. Advocates will aid people such as the Bosnian victims by accompanying them to services, explaining their problems and aiding them to locate the required help. After January 1995, those people who have become permanent residents through the humanitarian program will not have to live in Australia for a set period to obtain the aged pension or disability and sole parent pensions. We speak here of people who for all intents and purposes are the equivalent of refugees. Seven thousand people who have typically suffered extreme hardship and the threat of death are helped by this change in the next financial year. The recognition that these residents had limited options should continue to be accompanied by strenuous restrictions on easy access for other permanent residence categories. In contrast, they freely select Australia, with its advantageous social welfare provisions, over other lands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also endorse the government's expenditure for a campaign to promote citizenship and the additional moneys that will fund 25 additional grants in aid. I am well aware of the tremendous effort current recipient groups undertake in my electorate for settlement needs. The migration agents registration requirements have put a particular stress on those few with accredited employees. A particular thrust would be to help the labour marketability of new arrivals through ensuring access to training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently held discussions with the National Immigration Forum. One of its many legitimate concerns was the non-availability of a designated and funded group to assist humanitarian non-refugee claimants. I note that, within the $2 million for an extra 40 grants, specific provision is made for the settlement needs of these groupings. I well understand that this does not necessarily cover advocacy requirements, but it does indicate government recognition of their situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has committed itself to maintenance of the literacy component within the workplace English language and literacy provisions at nearly $8 million. This is a facet of a broader agenda that in recent years has guaranteed more help for long-term residents who worked in often arduous industries for decades, surviving without extensive English. In 1994 they are gravely threatened by the changing nature of the work force and industry itself. Those retrenched have difficulties competing in a buyers' labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity to express disquiet at an unexpected outcome of AMES changes. We appreciate the government's introduction of a 510-hour guarantee and widespread exemptions from payments. Unfortunately, this has been accompanied by a requirement that employees unable to complete their courses in one year because of work commitments should have to pay an annual fee&mdash;in other words, pay for a second year if they have not completed the course in the first year. This should be reviewed. English as a second language training within the special intervention program for unemployed people will be doubled to 22,000 starts by 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I welcome the opportunities opened up by the white paper regarding the new enterprise incentive scheme expansion and permission for such organisations as migrant resource centres to tender as NEIS managing agents. DEET advisory committees will increase options for consultation with migrant groupings. There will be a network of 50 DEET liaison officers to ensure advances in service delivery to migrants. The dramatic presence of regional employment disparities was highlighted by the Kelty development task force. Some suggestions have been mirrored in the white paper. Working Nation states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities Australians have to work and to prosper are, in large part, determined by the economic prosperity of their local area. . . The better (business, government, unions and community) interact, the more likely it is that economic and social objectives will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst objectives in this government assault on unemployment is the effort to lessen capital problems for small and medium enterprises by reducing the concessional tax rate for pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in such firms. This will possibly sponsor regional development. Some restrictions on PDFs will be relaxed to encourage take-up, particularly by superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, for infrastructure bonds the government proposes a 33 per cent optional tax rebate as an alternative to non-assessible income. Bonds can now be utilised for aviation facilities, electricity transmission and water infrastructure. Importantly, disposal of any infrastructure construction will be permitted within the 25-year period if the proposed purchaser is sufficiently commercial. The existing maximum period of 10 years for the tax concession will significantly rise to 15 per cent. All of these measures are relevant to chronic unemployment black spots such as Sydney's Auburn municipality and the Granville ward of the Parramatta council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an article headed `Enterprise Zones Will Not Work' by Phillip Kasinitz and Jan Rosenberg in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">City Journal</EMPHASIS> of autumn 1993. Admittedly, this was limited in its coverage to a particular initiative: tax breaks for private employers to situate their jobs in depressed US areas. The article systematically delineated practices in Red Hook, Brooklyn. After summarising the failures, it concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in a loose labour market it is easier and more efficient for employers to find new employees through informal referral systems, particularly when local residents are perceived as unreliable and prone to crime. The idea of enterprise zones reflects a basic misunderstanding of the relationship between living space and working space.</PARA>
<PARA>I congratulate this government on changes to PDFs and infrastructure bonds and the labour market improvements which should interface with the 60 area consultative committees. As noted, the latter can become positive boosters of the jobs compact. What has to be monitored with tremendous vigilance is the nature of these committees and the utilisation of the regional strategies infrastructure. Depending upon the interest of other levels of government, as much as $150 million could be allocated to these areas by 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous local government works program was noble in sentiment and entailed a welcome equity provision in its allocation of nearly $350 million to municipalities of higher unemployment. It aided urban renewal, public facilities, and roads, water and sewerage allocation. They often encompassed recreational and tourist projects. Unfortunately, whilst going in the right direction, the bands receiving assistance were too wide and tied to per capita criteria rather than to unemployment levels alone. Narrower groupings of especially deprived councils should have received greater help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More seriously, the case of the use by the rather notorious Parramatta council again involved a geographic distortion that owed more to electorate boundaries and less to analysis of depressed areas. It is noteworthy that the main project was an adjunct to the Riverside Theatre, which provides as much public information about its finances as Coca-Cola does about its formula. The Commonwealth parliament cannot surrender oversight on the false assumption that, because federal ministers and public servants are at arms length, political distortions do not emerge. These committees and these financial incentives must be cemented in a very real analysis of the specific skills disparities and unemployment levels within councils and regions so as not to allow the edifice complex to reign supreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on page 19 of the summary paper advocacy of `the formation of regional economic groupings and increasing their ability to function effectually'. In the report itself, at page 164, there are promises of `assistance to regions to establish a representative regional wide development organisation. In many cases existing regional organisations will meet the criteria.' Laudable sentiments, I am sure, but we must guard to ensure that the embryonic bureaucracies of larger councils with their backslapping relationships with chambers of commerce do not ipso facto predominate over smaller councils with more pressing demands who lack those resources. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) I wish to address one of the most important issues facing the resources sector in this country today, namely, Australia's policy stance on the greenhouse effect. When I say `Australia's policy stance on the greenhouse effect', it is really the government's lack of a credible stance I am referring to. In its eagerness to get the budget out, the government overlooked important developments in the greenhouse agenda. If the government's current inattention continues, this debacle will be remembered for far longer and have more impact than this budget ever will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entire greenhouse debate is marked by confusion. It is my aim to put some clarity into this debate today. The greenhouse effect is a phenomenon in which some of the solar energy reflected from the earth's surface is absorbed by the atmosphere rather than being lost to space. As a result, the temperature of the atmosphere may rise. The enhanced greenhouse effect refers to human activity in industrial processes giving rise to greenhouse gases. The so-called greenhouse gases are those which allow the atmosphere to heat up in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal scientific debate relates to the amount of these gases required for the temperature of the atmosphere to rise significantly. The commonest greenhouse gas, and the most easily produced by industrial processes, is carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring gas which makes up a significant proportion of the earth's atmosphere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I will not buy into the scientific debate over whether the greenhouse effect is as serious as some commentators have suggested. I will merely call in passing for some more balance in the debate, and for both sides to give each other a respected hearing. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, in its report released earlier this week entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Greenhouse response: effectiveness of the implementation of an interim program</EMPHASIS>, noted that there has been a warming of the Earth's surface consistent with the increase in concentration of greenhouse gases, but it remains to be established whether the warming can be attributed to the enhanced greenhouse effect. That very good report goes on to say that it is clear that if this change in temperature continues to grow in magnitude it could have serious implications for the earth's climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what has the Australian government done about greenhouse? The answer is not much, and certainly not enough particularly when the opportunities that exist are considered. In August 1990 the government announced the creation of nine sectoral working groups to examine ecologically sustainable development, which included the examination of greenhouse issues. While these nine groups were significant in bringing together disparate views and finding common ground, no-one involved would deny that the momentum generated then has largely been allowed to dissipate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990, the Commonwealth adopted an interim planning target for the reduction of greenhouse gases. This target involves stabilising the emission of these gases at 1998 levels by the year 2000, and then reducing emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005. This target was subject to the most important caveat that Australia would not proceed with the adoption of measures which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or would affect Australia's trade competitiveness, particularly in the absence of similar action by other major greenhouse gas producing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no misunderstanding, greenhouse is not just an environmental issue; it is a very real economic and trade issue, particularly for Australia. At the same time as the interim planning target was announced, the need for a nationally coordinated approach was accepted and the government began working towards a national greenhouse response strategy. As part of a holding approach while the strategy was developed, a number of measures were identified which were to both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and result in cost savings. Then in June 1992 the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was signed by 154 countries, including Australia. The convention's objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to achieve stabilisation for greenhouse gas emissions at a level that would prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.</PARA>
<PARA>This objective is to be met through a range of measures including research and development, education, and information programs. An unofficial target of the convention has been that countries should stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. Australia has ratified the convention and, following ratification by the 50th country, the convention recently entered into force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meeting of the parties to the convention will be held in March 1995 in Berlin. This will be the first meeting of the permanent body which will drive the convention's objectives and activities in the future. Closer to home, the national greenhouse strategy was released by the Australian government in December 1992. It is the vehicle by which Australia will meet its international obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goals of this domestic strategy include: to contribute towards effective global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to improve knowledge and understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect, and to prepare for potential impacts of climate change in Australia. The five areas for priority action are: the preparation of a national greenhouse gas inventory to facilitate monitoring and evaluation of the progress of the strategy, community involvement, the establishment of a national greenhouse advisory panel, measures to address greenhouse gas emissions in the production and use of energy, and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strategy is being implemented in phases. During the first phase particular attention is being given to energy production, distribution and use. This is entirely reasonable as there are many initiatives which can be adopted which not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but save money as well. For instance, replacement of electric motors with more energy efficient motors will save a business money through decreased electricity consumption, which also reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the plant supplying the electricity&mdash;plain commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has correctly identified a number of measures as a first step which can establish a framework for proposals for further reductions in greenhouse gases to be considered at an international level. These initial actions emphasise an integrated least cost approach to energy planning; energy pricing adjustments which better reflect economic, social and environmental costs; the promotion of greater use of co-generation schemes; minimum energy performance standards for appliances and equipment; fuel efficiency improvement in new motor vehicles; provision of information for energy users; and research and development in relation to energy efficiency, energy demand reduction, renewable energy systems and reduction of adverse environmental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is all very worth while, in particular with regard to co-generation. I was very pleased to see the progress recently in the east of my electorate of Gippsland, at Orbost, of a significant co-generation facility proposal to burn wood waste, generate electricity, and kiln dry hardwoods for furniture and structural uses. This is certainly the way of the future, and I commend honourable members seeking to encourage regional development to examine the progress of this outstanding operation in East Gippsland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To summarise, over recent years the government has been working on a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia while committing Australia to even tighter targets and schedules in the international arena. Unfortunately, both of these elements of the government's approach appear to be doomed to failure. Sadly, the government has failed to put in place effective energy management programs which would help Australia meet the various targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993 the Australian National Audit Office reported that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had not taken sufficient action to implement the package of greenhouse initiatives announced in October 1990, despite the sense of urgency intended by the government. The audit office also found that, by the end of 1992, the complete framework for making energy savings in the government's own operation was still being put into place. It also found that the significant use of energy in manufacturing had been relatively neglected and that there was scope to expand greatly the understanding of energy efficiency in other sectors.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report by independent consultants at about the same time as the Auditor-General's investigation queried the effectiveness and relevance of the government's programs. The House of Representatives committee report on greenhouse, which I referred to earlier and which was presented in this parliament one or two days ago, found that one year on from that Auditor-General's report of May 1993 little, if anything, had changed. That committee's report highlighted the government's failure to provide anything like the staffing or funding necessary for effective programs. The failure of this strategy will compound undeniably the reluctance by business to adopt new and more energy efficient technologies. Yet this is a key plank of the government's high profile campaign to reduce greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are the most basic. They are often called `no regrets' measures because they result in cost savings as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, these measures are not enough to meet Australia's greenhouse reduction commitments by themselves. Even if they are adopted without qualification, they will allow just half of the 20 per cent reduction target to be met. It is very clear from discussions with industry that far more work has been done on addressing the implications of meeting that second 10 per cent reduction than has been done by the government to meet its first 10 per cent reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government has crashed at the first hurdle in regard to greenhouse.

As a start, it is imperative that the federal government demonstrate leadership on the issue and overhaul its own energy management programs. The second plank of the government's strategy on greenhouse is the international agreements that I have already touched on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister interjects that it happens in the UK and New Zealand. Of course you would put that argument because you are always wanting to follow the leader on the international stage. How about we make our own decisions about what is in our own interests. As a result of the government's abrogation of its responsibility in so many international conventions and treaties, you can rightly fear that the government will commit Australia to a reduction in greenhouse gases that will damage our trade competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real danger that Australia, in an effort to appear greener than green, will agree to greenhouse reduction targets that will severely damage our competitiveness. This is particularly so if a per capita decrease in greenhouse gases is agreed to. Australia has a high per capita greenhouse gas emission because of the availability of cheap fuel and enormous mineral resources. The combination has meant that Australia has naturally developed a high reliance on resources and energy intensive industries. These industries contribute crucially to our present standard of living and to our future prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreement to a percentage cut in greenhouse gas emissions would hit Australia's industries hardest because of our dependence on energy. Our trade competitors would reap the benefits while we do business with one hand tied behind our backs. In order to meet the UN convention target of stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels in the year 2000, the United States would require only a seven per cent reduction in emissions while Australia would have to undergo a massive 24 per cent reduction. It is also important to remember that countries that import our coal would be subject to the same reductions. This could be a disaster for our industrial backbone, particularly when you consider that, despite our high per capita emissions, Australia contributes only one per cent of global greenhouse gases. It is vitally important that the government not compromise our national interest by agreeing to measures which affect Australian industry more than our trade competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must take a strong position to the next greenhouse meeting in Berlin in March of next year. The government must be prepared to stand by its prepared position and not accept a compromise which damages our international competitiveness. The delegation to Berlin must be firmly aware of the economic consequences of trying to be greener than the rest of the world. It must recognise that climate change is as much a trade and competitiveness issue as an environmental issue. I think the comments of Senator Gareth Evans in recent weeks show how embryonic the government's thinking is on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough that cabinet has yet to determine its position on this issue, as Senator Gareth Evans recently admitted in the press. Unfortunately, the government has let the issue slip while the budget was prepared, but it must focus on it now. Now is the time that the government should be taking its position to like-minded countries and developing alliances which will carry real weight in Berlin. The government must also address the shameful neglect of domestic energy management which has caused its commitment on the entire greenhouse issue to be called into question. If it is left until cabinet turns its mind to it after the budget, I fear that it will be far too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important issue which occupies a great deal of time and effort by individual members, but I do not see the commitment to reducing greenhouse gases being translated from generalised rhetoric and platitudes into concrete action. We have already had an Auditor-General's report slamming the government for its inaction and its failure of leadership. Twelve months later, that has been repeated by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts.

<PARA>What did industry think of these views? The President of Ford Australia, John Ogden, was reported as saying that the then shadow Treasurer, the current Leader of the Opposition, was talking `absolute farcical nonsense that defied description'. Mr Ogden specifically denied the assertion that Ford's main concerns were the inflexible labour market, restrictive work practices and low productivity, and not the opposition's destructive tariff policy. In this regard, I refer to a report by Tom Connors in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 17 July 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rise of the current Leader of the Opposition has been attributed not only to the treachery against the honourable member for Wentworth but also to support from the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, and his so-called pragmatic political philosophy. The Fraser government's desperation for power was unquestionable; we all know that. But in clinging to power it was paralysed by a gridlock of vested interests. Tax rorts, financial deregulation, tariff reform and a sensible approach to workplace relations were only a few of the issues the Fraser government avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dismal statistics of the Fraser government's performance on economic growth, inflation, unemployment, international debt and industrial disputation are well known, but it is worth recalling the figures on industrial research and development. Under the Fraser government business expenditure on research and development fell from around 0.4 per cent of GDP to around 0.25 per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies pursued by this government have reversed the Fraser government's destruction of Australia's industrial research and development capacity. This year's science and technology statement produced by the Department of Industry, Science and Technology shows that over the last 10 years Australia experienced the fastest rate of growth in external patent applications in the OECD, and one of the fastest rates of growth in business expenditure on R&amp;D. Australia's expenditure on research and development by government agencies and universities, at 0.79 per cent, is well above the OECD average of 0.62 per cent. But business expenditure of 0.57 per cent remains well below the one to two per cent range of major industrialised nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this month I called on the opposition to address the very serious matter of a shadow minister for science denigrating Australia's capabilities. I am delighted that the current Leader of the Opposition has so promptly moved the honourable member for Goldstein on to other duties. I have no doubt that, in so doing, he acted on advice from Liberal premiers, who were horrified by the damage to their efforts to promote investment in Australia caused by the shallow, politically motivated comments of the honourable member for Goldstein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am still not happy with the opposition's approach to science and technology. In view of the pressing need to boost industrial research and development, and to link public sector science to industry, it sends all the wrong messages about bundling science and technology into the education portfolio. The last time we had a minister for education, science and technology was back in the 1960s when Malcolm Fraser held that position. Now we have another example of how it will happen in this portfolio: Malcolm Fraser's hand is now in science, technology and education. This will have been an unfortunate side-effect of youthful experimentation by the current Leader of the Opposition. This is a flashback to the 1960s by the current Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, for all his faults, the honourable member for Goldstein has the capacity to quote and quote well. One of his favourite quotes is from Michael Porter, an influential Harvard academic, who has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overarching principle in addressing science and technology should be to create an innovation policy and not just a science and technology policy. Science and technology cannot be decoupled from its commercial application in seeking to enhance national advantage.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a perfectly logical statement. But, of course, Professor Porter is quite correct, and that is why the opposition must immediately decouple science and technology from education where its commercial application will be swamped politically by the persuasive voices of a thousand and more sincere, hard-working and underfunded academics. The challenge for Australia is to continue to grow our industrial research and development base. That is why the government, in the white paper entitled Working Nation, places priority on supporting innovation. There should be bipartisan support for this policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is committed to increasing the number of firms undertaking research and development in Australia&mdash;small firms as well as large in the service and resources sector as well as in manufacturing. To this end, the eligibility requirements for the 150 per cent tax concession for R&amp;D have been eased, allowing greater access for small and medium sized enterprises. Honourable members will recall the notorious Fightback policy was to reduce loss of revenue via the R&amp;D tax concession by eliminating so-called tax rorts. What hope would small businesses have in claiming the tax concession for R&amp;D under a coalition government? They would be swamped with paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Working Nation the government has also introduced a new support scheme for specific early commercialisation in small high-technology firms. The government will develop a national technology diffusion and access network to enhance the links between business, science agencies and research and technology centres. Existing centres, such as the Queensland Manufacturing Institute in Brisbane and the South Australian Centre for Manufacturing, provide the model for new centres. Close links between our first-rate science base and our industry are critical to Australia's economic future. The government will be establishing a further 10 cooperative research centres later this year and has increased the base level of training and funding of the national science agencies. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has established a research group in Karratha, Western Australia. This will enhance national and international profile of aims in the field of tropical reef research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former opposition spokesman on science and technology, the honourable member for Goldstein, made a number of ill-informed statements about the government's support for CSIRO in the white paper and the budget. It is important that the misconceptions spread by the honourable member for Goldstein be firmly and comprehensibly rebutted. Recent government measures and CSIRO's own initiatives will ensure that the organisation continues to deliver excellent returns on investment by business and the Australian community. The increase in the base level of funding will enable a number of priority projects to begin or continue in the coming triennium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, CSIRO will spend $10 million during this period to improve the access of small and medium sized enterprises to CSIRO technology and expertise. It will adopt a targeted approach to small and medium sized enterprises, establishing outreach groups throughout the organisation. It will increase the emphasis on secondments to and from industry. In this way, CSIRO hopes to double interaction with small and medium sized enterprises over the next five years. As well, CSIRO will be allocating some $7 million over the next three years to improve companies' access to-state-of-the-art or `smart' manufacturing technology and enhance their market responsiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A more outward looking CSIRO will also boost its support for Australian companies in their efforts to tap into export markets. Over the triennium, CSIRO will continue to shift resources in response to national research priorities. CSIRO will increase its internal funding for research in minerals, manufacturing and the information and communications industries. Internal funding for environmental research will be maintained at about its present level. Rural research continues to rate highly. About 40 per cent of CSIRO's total research effort is devoted to this area. Current restructuring proposals aim to place the organisation in the best possible position to support the changing needs of its stakeholders in the animal, food and fibre industries over the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the triennium beginning with the financial year 1994-95, CSIRO will continue to receive appropriation funding averaging some $438 million per year in current prices. So the government is retaining the 30 per cent external earnings target for CSIRO. External earnings ranging from $220 million to $226 million per year are expected from CSIRO over the next three years. The significant amount of funding from these external sources reflects the strong links which continue to develop between CSIRO and the end users of research. I am glad to say that CSIRO will be in an improved position to attract external funding as a result of measures announced in the industry statement, Working Nation. For example, the lowering of the threshold for the 150 per cent tax concession will provide a greater incentive for small to medium sized enterprises to invest in R&amp;D; changes to syndicated R&amp;D arrangements should have the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts speak for themselves. CSIRO's important role has been maintained and enhanced by the government. The industry, science and technology policies of this government, set out in the white paper, Working Nation, and funded through the appropriation bills, signal a new phase in the government's approach to industry policy. This phase is about changing the emphasis from the adjustment policies of the 1980s to the post-tariff reform needs of the 1990s and beyond. It is also about removing impediments to industry, investment, productivity and innovation. We now have an industry policy that builds on the success of recent trade negotiations and the earlier work to restructure the Australian economy. Working Nation provides a stable framework for business to plan new investment and increase employment. I commend the expenditures, to implement the government's industry, science and technology policies, to the House. </PARA>

This is an additional amount of $830.8 million, which is up 2.9 per cent on the previous year and is $1 billion above the estimate last year. I think this is where we have to start to look at the government's credentials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), gave an animated speech about what the government is doing in a particular area of its budget. But the overall trend, not the specifics, of where the country is going is fundamental. What we notice about this government's policy in economic terms is that we are increasingly running into debt. That is not by my standards or the coalition's standards, but by the government's standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely fascinating to go back and have a look at what the government said in 1992 in regard to its One Nation package. When we have a look at its 1992 package we find that it set very clear standards that had to be achieved. The government said at that stage that it would only be economically responsible if the 1994-95 budget debt came in under $1 billion. That was only two years ago in February 1992. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) then said that the government would be economically responsible only if this nation brought in a budget deficit of less than $1 billion. In other words, its expenditure over receipts should be less than $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have in this budget? On the government's own figures, we have overspent by $11.7 billion. The opposition did not set this standard; the government did. The great tragedy for this country of ours is that the government continues to borrow money mainly from overseas to sustain its spending, and it spends more than it receives year after year. If we as a country are going to do that, one day somebody will have to find the money to pay it back. But this government appears to be ignorant of those simple straightforward facts. This budget can be likened to any family that earns $30,000 and spends $33,000. In other words, it overspends by 10 per cent. The government can set standards. It claims to be a master at setting standards. But the real test for any government in Australia is whether it can achieve the standards that it sets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also said in its One Nation statement that in 1995-96 we would have a $2 billion budget surplus. What does the budget show us this year? The government brought in projected figures of $9.8 billion. In other words, the government was $12,000 million out. Either the government was telling us untruths in 1992 when it said that it was fiscally responsible to bring down a budget with a surplus of $2 billion or it is telling us untruths now. I think any objective observer of this would know that what we are being told now is totally irresponsible. The government knows it and it is doing it obviously with an eye and mind to the future political opportunities which it thought it might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why believe in this government? That is the big question which all Australians should ask. The government set the standards back in 1992. It claimed they would be responsible standards. In this budget we see the government falling far short of its own standards, not just by a few hundred million dollars but, literally, by billions of dollars. So, in a financial sense, Australians cannot believe this government; nor should they ever believe the Labor Party when it talks about the economic management of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the greatest indicators of the total irresponsibility of the Labor Party in managing the economic affairs of Australia is to go back and look at our overseas debt from 1901. In the first 83 years since Federation, Australia built up a gross debt of around $35,000 million. Eleven years later that figure stands at approximately $220,000 million. In other words, in 83 years it increased by $35,000 million and in the last 11 years under Labor&mdash;just listen to the figures&mdash;it increased by $185,000 million. That is the record of mismanagement of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaker after speaker for the government will come in here and try to tell the Australian people that there are marvellous programs under way in this budget. On paper that might be true, but the reality is that Australia is continually borrowing from other people's savings to a point where it is going to create great difficulty for this country to repay. It will not be this generation which meets the repayments on the debts being incurred. Our children and our grandchildren will be responsible for the debts incurred by this Labor Party over the last 11 years&mdash;literally thousands of millions of dollars. It will be on their heads and around their necks for probably 10 to 15 years at least. Government members might come in here and talk about the marvellous programs, but they are not funding them out of the capacity of this nation's wealth at this stage.

Thousands and thousands of Australians were thrown on to the dole queues and now the government will make them highly trained unemployed people. At the end of the day, I suspect and firmly believe that the unemployment queues will not be all that much shorter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just go into what the budget says. It is really a charade. The paper projects 98,500 new places in 1993-94, rising to 148,500 in 1995-96. An analysis of the actual situation reveals a very different outcome. In 1993-94, a target of 46,000 apprenticeships is less than the target that we had in 1992-93. In actual fact, we are going backwards, not forwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in 1995-96, the target of 60,000 new apprenticeships will not have returned to the levels of four years ago. The government claims to do something for the unemployed, but in actual fact the target figures are not as high as they were four years ago. Let us look at traineeships. The target of 34,000 new trainees in 1995-96&mdash;double the current target&mdash;is unrealistic. Why do I say that? I say it because of experience. Again we find that this government sets itself targets but rarely if ever does it achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate. Since its inception, the Australian traineeship system has achieved only 68 per cent of the targeted number. So, even though the government says it is going to target 34,000 new trainees in 1995-96, which is double the current target, I wonder how many will really be achieved? It is all very well for the government to come in here and try to lead the Australian people to believe that there will be a massive increase in opportunities for employment and work because our young people and the people out there on the dole queues are going to be trained and therefore will get a job; the history of this government in this area and in many other areas is that it fails to deliver. I have no hesitation in saying that it will fail to deliver again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1985 to 1993, of the 80,000 students who commenced traineeships, 24,000 dropped out&mdash;a 30 per cent drop-out rate. The traineeships include career start traineeships. In 1992-93, 3,000 career start traineeships were targeted. Have a guess as to how many actually commenced. This is 1992-93&mdash;we are not going very far back into history&mdash;and how many were commenced? The answer is 373, about 11 per cent. Eleven per cent of the targeted figure actually commenced. I wonder how many people ended up completing their traineeships. It was probably less than five per cent of what was hoped for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about prevocational places? Let us look at the government's record there. The target was 10,000 places for 1993-94 and 1994-95 and 15,000 places for 1995-96. That is less than the 18,000 places provided in 1992-93. So we have 10,000 and 15,000 places respectively in the years coming up, less than the government had targeted for 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Australian Public Service trainees. The white paper projects 1,500 places in 1993-94 and 2,000 in 1994-95. That is less than the 2,151 places in 1992-93. The traineeships in all the areas I have mentioned are an absolute charade on the Australian people. It is absolutely disgraceful for government members, particularly the Prime Minister, to come into this place and argue the case for people who are desperately lonely out there, people with families who are unable to make ends meet. The government holds out this carrot to them as if it is going to give them something marvellous, yet it is less than the government has offered before. Even the targets the government had before were never met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a tremendous number of disappointed people out there, unfortunately. I only wish the government could achieve its objectives. I only wish it had achieved its objectives in previous years. The government cannot be trusted to achieve its financial targets. It cannot be trusted to achieve its training targets for the million or so unemployed people out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is the case with industrial relations. We have just had a new industrial relations bill come into this parliament. It was supposed to be the new, you-beaut industrial relations package for this country, which would help lift us out of our malaise. What do we see within two months? We see the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) come into this place and do a total U-turn on some of the fundamentals of that package because the government did not get it right. The minister maintained that this was the industrial relations act of all acts, yet within two months we see the government again fail to deliver on its rhetoric, on its promises to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is certainly the biggest social problem Australia faces. The government has done very little to bring about any solution to unemployment in this country. In 1983&mdash;the government is always very keen to go back to the past, it would appear in recent debates; it seems to be becoming a government of the past, not looking to the future very often&mdash;there were 624,900 unemployed. How many unemployed are there in 1993? There are 940,500. What about the long-term unemployed, the people who are out there doing it hard and tough? In 1983 there were 127,000 and in 1993 there are 336,000, a 300 per cent increase. Not only is the number of long-term unemployed much higher than under a previous coalition government but the time they spend unemployed is also much higher. The duration of unemployment in 1983 was only 15 weeks. It is now dragged out to just over 27 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the record of the Labor government. In the last 11 years this government has for the first time in certainly 60 or 70 years created a new underclass. As we heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), say in the MPI today, certainly we are not going to see&mdash;as the Prime Minister said&mdash;a class of working poor; they are unemployed poor, created by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we find now emerging in this great nation of ours an underclass of people who are unemployed for a long period without the capacity to get back in and have a slice of the action. The government cannot be trusted in financial matters. It cannot meet its objectives. It cannot be trusted in the training promises it has given to the Australian people. It cannot be trusted in its industrial relations promises. We see that here and now, this day, this week. It cannot be trusted to bring down unemployment with the promises which it has given. Not only that, it cannot be trusted in regard to its rhetoric on families. It talks about diversity in families but it is really encouraging the disintegration of families. That is the nature of this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Many people would appreciate that the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have shouldered a very heavy burden in managing the white paper process and producing a budget in May instead of August. My congratulations go to them for a fine effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is predicated on growth and will certainly produce a framework for job creation and a reduction in unemployment. As the Treasurer so succinctly pointed out on the first page of his budget speech, this budget will maximise growth, reduce unemployment, promote social justice and reduce the budget deficit without increasing taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just comment on the social justice agenda of this government which has been addressed in the budget. I pay tribute to those ministers in the social portfolios that have given expression and effect to the strong social justice agenda that is pursued by this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some in the community, particularly those on the opposition side, who doubt the economic basis on which the growth and investment projections have been made in the budget. We ought to compare the economic base that we have today with that which existed in 1982-83. We should recall that after that period we had six years of growth and sustained job creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With our current economic position, we are really poised for growth. Unemployment has fallen from its peak. It is now 10.3 per cent. More than 230,000 jobs have been created since April last year. Interest rates on bank lending are the lowest since the 1970s. Inflation is at its lowest level for three decades and, of course, inflationary expectations are quite low. Business confidence is high. Consumer confidence is the highest it has been for 10 years. We have had dramatic increases in productivity within the Australian economy. Our international competitiveness has improved by some 30 per cent. The time lost in industrial disputation in 1993 was the lowest for 30 years. The economic growth rate on which the job creation intentions of this government are based has in 1993 been some four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at some of those economic variables in 1982-83, we will see a very different picture. But, despite the adverse economic variables at that particular point in our economic history, we still managed to grow on average by around four per cent and the Australian economy engaged itself in substantial job creation. The government has simply said, `We did it from 1982-83; for the six years after that. We can certainly do it again.' At that time unemployment stood at 10 per cent, inflation was double digit, interest rates were very high&mdash;in double figures&mdash;business confidence and consumer confidence were low, the Australian economy was racked with industrial disputation and jobs were being shed at a rate that had not occurred for decades. That was the legacy of the opposition. The opposition, as we well know, rewards those who held economic portfolios in the past and who failed. I will speak a little bit about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian economy is positioned on a platform which will certainly encourage economic growth. There has been debate in this chamber about the investment projections that are contained in the budget. But, of course, that is not the general community. If we look at the business community, it certainly supports the projections that the government has enunciated in this budget. Just two days ago the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper business council said that the government's forecasts were not an impossibility. The managing director of AMP said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe the 14.5 per cent level of business investment is well within reach.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Australia Bank's projection for business investment is marginally higher than the government's. BHP's forecasts of business investment show growth of up to 15 per cent. These are people out in the economy, out in the marketplace. If they can provide projections that are roughly in line with that which the government has determined in the budget, then that is okay by me. Investment expenditure really is the key to sustained economic growth to the end of the decade. In recent times it has certainly been subdued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer members of the opposition to the submission made by the MTIA to the recently completed government purchasing inquiry on which I sat. In its evidence it gave a very good analysis of why that investment had been slow and uneven. As we all know, the Australian economy has the capacity to accommodate higher production without a rise in investment. Productivity increases can be accommodated within the Australian economy without additional investments at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people are saying that the recovery in profit levels should be driving higher levels of business investment. That may be so for some companies, but it is important to appreciate that the improved profitability levels for some enterprises are driven by debt and cost reductions. But, once the balance sheets are repaired in these enterprises and profitability levels come from increased sales expenditures on the goods and services produced by those firms, we will certainly see an improvement in investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most interesting analysis the MTIA provided related to the globalisation of world trade and the emergence of new producers and markets. It indicated that this had certainly complicated the investment environment. Overseas parent companies are demanding higher rates of return on investments in Australia and have expanded options to place their investment around the world. So it was not simply a case that the overseas parent would choose to invest in Australia and stimulate the investment recovery in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly do have a good investment platform at the moment with low interest rates, high consumer confidence, the prospect of improved demand, overall returning company profitability and the incentives that government has provided. Through this budget and other measures, I think we can confidently say the 14.5 per cent investment projection is likely to be understated. I refer the House to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Composition of Trade, Australia</EMPHASIS>, which indicates that imports of capital equipment are surging. It suggests that substantial investments are already under way in the small and medium business sector which are not picked up in the national account figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am more than pleased not only with the general thrust of the budget and the white paper but also with the specific initiatives that will support working families in the Corio electorate in this International Year of the Family. Certainly, job creation in the region will flow from improved growth, and this will open up new opportunities for unemployed families in my electorate. The expansion of labour market programs, especially the job compact, will provide unemployed workers with a better opportunity to enter the job market by improving their skills and to take advantage of these new opportunities. The parenting allowance for the unemployed and low income earners will provide families in the Geelong area with a much needed boost to their disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a raft of other budget measures that will impact on the people of Geelong in a most positive and advantageous way. I refer to the initiatives that we have taken in the area of breast cancer research. The women of Geelong will certainly benefit by that initiative. Some $209 million over four years will be provided for a national breast cancer program. Last year I had the pleasure of opening a breast screening facility in Geelong with the Prime Minister's wife. It was well attended by people from the health field and by women in Geelong who have an interest in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget also provides some $62.7 million over four years to assist the homeless. Geelong is no different from other large provincial cities around Australia. It has a problem with homelessness, especially among some youth. Those measures will enhance accommodation assistance and will improve community support services to the homeless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to say that in this budget there are special initiatives for veterans. My electorate consists of a large population of World War II veterans and Vietnam veterans. I have had quite close contact with the Vietnam veterans during my first year as a member of this parliament. I am hopeful that we can tap into the $20 million plus that has been provided in this budget to assist with rehabilitation, early intervention and provide for those with psychiatric disabilities among the Vietnam population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already provided funds to the national mental health strategy for mental illness. The budget allocates an extra $169 million over four years to accelerate the process of mental health reform. We have an excellent mental health facility in Geelong called Dax House. I am sure that with these budget initiatives we will be able to access extra funds and expand those services to people in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important initiative in the budget is the child immunisation program which will provide vaccines for preventable diseases. An extra $9 1/2 million has been provided to promote childhood immunisation. I am sure children in Geelong will benefit greatly from this initiative. One interesting feature of the budget is the $48 million which will be provided over four years for the national Asian languages and studies program. Many Geelong schools are already heavily involved in such programs, but my task and the task of the educational community in Geelong will be to access those particular funds over the next four years and expand those initiatives in Geelong. More importantly, the initiatives in the white paper and in the budget will assist small and medium business and will really get the small business sector in Geelong humming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an overall situation, yesterday in question time the Treasurer described the sorts of measures taken by the government. He referred to the improved availability of finance&mdash;some $140 million&mdash;that had been provided by the Reserve Bank to the small and medium business sector. He referred to the expansion of the EFIC working capital facility, the introduction of the business angels concept and the assistance that will be provided to small and medium firms to access equity finance. He talked about tax initiatives, pooled development funds, initiatives taken by the government to improve awareness by entrepreneurs of Commonwealth Development Bank facilities and to improve their access to those funds. He mentioned the $100 million which will be provided over four years to NIES, the $70 million which will enhance trade networks and the increased access to government purchasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I met last week with representatives of the Geelong economic development board and held productive discussions with them. We discussed concrete initiatives that the community might pursue under the framework of the white paper and the budget. There are some very interesting initiatives that I think we can take on the ground in Geelong to give assistance to the small and medium business sector and, hopefully, through that generate some job creation. I think there is great scope for the establishment of a one-stop shop in Geelong where businesses can access government programs both at the state and federal level with greater ease. That particular suggestion was taken up with a degree of enthusiasm by members of the board. We will have discussions within the next month to firm up possibilities in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year I negotiated with the industrial supplies office for the location of an officer in Geelong. Once again, this particular suggestion was taken up with some enthusiasm by the board, and we are hopeful of making progress on that within the next four to six weeks. We discussed ways of improving the access of Geelong firms to government purchasing. We talked about the move to establish a regional pooled development fund to expand the capital base and open up access to venture capital for new innovative firms in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked about developing a better export culture in the Geelong region and strengthening the networks between firms that are already in the export field and firms that might like to enter that arena. I suggested that we ought to undertake more intensive discussions with regional banking personnel and members of the business community to iron out some of the concerns and difficulties that the business community has in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are opportunities for establishing a local business angels network, which will provide equity capital and business expertise. There are also opportunities for the further development of the services sector and its movement into the export arena and into Asia. In a general sense, there is a great opportunity for those who are unemployed to access the  expanded labour market programs. So, all in all, I think the white paper is a great package that can be accessed by regions such as Geelong. We will work very hard in cooperation with local and state agencies in the area to make sure that Geelong firms and unemployed people in Geelong certainly get access to the funds that have been so generously provided by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important at this point to reflect a little on the economic scenario if the coalition had won the last election and Fightback had been implemented. We have heard a lot from the coalition on this budget, but let us play `what ifs'. Let us have a look at what would have happened if the Australian economy were driven by the coalition and if it had produced the last two budgets. One thing is certain: we would have had a massive increase in industrial conflict in this country; we would have seen a consequent loss of national production, which would have harmed investor perceptions; our reputation as a reliable exporter would have been damaged; and we would have seen lower levels of consumer confidence. What about fiscal policy two budgets later? We would have had a massive slashing of the community sector and we would have seen increased unemployment from those actions and reduced consumer confidence would have flowed from these public sector spending cuts. A lowering of demand would have accompanied that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of talk in the last couple of days about interest rates. There is no doubt that the opposition has certainly attempted to talk up interest rates. For the last week it has done nothing else but attempt to exert through this parliament upward pressure on interest rates. Let us look at what would have happened to business investment and the level of interest rates if Fightback had been implemented. A massive increase in inflation and inflationary expectations would have been factored in by the financial markets of this country, which would be flowing in the long-term interest rates by the implementation of Fightback. Accompanying that would have been a dampening of business investment, certainly in key sectors such as motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does anybody really believe that multinationals from overseas would have invested in Australia with a zero tariff policy that would have been pursued by the coalition under Fightback?

He has not researched the detail himself. Being unashamedly political, the government has made grand announcements, claiming significant new money for Aboriginal health, breast cancer initiatives and mental health. But there are some cruel tricks; things are just not as they seem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt the sincerity of the new Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). But one has to ask: why can she not deliver the health funding increases planned by her male predecessor? Does she have the political clout of Graham Richardson, or does she suffer from being female? Does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) perhaps treat women members of parliament in the same way that he treats women journalists?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us look at the budget and Aboriginal health. Prior to the May budget, the Aboriginal community had been led to believe by the former health minister that $800 million would be made available for Aboriginal health. In the Senate on 24 March, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am utterly confident, on the word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, that that plan will be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to this pledge, the eventual budget commitment was only $500 million. What is most cruel is that even this commitment is a hoax. To make my point, I will quote directly from an Access Economics report commissioned by the Australian Medical Association:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current fad in government public relations is to re-announce old programs as if they were new ones, and to claim substantial new money spending when the real increase is rather modest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is nowhere more evident than in the area of Aboriginal health. The Government has announced a "new" phase of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy involving $499.4 million over 5 years, claiming that nearly all is new. Our analysis suggests that the increase in funding, compared with the level of spending during 1993-94, is only about $85 million over the life of the program or an average of $17 million a year.</PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal Australians did not deserve to be tricked in this cruel way. Yet they are not the only group to be deceived. The women of Australia who face a 1 in 11 chance of contracting breast cancer have been treated with similar contempt. It seems that the government has committed $236.6 million over five years for breast cancer screening, yet this figure also proves to be an illusion. I return again to the Access Economics document which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Assuming instead that 1993/94 levels of funding were to be maintained in real levels, indicative spending in the five years would be some $176 million. Therefore the effective increase in funding for the program is some $60 million or $12 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has saved its biggest tricks for medical research and, in particular, point scoring for breast cancer research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with many others, I have been part of a concerted community campaign to have the funding for breast cancer research increased. On budget night, I thought we would have a real win. The Treasurer claimed that an extra $93 million was available over four years for the National Health and Medical Research Council and that `this was expected to result' in increased funding for breast cancer research projects. This was just playing politics. Again, the women of Australia and the medical researchers who could so well make this a clever country have been let down. I again quote from the Access Economics analysis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also announced $92.8 million for Health and Medical Research, variously described as a "further" or "additional" amount. The budget facts sheets issued by the Department of Human Services and Health disclose that this "new money" has been achieved by re-announcing funding for on-going programs. Thus the $92.8 million includes funds to ". . . restore funding to the NHMRC base which was due to lapse at the end of 1994 and for additional research through the NHMRC". As in the case of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy, the suggestion that the funds were due to lapse at the end of 1994 is technically correct (in terms of forward budget commitments) but also totally meaningless. For the years commencing 1994-95, if spending on health and medical research were sustained as a proportion of total health spending at the 1993-94 rate, then the total would be some $716.5 million. The Government has committed $667.4 million. Therefore, the effective change in spending on health and medical research in the four years is a reduction of almost $50 million or $12 million per annum. On the face of it, the Government does not presently have a strong commitment to health and medical research. The steps taken to weaken NHMRC's say in the allocation of research funds has attracted wide criticism.</PARA>
<PARA>The government, in attempting to grab votes, announced in the budget the establishment of a national breast cancer centre at a cost of $16.4 million over four years. Again, the illusion was created that the government was doing something about the underfunded state of breast cancer research. Again, the reality falls far short of this illusion. </PARA>

This expenditure can only be described as putting the cart before the horse and is a grossly irresponsible move when only $1.4 million is spent annually on breast cancer research.

However, as announced in the May budget, come January 1995, any lingering commitment that Labor may have had to accessible university education will be ditched. The Labor government needs HECS revenue now rather than later.

They may earn $509 one week but nothing the next week, yet these people, regardless of the fact that they may have a low annual income, will have HECS repayments deducted from their wages every time they dare to earn $509 a week. </PARA>

Even if businesses find the confidence to invest, in spite of the tax and industrial relations regimes they are pitted against, they will still have to find the actual funds to invest. These funds will be increasingly scarce in a borrowing climate in which the government's borrowing will effectively crowd out private sector borrowing.

In 1994-95, the money flowing into the Commonwealth coffers through personal income tax will increase by 8.1 per cent. Sure, the government has not increased rates of personal tax. It does not have to. It simply waits for people to be pushed into higher tax brackets as their wages are increased in line with inflation. This is the way in which the government has managed to up its personal income tax take by 8.1 per cent. </PARA>

No tax increase is in the 1994-95 financial year? That is rubbish. In July 1994 sales tax on wine is to increase from 22 to 24 per cent. On 1 August 1994 the tax on unleaded fuel will rise by 1c a litre. On 1 August 1994 the tax on leaded fuel will rise by 2c a litre. On 1 August 1994 the excise on tobacco will rise by five per cent. On 1 February 1995 there will be a further five per cent increase in tobacco excise. Finally, the government will celebrate the close of the 1994-95 financial year with a one per cent across the board sales tax increase.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lesson No. 1 in the conjurers' manual is how to increase taxes in a financial year without mentioning these increases in the budget for that financial year.

Indirect taxes should not be confused with insignificant taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each and every sales tax increase the government is putting in place will make it just that bit more difficult for my constituents. Take the tax increase on fuel as an example. More than 50 per cent of the households in my electorate have incomes below $30,000 a year. While this may not be obvious to the Prime Minister, ensconced in the cotton wool lifestyle of the nouveau riche, people from such households rarely have the ability to purchase new cars. They are compelled to drive older cars. From 1 August they will be punished for this impertinence with a 2c per litre increase on the leaded petrol they are obliged to use. The impact of this tax on the battlers in my electorate will be profound. For instance, every time average 1983 Falcon drivers fill up after 1 August, they will pay $1.30 extra for a tank of petrol. When people are struggling to make ends meet, this tax is just one more burden which they do not need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how hard the chief conjurer and his helpers try, they cannot obscure the fact that the extra $6.1 billion they will be spending in this coming financial year has to come from somewhere. It will not be produced out of thin air. It will be acquired by more conventional means&mdash;the taxation system. No amount of fancy gesturing can obscure the fact that in 1994-95 overall tax revenue to the Commonwealth will increase by 9.7 per cent. It should be remembered that this is the largest increase for more than a decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the May budget was not so magical after all. The Prime Minister and his helpers have simply paid for the extra $6.1 billion worth of spending with an $8 billion increase in revenue. Nothing&mdash;at least under a Labor government&mdash;is ever what it seems. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the government's response to the country's ongoing unemployment tragedy. In parts of my electorate the unemployment rate has been over 16 per cent since the beginning of this year. The government's response to this tragedy has been to throw $6.5 billion at the problem and hope desperately that this gesture will disguise the fact that it has no answers to unemployment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can train the unemployed until the cows come home. This will not create one real job, which is what they so desperately need. Jobs can only come from a vital and confident business sector. Herein lies the grand illusion of this budget. The 1994 budget is a great shaking edifice built on a fantasy&mdash;the Treasurer's fantasy that business investment will rise by 14.5 per cent over the coming financial year. Will the Treasurer's fantasy materialise? Recent figures suggest it will not. Only days after the May budget, statistics were released which showed that private capital expenditure had slumped by five per cent during the March quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And the consequences if the Treasurer's fantasy does not materialise? There will not be four per cent plus economic growth. In turn, the growth dividend this government has so irresponsibly relied on to fund its spending habit will not be forthcoming. The end result will be a further increase in the foreign debt that is hanging over this country's future. This is the legacy that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will leave for Australians of tomorrow. With the May budget, the Labor government has failed the Australian people yet again. </PARA>

As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said in his budget speech on 10 May, this is a budget that will maximise economic growth, reduce unemployment, promote social justice and reduce the budget deficit, without increasing taxes&mdash;despite the comments of the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). I feel a bit sorry for the honourable member for Adelaide because, unlike a lot of her wealthy constituents and most of her male colleagues, the honourable member cannot join the Adelaide Club. I suppose she is a bit disappointed about that. I would not be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Adelaide continues this nonsense from the opposition benches that somehow this government is a high taxing government and that the budget is a high taxing budget. Of course, that is absolute nonsense, as I will illustrate. It is quite an achievement in anyone's language to deliver a budget that will maximise economic growth, reduce unemployment, promote social justice and reduce the budget deficit to $11.7 billion without increasing taxes. It is an achievement that only a Labor government is capable of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with the point that there are no increases in taxes in this budget. The opposition is trying to dispute this by claiming that because total government revenue is expected to rise there must be increased taxes. This cynical falsehood was promoted by the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) when he was the Leader of the Opposition and carried on by the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) when he was shadow Treasurer, and it is still being carried on by the honourable member for Mayo now in his capacity as the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that the failed Liberal candidate for the seat of Werriwa has twice been in the local papers making the same assertion and false claim. We know of his credibility after his abortive attempt to win the Werriwa by-election. This is the same bloke that believes that the local chamber of commerce in Campbelltown is a Labor Party front. I will say more about that some other time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no tax increases in this budget. In fact, Australians are now benefiting from the income tax cuts that were introduced last November. Anyone with any intelligence or honesty would understand that the reason that the budget papers are forecasting an increase in revenue is due to the benefits of the economic recovery and increased employment. Because there will be more people in jobs earning enough to be able to pay tax and because profits will increase, thereby attracting more tax revenue, the total revenue receivable will naturally increase. It is not that tax levels have increased but simply that there will be more people and more businesses actually paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition thinks this is bad. Obviously, it thinks that the economic recovery, increased business profits and increased job opportunities are bad news for Australia. It thinks it is bad news that government income will increase, and it tries to distort the truth with these false and cynical assertions that increased revenue means increased taxes. The only bad news in the budget is the bad news for the Liberal Party. This budget, together with the white paper and the community's reaction to both documents, is very bad news for the Liberal and National parties. It adds a further nail in the coffin of its electoral prospects. It might be bad news for the opposition, but that means it is good news for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the rhetoric and lies of the opposition, Australia remains the lowest taxed country in the OECD. This is what really hurts the opposition and its political supporters. As much as these conservatives like to perpetuate the myth that, under Labor, Australia is a high taxing country in order to set up the usual straw people and so that its wealthy supporters have something to whinge about, the facts do not support its arguments at all. We are the lowest taxed country in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some of us on this side of the House who do not necessarily think that being the lowest taxed country in the OECD is necessarily something to boast about. A fair and equitable taxation system is necessary to provide the revenue to enable governments to provide the services and programs that people expect, to provide the economic and social infrastructure and the social justice programs that people are entitled to expect and to provide access and equity for all Australians regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. It is  appropriate  that  services  and programs for disadvantaged members of our society be funded via taxation revenue from the better off. I believe a strong case could be made for saying that there are many people out there who could and should be paying more tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is clear that, because of the outstanding economic management of this government, we are able to provide a comprehensive range of social justice programs and community services despite being the lowest taxed country in the OECD. There is no better evidence than the enormous range of measures contained in the white paper on employment, industry and regional development and in this budget. As I said before, only a Labor government could ever hope to deliver such a package to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me examine some of the measures contained in the budget. The measures contained in the white paper will cost $6 1/2 billion over four years. This is a huge commitment by the government to assist long-term unemployed people and to create jobs. I have said publicly many times that the government created high expectations in the community for many months prior to the white paper. The white paper was to be the government's response to unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, which was rightly identified as the biggest political issue facing Australia as well as being a human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following nearly 12 months of wide consultation and debate around the country on unemployment, the white paper provides a comprehensive response that meets most of the reasonable expectations raised. Although I am sure we could all sit down and find an area or program which could have been given more money, the fact is that overall this is a magnificent package which will have a significant impact throughout Australia. The overwhelmingly positive response from the community to the white paper speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular note in the white paper are the initiatives on regional development. Some $151 million over four years has been allocated towards the national regional development strategy. This includes $70 million for a regional infrastructure fund and $81 million for the regional best practice program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will work with states, local government, business, unions and communities to maximise opportunities for economic growth and job creation at the regional level. This government will facilitate the establishment of regional economic development forums involving representatives of those groups that I have just mentioned. In some cases the existing regional organisations will meet the government's criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this process has already commenced in my electorate. Last week I was pleased to welcome the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) to the Macarthur region. The Deputy Prime Minister attended a meeting of the Macarthur regional task force, which is a subcommittee of the Macarthur Regional Organisation of Councils, MACROC. Following the meeting, he was a special guest at a cocktail party jointly hosted by the chair of MACROC, Councillor Sam Mir, and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At these two functions the minister and the government's white paper initiatives on regional development were well received by the business and local government representatives present.

There is universal recognition in the area of the importance of well managed and well resourced regional development and regional planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper also provides for the establishment of area consultative committees by the Department of Employment, Education and Training to generate community support for the job compact and other labour market programs and to facilitate the linking of these programs with regional development initiatives. These area consultative committees will also involve local businesses, unions, training providers and government representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to working with my colleagues the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) and the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) in the next few weeks in order to facilitate the effective establishment of these important regional bodies in south-west Sydney. The most significant announcement in the white paper for my electorate&mdash;indeed, for south-west Sydney and the greater western Sydney region&mdash;was the decision to fast-track the construction of a 2,900-metre runway at Badgerys Creek airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the obvious benefits for the national transport system of this decision, the development of Badgerys Creek airport, particularly with the construction of the associated road and rail links, will be an enormous boost to the development of western and south-western Sydney. Badgerys Creek, which is to be known as the Sydney West International Airport, will attract industries and many thousands of jobs to the area. The decision represents a major victory for all of the federal Labor MPs and local councils both in the inner city area near Kingsford Smith airport and in the western and south-western areas of Sydney who have campaigned long and hard for this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention some other significant budget measures. I was particularly pleased to see an additional $169 million over four years allocated for mental health programs. This includes $133 million in additional funds which will more than double the federal government's financial commitment to the national mental health strategy. Much of this money will be provided to state governments and will be used to address the areas of concern identified by the Burdekin report on human rights and mental illness which was released in 1993. As the convener of the Labor caucus working group on mental health, I look forward to working with the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), caucus members and the community in order to make sure that this additional funding delivers positive outcomes for people with mental illness or psychiatric disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other important initiatives in the human services and health area. These include an additional $500 million over five years for Aboriginal health programs and $209 million over four years for a national breast cancer program. In the housing portfolio, the budget also provides $63 million over four years for a range of initiatives to assist homeless people. These are just a few of the typical social justice policies of this government which have been delivered in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been very interesting over the last two or three days to listen to the various contributions to this debate and to reflect on some of the comments, particularly those from the opposition benches. Despite the media fanfare surrounding the leadership change in the Liberal Party, it is clear from this debate that nothing much has changed. The opposition is still the same tired old bunch of born to rule Tories with no policies and nothing to contribute but empty rhetoric attacking the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even today, in the wake of the incredibly positive economic news of five per cent growth and continuing low inflation, the opposition continues with this nonsense of preaching doom and gloom, not to mention the continued obsession with union bashing, as evidenced by the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in this House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took particular notice of some of the comments made by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) in her first speech. Unlike most of her colleagues, it could be said from the speech of the honourable member for Mackellar that at least she stands for something; at least she expresses a philosophy. She says that she believes in individualism and particularly asserts that individualism is preferable to collectivism. So at least she believes in something, even if the implication of her particular brand of individualism can be revealed as totally unfair, unjust and impractical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mackellar believes that collectivism is `where government is for groups and the individual can be sacrificed for the group'. I would have thought that such a description could easily apply to many quite normal and appropriate areas of society. As an ex-sportsman, it sounds to me like what it means to be a member of a team.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two points to make here. Firstly, this sort of philosophy is quite attractive to the wealthier and more advantaged individuals in our society; for example, the sorts of individuals who are wealthy and privileged enough to be members of the Melbourne Club or the Adelaide Club or to live in one of the million dollar mansions on Sydney Harbour or in the electorate of the honourable member for Mackellar. This description alone excludes most Australians. In the case of the Melbourne Club and the Adelaide Club, all women are excluded. The honourable member for Mackellar is not eligible to join the Adelaide Club. The honourable member for Adelaide is not even eligible to join the Adelaide Club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of these policies of so-called individualism on the less well off in our society would be disastrous. But, in any case, this so-called policy of individualism is hardly reflected in the policies, if you can call them policies, of the current opposition. We hear much more noise from the Liberal Party about states rights than we ever do about individual rights, as evidenced by the coalition's attitude towards the Tasmanian homosexual laws issue, where apparently the rights of the state to make repressive and draconian laws are much more important than the rights of many individual Tasmanians. You have only to look at the coalition's attitude towards the Native Title Act, where the states rights were much more important than the rights of individual Aboriginal people who had been dispossessed and disadvantaged for 206 years. There is a lot of contradiction and hypocrisy on the opposition side with respect to individual rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would again like to return to the comments made today by the honourable member for Bennelong with respect to unionism. He asked a question which implied that union members were given preference in certain industrial agreements. He thought that was dreadful. It should be pointed out to the opposition, particularly the honourable member for Bennelong and his mate the honourable member for La Trobe, that there is nothing very unfair about union members being given preference in certain circumstances. After all, to be a member of a union you have to pay union dues. It is like being a member of a club. If you want to have the benefits of union membership, you have to pay your dues. If you do not pay your union dues, why should you attract the benefits of union membership?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just like being a member of the Adelaide Club, or any club for that matter. If you are a member of a club, you reasonably expect that the advantages and the privileges that come with being a member of that club are afforded only to members. So why is being a member of a union any different? If you are a member of a union, you are entitled to the benefits that the collectivism of being a member of a union brings to you. If you are not a member of a union, why should you get the benefits which have been hard won by the union movement over the years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, a double standard on the part of the opposition has been revealed. Those opposite set up straw people in the form of unions and union members. They attack unionists and workers. They think there is something wrong with union members having rights. They suggest that non-union members should have the same rights, even though they do not pay to be members of unions. But it is a bit different when it comes to the membership of clubs which people also have to pay for. If you are a member of a club, you are entitled to expect that the benefits of that membership fee that you pay will apply only to club members. But it is different when you talk about unions, according to the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not be surprised about this. The opposition, as evidenced by its recent changes to the frontbench, is very much a conservative party which is moving further away from the mainstream of Australian politics and political thought.

If, as many of us suspect, the investment predictions which underpin the spending initiatives contained in the budget do not eventuate, the people of Australia will have to foot a very large bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not doubt the government's prediction of private sector investment growth simply for the sake of being pessimistic. I, for one, would love the government to prove me wrong and come up with the 14.5 per cent growth in investment which this budget relies on. However, the reality of the matter is that there are few, if any, indications to suggest that this goal can be reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, it would be quite a dramatic turnaround for a 14.5 per cent surge in investment to follow a year in which investment has increased by only one per cent. It becomes even more ridiculous when one considers that that modest increase was assisted by the investment allowance, which is due to end in 30 days time. Independent forecasters Access Economics also cast doubt on the government's predictions of a growth surge by calculating their own estimate, which was a much more modest increase of 7.75 per cent&mdash;almost half of what the government predicted. In fact, the government's own adviser, Treasury, clearly doubts the accuracy of the prediction. It warns against high expectation in the investment led recovery at least three times throughout the budget papers, with comments such as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An upturn in business investment is expected to occur during 1993-94. Although growth in plant and equipment and in non-residential construction is expected to fall back towards more sustainable levels during the year, the pick up will still be moderate by past standards.</PARA>
<PARA>We can refer to last year's standard of one per cent growth. Perhaps that is what Treasury was referring to. This note of caution is reinforced by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which said in its budget response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a forecast built on hope rather than any kind of solid evidence. And if private investment does not reach the level forecast, most of the other figures in the Budget, including the future size of the deficit are open to serious question.</PARA>
<PARA>The federal government would do well to heed the advice of the ACCI which does, after all, represent the employers and business people of Australia who will actually be making the decision to invest or not to invest over the coming years. They are the people who will take the risks and put their money and lifetime savings on the line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite advice and opinion to the contrary, the government expects us to believe that it knows businesses better than anyone else and that its flimsy predictions should be believed. Why should we believe the government? It has been wrong so many times that it does not deserve our trust. It certainly has not earned it. On the eve of the worst recession this country has seen in 60 years, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), at that time the Treasurer, was telling us `economic policy has worked and is working'. If the recessionary years that followed were an example of the result of a working economics policy, I shudder to think what would have happened had Mr Keating's policies not worked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to what the budget did or, should I say, did not offer the people in my electorate of Maranoa and, indeed, many rural and regional Australians. Of most concern to my constituency is the way this government approaches the issue of road funding. It may have escaped the notice of the Keating cabinet, ensconced, as it generally is, in capital city offices and meeting rooms, that Australia is a very large country. This means it is often a challenge to get from one part of it to another. Fortunately, movement around and across the continent is greatly enhanced by the provision of roads. However, it is not good enough to simply build roads. They have to be maintained, extended if necessary and, at the end of their natural life, replaced. Given this government's track record of consistently reducing road funding, it appears to be under the impression that roads are maintenance free, self-renewing and expandable. Unfortunately, that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the matter is that much more of our regional road network is nearing the end of its natural life. The state of disrepair has reached the point at which some sections of the network are beginning to hurt businesses in terms of freight time and costs. Worse still, the state of many of our neglected roads has become so hazardous that, inevitably, lives will be lost. Anybody who spends any amount of time travelling on regional roads&mdash;obviously, the Prime Minister and his cabinet chums do not&mdash;would be absolutely certain of their poor and potentially dangerous condition. Apparently, that is not a concern of this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the regional and rural parts of Australia that I travel in, the truckies in particular often say that it is not the damage their trucks do to the roads that concerns them, it is the damage that the roads do to their trucks. This financial year the government will spend $820 million on roads. That represents a savage cut of $200 million over last year's allocation and around $800 million less than we saw in 1992-93. The government has taken the butcher's knife to the funding of our roads. The tragic irony of this situation is that it should not happen. There is absolutely no excuse, no reason, no justification, for putting people's lives at risk as this government has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Roads are not free. They are not things that the government generously provides out of its own pocket. Road users pay for roads every time they put petrol or diesel in their motor vehicles or trucks. In fact, this financial year road users will pay the government $9.7 billion in fuel tax. Imagine how safe, how efficient and how extensive our road network would be if a sizeable proportion of that money were spent where it should be&mdash;on roads. As little as 8.5 per cent of fuel tax collections will be spent on roads. That proportion will continue to decline, reaching a mere 7.5 per cent in 1997-98. That is the real tragedy. The money is there. The transport industries are paying for roads, but those roads are not being delivered by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will continue to let our roads deteriorate and to let them claim nearly 2,000 lives annually. In the last financial year, 1,946 lives were lost on Australian roads. The government will not heed the advice of Coroner Kevin Waller who, when recalling the bus disasters of 1989, described the Commonwealth's lack of interest in creating a safe highway from Newcastle to Tweed Heads as a scandal, and went on to call the government's road funding strategy a `sham'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is apparently impervious to advice of any kind, if its refusal to deal with the findings of the McKinsey report on business investment in regional Australia is anything to go by. For a number of reasons, the findings should not be ignored. Firstly, they came at a price&mdash;$1.25 million&mdash;to the taxpayers of this country. Secondly, the McKinsey report is not a purely academic study but rather a report based on discussions with actual business people&mdash;the people who drive regional economies. Thirdly, the report should not be ignored because it provides some very sound advice to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McKinsey report correctly identified the recession, employment on-costs, such as the training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee levy, payroll tax and labour market inflexibility as the main impediments to regional investment. It is clear that these findings have gone right over the government's head. The government's budget and its twin, Working Nation, offer little in the way of reduced costs besides the welcome suspension of the training guarantee levy. It is worth noting the comments of some regional business people, which are recorded in the McKinsey report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is Government working as hard as I am to increase productivity and reduce costs? I'm doing what I can, but I can't control what they do&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>`they' being the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They've got to reduce costs too.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most telling findings of the McKinsey report was that 29 per cent of surveyed regional businesses indicated that they would hire another person if on-costs were lower. I urge the government to take that particular finding very seriously, as it quite clearly identifies an area in which a small amount of reform could have a huge effect on the problem of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In plotting its role in the future of regional Australia, the government also had benefit and guidance from the Industry Commission and the Bureau of Industry Economics. The Industry Commission released its final report on the impediments to regional industry adjustment in April this year. Its most significant recommendation was a call for greater flexibility in workplace bargaining in order to recognise the particular conditions faced by workplaces in different regions. Naturally, this was completely ignored by the government in favour of the restrictive provisions of the Industrial Relations Reform Act which, as the Industry Commission politely points out, is highly unlikely to deliver to regional workplaces. Not surprisingly, the ACTU and the Department of Industrial Relations were highly critical of the Industry Commission's recommendation in relation to workplace flexibility. However, the private sector, local and state governments were supportive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most supportive organisations, of course, apart from the National Farmers Federation and the Geelong City Council, was the government of Tasmania. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The comments made by the Commission in relation to the need for institutional impediments to greater flexibility in work practices and conditions to be removed are strongly supported.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the widespread support for the freeing-up of the industrial relations system, it is particularly disappointing that the government did not seize the opportunity presented by the release of Working Nation to announce a new era of workplace bargaining. There is now ample evidence to suggest that the work force of regional Australia would have been among the first to benefit, had it done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bureau of Industry Economics also released a report in April, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Regional development: pattern and policy implications</EMPHASIS>. This report emphasised the importance of government getting the fundamentals right and then keeping out of the way. Such fundamentals include sound management of the public sector, the provision of infrastructure and amenities, the operation of markets for capital, labour and technology, the regulatory and competitive framework and the stability of policy settings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that this very prudent advice has not fallen on deaf government ears, although the decimation of the road funding budget, which I addressed earlier, would suggest it has. It is unfortunate that the great proliferation of advice and opinion which has surfaced from these reports and others, including the Kelty task force and state governments, has not been utilised to prepare a detailed and targeted strategy for development of regional and rural Australia. The cynics amongst us would probably suspect that the millions the federal government has spent sending consultants around the country were merely to create a facade of genuine government concern for the distinct problems of regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what the government's motivation, the fact remains that we are left with a humble $263 million commitment over four years to assist the development of regional Australia. Although I am thankful that the government has finally pieced together some commitment, I am particularly concerned by the lack of focus and vision of the government's strategy. It is not clear from chapter 7 of Working Nation, which contains the government's regional development strategy, exactly what it is attempting to achieve nor indeed how it will intend to monitor the success or otherwise of these new initiatives. There are vague allusions to the need for all Australians to participate in national recovery and growth but no clear aims or objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of equal concern is the complete lack of detail about the initiatives&mdash;and for this there is absolutely no excuse. With 14 months preparation and an array of reports and papers, there can be no reason for the lack of a comprehensive guide to the way the government's initiatives will work. The regional best practice program, for example, provides for assistance to regions to establish a representative region-wide development organisation. The paper adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many cases, existing regional organisations will meet the criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>What criteria, one might ask? What form will the assistance take? Will it be financial assistance in the form of grants, will it be personnel or simply guidance and advice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, part of the regional best practice program is a promise of assistance to regional organisations to focus on the strengths and opportunities of the region. Again, what exactly is meant by assistance? What does the government intend by this focussing concept? Is it for promotional purposes or resource allocation reasons? What of the regional demonstration projects? Where are the guidelines for these projects to ensure the funds which are available are distributed prudentially and not according to the political persuasion of the region's federal member with a great big whiteboard? Similarly, I would urge the government to ensure that the regional strategic infrastructure fund is managed with a clear focus on the needs of the region and not on the needs of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the government's regional development strategy will be judged by its growth or further decline of regional Australia. The McKinsey report contains some chilling findings to which the federal government must be held accountable. It found that 41 per cent of Australia's regions were in decline; most of these are small country towns which provide essential services to the agriculture resource industries which continue to underpin our export trade. The problem is that the declining population is bringing about a commensurate decline in services and facilities. If the government's strategy does not have a positive impact on these regions, there can be no doubt that the decline will continue and those few who defiantly remain in those regions to produce world class wool, beef and crops will become a permanent underclass. I am not convinced that the government's regional development strategy provides the assistance those 41 per cent of regional areas need, but I would love nothing more than for this government to prove me wrong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House the final report of the commission of inquiry into the future of the Commonwealth lands at Shoalwater Bay, Queensland, which was submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) today. Shoalwater Bay is a superb area of pristine wilderness, 60 kilometres north-east of Rockhampton. By good fortune, 520,000 hectares of wilderness has been largely protected through acquisition by the army in 1965. The Shoalwater Bay military training area, together with the Byfield National Park, is the largest area of undeveloped land on the east coast of Australia except for the Cape York Peninsula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980, the area was listed on the Register of the National Estate because of its size, its almost pristine condition and the great diversity of landforms and habitats. The federal government announced an inquiry in December 1992 in response to pressure from local conservationists against proposals to mine the 70 kilometres of coastline from Corio Bay to Island Head. The inquiry and a recent report by Scott Johnston and Keith Jaffray, published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wilderness the Future</EMPHASIS> by the Total Environment Centre, clearly identify the factors that make this area so worth protecting as a wilderness area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area contains giant parabolic dune systems, which are up to 200 metres high and stretch up to 12 kilometres inland. They are one of the most diverse and least disturbed examples of this landform in Australia. The Shoalwater-Byfield wilderness contains 51 per cent of Australia's bird species, 27 per cent of mammal species, 13 per cent of frog species, and 12 per cent of reptile species. It ranks higher in biodiversity than such places as Fraser Island and Cape Tribulation. Even limited studies show the area supports 355 native animal species. It also contains at least 19 rare and threatened flora and fauna species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shoalwater Bay borders on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Its marine estuarine systems are the last large, undisturbed and fully functioning systems south of Princess Charlotte Bay on Cape York. It contains 150 square kilometres of undisturbed mangroves. Shoalwater Bay is therefore pollution free, thus ensuring a healthy Barrier Reef and the maintenance of the local fishing industry worth $22 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO has recently advised that this area is an `ecological laboratory, a living inventory for biodiversity and an ideal centre for the study of biodiversity'. It says that `much of the woodland vegetation is well represented and is becoming endangered elsewhere'. The area represents the largest remaining area of old growth eucalypt forest in Central and Southern Queensland outside of the Clarke and Carnarvon Range areas. A survey prepared by the commission of inquiry showed that the residents of the Rockhampton area were vitally concerned with the protection of their water supply and the protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report clearly recognises that mining would jeopardise the huge sand dunes which act as a natural filter and storage facility. The dunes help to provide clean, fresh water to Yeppoon and Byfield at a time when surrounding water supplies are plagued with blue-green algae. The report also recognised the claims to the area of the local Darambal Aboriginal people and identified significant archaeological sites. These sites meet the criteria for national estate significance and are located mainly in the eastern dune fields and the coastal zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim report indicated that sandmining Shoalwater may contribute $260 million to the Australian economy&mdash;a pitiful figure in comparison with the value of a unique ecosystem, the quality and reliability of Livingstone shire's water supply, the local fishing industry, ecotourism, aboriginal rights and future scientific research. I am informed that sandmining was rejected by the Bjelke-Petersen government. If it rejected sandmining, it must be worth keeping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report makes a clear and overwhelming case that no mining of any type should be permitted. It also recommends that both tourism and defence uses should be clearly defined and restricted. These conclusions are undeniable and I am confident that they will be accepted by the minister and the government. While I certainly applaud the commissioners on the depth, clarity and recommendations of their report, they have been timid in respect to the use of the area for defence purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the army has been highly responsible in its management of the area. Nevertheless, for all the reasons set out in the report defence uses must be phased out. Only the declaration of a wilderness national park for the whole 520,000 hectares can achieve proper safeguards for the local water supplies, fishing industry, archaeological sites and the World Heritage values of this unique environment. The Shoalwater Bay area is unique and deserves to be ranked with the Tasmanian wilderness and the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I am not certain whether it is strictly a point of order, but this involves matters which are appearing currently before a proceeding. Allegations that assert to be facts, matters which are put in the way of assertions of behaviour which carry criminal conduct as a necessary corollary, before charges are laid, are matters which I think should be treated somewhat seriously. I am not certain as to whether or not one could regard them as strictly matters which are sub judice, but the sub judice rule is not a rule which exists in standing orders; it is a rule which exists in order to provide protections to individuals whose rights may be affected in subsequent proceedings. I do not how far we are going to follow this track in relation to matters about which no charges have been laid and in which individuals are being named.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approximately 3 1/2 weeks ago a column that I wrote was published in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>. The column related to an organisation called the Australian Family Association. At the very conclusion of that column I referred to another organisation called the Australian Defence Association, which I described as being associated with the extreme Right in Australian politics. Mr Michael O'Connor&mdash;I think his correct title is executive director&mdash;then wrote a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> stating that, contrary to my suggestion, the organisation had no connection with the extreme Right in Australian politics and was not a front for the National Civic Council, which clearly is an organisation of the extreme Right in Australian politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise today to point out that I did not make that accusation, namely that the Australian Defence Association is a front of the National Civic Council, for a very specific reason. That reason is that the Australian Defence Association was established as, and was for a period of time, a front of the National Civic Council until late 1982, when there was a split in the National Civic Council. A significant proportion of the supporters and members of that organisation left the organisation, mainly consisting of the then leaderships of the Federated Clerks Union and the shop assistants union and formed another organisation of a similar nature which initially commenced under the title of the Industrial Action Fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr O'Connor, the leader of the Australian Defence Association, was an integral part of the group that split from the National Civic Council at that time. That group was headed by Mr John Maynes, the national vice-president of the National Civic Council prior to the split, and also at that stage the national president of the Federated Clerks Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point and subsequently, Mr O'Connor was employed by an organisation called FEDSDA Credit Cooperative, a small credit union established by the Federated Clerks Union and the shop assistants union to provide credit union facilities to the members of those unions. When I took office as secretary of the Federated Clerks Union, Victorian Branch in 1988, I discovered that the Victorian branch of the union was subsidising Mr O'Connor's wages in that position by roughly $13,000 per annum with very little genuine return to the union membership. I speculated at the time on precisely how much work he was doing for the credit union and how much he was doing for the Australian Defence Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr O'Connor has remained active in the breakaway group from the National Civic Council since that split. Although he is technically correct in denying that the Australian Defence Association and he have any connection with the National Civic Council, there is still a very clear connection with that particular strand of politics in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Association is a classic example of a front organisation established by the National Civic Council. It has a number of fairly prominent, mostly retired, military figures to add respectability but it is run by people who, under any test, would be considered to be extreme right wing fanatics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that in recent times Mr O'Connor and the association have endeavoured to at least moderate their public image, even if their true position on certain matters has not altered. For example, in 1986 the Dibb report was fairly savagely criticised by the Australian Defence Association, as seen in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article of 24 June 1986. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 March of this year, the Dibb report is now referred to by Mr O'Connor as a `landmark' report. Mr O'Connor's deputy and associate editor of the Australian Defence Association's journal, Mr Brian Ridge, is also a longstanding activist with a National Civic Council background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place these things on record to indicate that, although it is correct to say that the Australian Defence Association is no longer a National Civic Council front, it is certainly still very squarely in that part of the political spectrum in this country. It therefore disturbs me that it is seen by sections of the media as a mainstream source of credible opinion on defence issues when, I would submit, it clearly is not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I would like to put on record the concerns of two of my constituents&mdash;Mr and Mrs Barnes&mdash;who are trying to get their mother out to Australia. Recognising the limited amount of time that I have, I will go directly to the issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 January 1992, Mrs Barnes's mother applied to come to Australia. She filled in a form 47 while a form 40, the form for sponsorship, was filled in by Mr and Mrs Barnes. In the process of having her medical, the radiologists detected, or thought they detected, old TB scars on both upper lobes, although, as they said, they could not detect signs of active disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The radiologists wrote to the applicant's doctor and asked for further tests to be carried out. In fact, a series of tests was carried out at the hospital at that time because there were a couple of other factors to be examined. One factor was mobility, which was answered satisfactorily by her doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hospital doctor involved wrote and said that the later set of chest X-rays were, if anything, a little better than the earlier ones, with moderate resolution of the upper left zone shadowing. The doctor said that she was not being treated for tuberculosis but could see why a radiologist may have queried this possibility. That was followed up by a series of other tests carried out for this applicant. The letter that followed through from Aintree Hospitals said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chest x-ray shadowing which this lady has is longstanding. Broncheolar lavage has been performed of the area of suspicion on the chest x-ray and this shows no evidence of tuberculosis.</PARA>
<PARA>This letter was actually written on 24 September 1992 and forwarded to the Australian office in Manchester. The application was knocked back by the department, and the date of that letter was 24 February 1993&mdash;some considerable time later. It was knocked back on the basis of item 9 of schedule 1 of the regulation. In fact, item 9 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the applicant is free from:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)tuberculosis or any other communicable disease of a fatal or serious nature which, in the opinion of a Commonwealth medical officer, is a threat to public health in Australia; and is not suspected of having contracted such a disease. . .</PARA>
<PARA>This application eventually went through the tribunal process, and the tribunal, in its conclusion, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal has previously held on a number of occasions that, whilst items 9(a) and 9(b) require the Tribunal to be an arbiter of fact with respect to the existence of the disease in question, an opinion formed by a CMO under item 9(c) above is not reviewable by the Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>As a result of his assessment the chief medical officer indicated, without taking into account the further tests that were carried out, that this particular woman had tuberculosis. The real problem that exists, as far as I am concerned, is the follow-up, where the tribunal says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tribunal has also stated that this situation is unfortunate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and certainly it is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as the CMO's in the Migrant Medical Clearances unit, who make thousands of assessments per year, are not resourced to provide reviews of their own opinions at the level demanded by the public of bodies such as this Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a case of a lady who, clearly, as has been shown by the evidence provided by doctors, has not got tuberculosis or has not had tuberculosis. Because the decision of the chief medical officer is not reviewable, the only way the tribunal can act on this is for the chief medical officer to take action to look at this case. I find it disgraceful that, although, clearly, evidence is available, funds cannot be provided for the chief medical officer to reassess his original position based on the information of the additional medical assessments that have been done by specialists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the mess that the government has created with occupational superannuation. I want to give the House an example. I had a letter from a constituent referring to a visit he made to Mildura to pick grapes. He was anxious to work and he went to assist a friend in picking his crop. On 14 April 1993 his employer paid an amount of $43.38 into the Australian Farm Superannuation Fund for his benefit. He telephoned the administrator of Australian Eagle Life Ltd on 21 January 1994 to find out the balance in the account. To his disgust he found that the balance in the account was zero. When he questioned the company why this was so, it was indicated to him that a weekly fee of 85c was charged, even though, except for an insurance cover cost, there were no other transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a terrible indictment of the government's occupational superannuation that someone who is prepared to work and has paid into a superannuation fund finds that there is no benefit to him whatsoever. There are ways around this problem. One of the ways&mdash;and I declare my interest&mdash;is a building society superannuation savings account. The government is resisting allowing building societies to participate in superannuation savings accounts. The accounts would be subject to preservation and other requirements applying to superannuation savings generally and to preferential taxation treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounts would not require a trust deed or be subject to expensive prospectus requirements. Contributions would be deposits made with the society. They would be transacted in simple, plain English terms and conditions to comply with ISC standards. They would be contained in the records of account which would either be a simple passbook or a regular statement account style. The distinction between superannuation savings accounts and normal savings accounts would be emphasised and drawn to the attention of members. Ease and simplicity of deposit making would be features, using the branch network, direct crediting systems and automatic teller machines. There would be no special or extra fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what my constituent, Mr Adrian Johnson, objected to in his letter to me. He objected to the fees that were charged on this account. The fees built up and totally wiped out the amount of $43.38. There was absolutely no benefit to a person who was working and paying into an occupational superannuation fund which the government insisted that his employer must provide for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a suggestion to the government. I would be pleased if the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns), who are at the table, would take this on board, because I know they are listening quite intently. The government is looking for answers to the mess that it has created with occupational superannuation in this country.

They have been in business for 25 years, and the lady tells me that she has been helping her husband, except for the last couple of months of her pregnancy, drive the vehicles. As we could imagine, they have never had it easy in their business, but their current situation is the most difficult that they have encountered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bureaucratic paperwork, union influence on their business and government taxes have put enormous pressure on their business. They used to have 10 trucks, but now they are down to six. They have found that it is just not worth employing people because of the union problem. They found out that it is easier to drive the trucks themselves. This is what they are trying to do, but it is having an effect on their family, and in the long run it will have an effect on their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the longest they have ever gone without buying any equipment because, if one wants to buy a prime mover, as the shadow minister, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is at the table, would know, it costs about $200,000 without the trailer. Of course, $60,000 is paid in sales tax. We can imagine the problems that they are having in trying to find the money to purchase new trucks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that not so long ago in the Hay district there used to be about 40 trucks carting stock, but now the numbers are down to about 10. Many of the people who were driving those trucks have left the district because there is no longer a market for their skills. That is another reason why there are not many people remaining in rural Australia. Some of those people have gone on to unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest single burden on this business is fuel tax. In the last 12 months, for example, they paid $148,672 in diesel tax. Under the government's tax hikes in the 1993-94 budget it is estimated that the average rig will cost an extra $6,400 a year to run. That includes sales tax increases on spare parts and fuel excise increases. However, the coalition promised that we would abolish the excise because we believe in genuine regional development and we believe in doing something positive for rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This financial year the government will collect $9,706,000,000 in fuel excise and will spend only $820 million on roads. People in the west know exactly what bad roads mean. The honourable shadow minister at the table recently spent some time in a truck driving up the Kidman Way, part of which is located in my electorate, to see the standard of the roads and see what can be done to try to overcome the problem. The enormous discrepancy between the amount of fuel tax collected and the amount spent on roads is a scandal. Until we do something about spending more money on roads we are not going to get anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government can never be expected to be taken seriously in regard to regional development unless it cuts the price of transport in regional and rural areas and increases road funding to provide a safe and comprehensive road network throughout the nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. Normal security precautions, which have been in effect virtually unchanged since the introduction of the M113 APC in 1964, were in force at the time of the incident.</PARA>

Ammunition stored in other circumstances is physically picquetted 24 hours a day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) All types of small arms ammunition, up to and including .50 calibre machine gun rounds, used by the Australian Defence Force is commercially available from Australian and overseas suppliers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) There is no formal policy on the amount of fuel to be left in an APC when not in use. However, it is normal practice to refuel any vehicle immediately after use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The level of out of hours surveillance of Defence premises depends on the relative importance of the facility for national security. For example, facilities which are deemed to be major assets are accorded a level of physical security which includes surveillance by guards, mobile or roving patrols or approved intrusion alarm systems. At the other end of the scale, facilities of lesser importance in terms of national security may not require out of hours surveillance but, where appropriate, duty personnel and Service police provide a degree of monitoring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) During the 1981/82 and 1982/83 Victorian summer fire seasons the Victorian and Commonwealth Governments conducted a cooperative trial to evaluate the use of Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) C130 Hercules aircraft for bushfire suppression. The Hercules was fitted with a Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System (MAFFS) which was loaned to the Victorian Government by the United States (US) Forests Service. The MAFFS system, which carries 11,300 litres of fire retardant slurry, is able to be fitted to the Hercules without requiring modification to the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trials were conducted in an operational environment and were thoroughly evaluated by a project team from the Fire Research Section of the then Forests Commission of Victoria (FCV). The Hercules made a total of 193 drops on 29 fires over the two fire seasons, covering a wide range of vegetation and fire types, and intensities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FCV provided fire retardant mixing and loading facilities and provided experienced fire service personnel to supervise airborne operations, ensuring that fire-bombing from the Hercules was integrated into the fire control strategy in the most effective manner. Prior to conducting the trials, the RAAF crews and FCV personnel involved received extensive training in the application and operation of the system from the US Forests Service and the US Air National Guard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evaluation demonstrated that, while the MAFFS-equipped Hercules could be successfully incorporated into fire-suppression operations, it did not significantly improve aerial attack capability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was due to the system not being effective on fires more intense than those successfully attacked by smaller, lower cost fire-bombing aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) At this time the Commonwealth has decided not to proceed with the use of Hercules aircraft for the purpose of fire-bombing. This approach reflects the results of the 1981/82 and 1982/83 trials and of additional research conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisa</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">tion (CSIRO) into aerial fire fighting capability during 1984 and 1985. The CSIRO study found that larger fixed-wing aircraft, including RAAF Hercules, were not cost-effective for fire suppression under Australian conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this issue is to be discussed at the 1994 meeting of the National Emergency Management Committee, which is the peak national body, consisting of state and territory authorities, for emergency management issues. Should a national view on this issue emerge at this meeting, it will be discussed further at a Ministerial meeting scheduled for later this year.</PARA>
