<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the interruption of my remarks I was making the point that many members opposite had suggested that in some strange way or other this debate on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill had been brought on completely out of the blue to try to embarrass the Tasmanian government and Tasmania. I was pointing out that nothing could be further from the truth. On two occasions, in 1979 and more recently in the time of the Field government, Labor members of parliament in Tasmania had attempted to repeal the Tasmanian laws which proscribe homosexual conduct. They had been unsuccessful because the bills to remove these provisions from the statute books had been defeated in the Tasmanian Legislative Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite then had the gall to stand in this House and say that the proceedings of this parliament were overriding the democratic procedures of Tasmania. Everybody here knows that the Legislative Council in Tasmania consists of rotten pocket boroughs, that it needs to be properly reformed and that reform is long overdue. One would hope that the proceedings which have been commenced in the High Court to seek to do just that will have some effect on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important point I want to draw from this is that efforts have been made in Tasmania. They have been thwarted by Liberals and conservatives in the upper house in Tasmania by people who have not a broad picture of the world, who do not understand the implications of their acts. This has led to the tragic situation where Tasmania and good and decent Tasmanians are held up to be a laughing stock in many parts of the world. I know many Tasmanians. They are appalled at the legislation that still exists on their statute books, and their statute books only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, all Tasmanians are victims of the social fascists who seek to impose their morality through the application of the criminal law. The use of the criminal law in this way brings into contempt the criminal law itself. Extraordinarily, probably in breach of the criminal law itself, the Tasmanian Attorney has said that he has no intention of enforcing this law. If he is not going to do that, it clearly brings the whole of the law into contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see the extent of the problem from the point of view of the Tasmanian government if we think about the fact that, even using the most conservative assessment of the percentage of homosexuals in the community of four per cent and assuming that there is a reasonably active homosexual community amongst that four per cent, it is likely that there are a million and more transgressions of the Tasmanian law every year, not one of them being brought before the courts because of the Attorney-General in Tasmania saying clearly that he has no intention of enforcing this law. As I said, a law which is not enforced, a law which cannot be enforced, is a bad law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, it is certainly not clear exactly what the people of Tasmania really think about this. It is unclear what the majority of Tasmanians think on this issue. Certainly, the community is heavily divided. I believe that the level of protection of basic human rights in Australia should not depend on where a person happens to live. That ought not be the criteria by which people's rights are determined. It is an absolutely intolerable situation for our nation that a person can undertake certain sexual conduct in private without any direct interest from the law in five of the states while in Tasmania that person can be brought before the courts, prosecuted and, if found guilty, subjected to heavy punishment by imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard all the arguments from those opposite, with their hands on their hearts, about their not wanting to see the law enforced. That is not the point. The practical effect of the position those opposite have taken is that the law in Tasmania would remain as it is and 400,000-odd Australian citizens would have very different human rights from those of the rest of the people of this nation. That is not a situation which should be allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the Tasmanian law which I find quite interesting is that this provision was put into the Tasmanian law as section 122 in 1924 and in fact applies to women as well as men. When it was put in, it was probably seen as somewhat enlightened in that it applied to women as well. There is a very cute piece of history about this type of legislation in common law countries. It was originally put into the British criminal law at the time Palmerston was Prime Minister. He was a very cautious fellow and it was put to him, by his advisers as I understand it, that bringing these matters before Queen Victoria would be almost too much for her, the sort of thing that would send her reeling and looking for the smelling salts. So they worked out a compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation in Britain, which was the root of this legislation, applied only to males because it was thought that it would be possible to raise with the good Queen Victoria that these types of activities might occur with males. The idea of suggesting that females should do this sort of thing was quite beyond the sorts of things one could converse with the Queen about in the 1860s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very exciting anecdote. I don't know what it has to do with the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G4">Mr DUNCAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has a lot to do with the bill because it was an attempt at that time to impose what was then seen as Christian morality. I might say that this was at a time when a lot of Christians were still trying to justify slavery as part of Christian doctrine. Tasmania subsequently took this up in its legislation. It had enough guts to actually apply it to everybody by then, but the point is that this sort of legislation should never have been on the books of any of the states of Australia. That the Tasmanian government has not had the guts to be sensible enough to stand up to the Christian fascists who are pushing this sort of doctrine I think is to its eternal condemnation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a great pity that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer)&mdash;as well as other opposition members&mdash;who on other occasions has made very clear his views on the criminal law governing homosexuality, has not had the guts, decency and strength to stand up on this occasion in this parliament and make his views clear. He has wimped it. There is no other word for it. It is, I think, an indication of his weakness and lack of leadership that he did not go straight to Tasmania and put his leadership on the line by saying to the Tasmanian government, `You people have got to do the right thing by Australia, otherwise we will be back in the national parliament voting with the Labor government to make sure that these pernicious laws are removed from the statute books.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been impressed by the contributions some members opposite have made. I have previously referred to the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth). In supporting this legislation, I can do no more than quote her because I think she summed the argument up perfectly when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by allowing this bill to pass through the House, I am not promoting homosexuality; I am merely sanctioning the right of each of us to make and live by our own decisions. I wish to stress that I respect the opinion of those who have concluded that homosexuality is immoral, but I would simply ask that, in turn, these people respect the right of others to form their own moral judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I said, you could not put it better than that. I commend the speech by the honourable member for Adelaide. I wish to refer to other matters which have been raised, particularly by some members opposite who have shown not much more than rabid humbug in the way they have approached this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter concerns AIDS being drawn into the debate. It is true that Tasmania has the lowest rate of HIV infection in Australia. I do not want to go into the detail of this, but there are many reasons why that may well be the case, such as the fact that Tasmania is an island, is relatively isolated and has a relatively low homosexual community compared with some other states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complete contra of that is that the second lowest rate of HIV infection is in my own state of South Australia, which more than 20 years ago passed legislation to remove the proscription on homosexual behaviour from the criminal law. At that time, in the state parliament we had tories, conservatives and Liberals standing up saying, `Hellfire and damnation. This will be the homosexual paradise of Australia. We will have homosexual tourism. We will have all sorts of hellfire and damnation coming down upon us.' What is the judgment of history? The judgment of history is that no such thing occurred. No such thing took place. In spite of the fact that South Australia has had 20 years without a law against private homosexual behaviour, we have the second lowest HIV rate in the nation. It is, therefore, pretty clear that the argument that the HIV infection is in some way related to this law bears no weight at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to say something about the use of treaties. We have heard a great deal about how supposedly heinous it is to import decent, high quality international standards into this country by use of international treaties. The opposition likes to give the impression that treaties and their implementation in Australia are some new phenomenon undermining our constitution and allowing Australia to be governed from the outside and not by the institutions of this nation. Of course, nothing is further from the truth and the opposition knows that very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, when it was last in government, was no slouch when it came to treaty action. I am informed that the volumes of the Australian Treaty Series from 1976 to 1982 are not, on average, any slimmer than those before or after them. It is ironic that the opposition should now criticise the recent decision of the international Human Rights Committee on the Toonen case, as it was the Fraser government that ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It was that convention which gave rise to the international obligation which was the subject of the comment from the committee. So opposition members cannot run and hide and suggest that this is in some way a conspiracy by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental platform which gave rise to this piece of legislation being before this parliament was an international treaty that was ratified, brought into effect, by the Fraser government. That might irritate the opposition terribly, or the tail that wags the dog of the opposition, but it is a fact and those opposite cannot get away from it. The current government does not criticise the treaty action taken by the Fraser government; we support it. The real issue here is the essential need, in my view, for uniform human rights for all Australians. That is the fundamental position and that is the reason why the government supports this legislation and will see it through the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a brief contribution to this debate, although I was not originally intending to speak. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill has had a very long list of speakers and most of what can be said has been said. One of my responsibilities in the opposition is to be the spokesperson on HIV-AIDS matters. I thought I should, for the record, put the coalition's view in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not been easy for the coalition to come to a decision, because this bill balances two competing principles&mdash;the principle of an individual's right to privacy and the right of a sovereign state to manage its own affairs. It is disingenuous in the extreme to pretend that these are not principles that should be of concern to a national parliament. In the end, though, the coalition came to the view that privacy in itself is a principle of enormous importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into this parliament in 1987 during the time of the debates on the Australia Card Bill. When I made my maiden speech I talked, amongst other things, about the issue of privacy. I was a medical practitioner before I entered parliament. I was very concerned about the implications of the Australia Card Bill and what it might do to private aspects of a person's health&mdash;what might happen if it were known what medications people were on, what tests had been ordered. That concerned me greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many coalition people spoke in that debate, and in the end the bill was not implemented. In this instance our long-held position on privacy came up as the more important of those two competing principles. But I fully accept that some of my colleagues have come to a different view. They have done that after a great deal of soul-searching; and it has not been an easy decision for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of comments on HIV-AIDS. While this is not a debate on HIV-AIDS as such, I do want to reply to previous speakers. We are now 13 years into the AIDS pandemic. Around the world Australia's response is generally regarded as one of the better responses in the Western world. It is a response that has had cross-party support. It has been pretty good, except in regard to the threat posed to Aboriginal people. There our response has been pathetic, and we will be condemned by future generations for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our response to HIV-AIDS has been predicated on a harm reduction approach. We have taken a commonsense approach and asked: how can we stop people doing harm to themselves? As a result, needle exchange programs have been introduced right around the country, something our colleagues in the United States and other countries simply marvel at. This has meant that the case load of new infections in Australia has plateaued and may be starting to fall whereas in other Western countries it is still increasing. The basis of that has been encouraging people to come forward for voluntary testing and encouraging them to manage the responsibility of their own decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first parliament of which I was a member we had an AIDS liaison committee, which comprised people from all parties. Sadly, this is something which does not appear to still exist. In 1988 I was one of the people who was on a working group&mdash;the treatment and care subcommittee&mdash;set up to formulate the government's white paper on HIV-AIDS. That subcommittee travelled to Tasmania on two occasions. We talked to doctors, people in the community, including people in the gay community, about the issues surrounding the treatment and care of people with HIV-AIDS. Tasmania is quite different from every other state in Australia. I was quite shocked at the feelings of oppression and fear that the Tasmanian people had. Many Tasmanians were moving interstate to get treatment or to be tested for HIV because of the climate that existed in Tasmania then. I cannot say whether that climate still exists but it certainly did exist in 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania's low level of HIV infection is a factor which partly contributes to this. It is an island and there is a slower progression of the epidemic. But that just reflects the different time scale in the course of the epidemic. Tasmania also has the lowest level of testing of any state. I believe that reflects the fact that many people are going interstate for testing. The test does not tell us what state the person came from; it tells us what state the test was done in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own personal experience, and from talking to some of my former colleagues in the medical profession who treat people with HIV in Hobart, Melbourne and Sydney, there is not a professional working in the field who does not believe that a significant number of Tasmanians are moving interstate for treatment and care. I think that is unfortunate and it goes against the whole thrust of our response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic&mdash;a response that has had cross-party support and has been one of the most successful responses, if not the most successful response, in the Western world to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not, in any way, doubt the sincerity of my colleagues who have raised these issues. It is not something that we often talk about in this place or in the party room. I do not for a moment doubt their motives in raising it because it is a dreadful illness. If we want to see how bad it can be we just have to look at our northern neighbour, Thailand. I was reading a document yesterday put out by the United States government. It predicts that, within 15 years, one in five children between zero and four years of age will die every year in Thailand from HIV-AIDS. It is a matter that generates emotion and is something that we will have to continue to confront here and with our regional neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few comments about the speech of the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan). He highlighted the essentially political nature of this debate. I was disappointed by the disingenuousness of the speech. This place would be a lot better if there were a little more goodwill from time to time. If you are the Leader of the Opposition you have got to cop it all the time. I have had quite a lot to do with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) on this issue. He has shown guts, decency and strength. We could have endless debates about the structure of the Liberal Party but it is not an easy thing for a Liberal opposition leader in the federal parliament to take a position contrary to five Liberal state premiers. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done and he has my admiration for doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many debates in this House are framed in terms of black and white, of one side being right and one side being wrong. An identical situation is faced by a counsellor, particularly in marriage breakdowns. One side is 100 per cent right and sees the other side as 100 per cent wrong. I must say that I have always found difficulty in apportioning blame of any more than 51-49. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Makin portrayed how the Labor Party has approached this matter over the years. I would remind him that it was actually John Gorton who put in a private member's bill to decriminalise homosexual acts in the ACT. Amongst the people who opposed that legislation was the member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who sits in the Prime Minister's chair opposite. People's views can change over time. I accept that. But perhaps we should have a little bit more honesty in this debate and accept that this can be a difficult issue on both sides of the House from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Makin talked quite a bit about treaties and treaty making processes. The basis of this legislation is the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which is the cornerstone of human rights around the world. It is true that the Fraser government signed that, and that is something that the Fraser government can be proud of. What the Fraser government did not sign was the optional protocol that allows matters relating to Australia to be taken before a foreign body. It was the Labor Party that signed that. It signed it in the dying days of the last government, with very limited discussion. That is the basis of our concern. It is not the existence of the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights but the manner in which the optional protocol was signed and the manner in which it is being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One's view might change over time. The optional protocol might be something that one can accept down the road as one sees how it works. But when its first application is to effectively override the criminal law of a state, no matter how inappropriate that criminal law may be, it is a cause for legitimate debate. I look forward to finishing this debate and then putting it behind us.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there are a number of members of the coalition who are petrified of this matter coming to a vote. That is tragic in many ways. I happen to be one of those people who believe that we need to be tolerant and understanding of people with a different opinion. Legislators, in their views on these matters&mdash;I will quote the views of some members from the opposite side shortly&mdash;really need to be consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I do not agree with some members of the opposition who have spoken stridently in this debate, I respect them and I respect their consistency. One of those is the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). I think he has been consistent&mdash;consistently bad, but he has stuck to his views. When similar matters were voted on in the Queensland parliament, he registered his vote against the legislation. I will give that history when I come to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth recording the positions of opposition members in this debate. The debate was started for the opposition by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who said at page 1778:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our extreme reluctance to support the use of the Commonwealth's external affairs power to encroach on areas that are otherwise the responsibility of states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After careful consideration of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, the coalition has decided that the balance must come down on the side of protection of individual privacy in this instance. Therefore, we will not be opposing this bill.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on in his contribution to quote a legal opinion which the opposition received on the matter that shows, frankly, that the government is well within its rights in bringing this legislation before the parliament. That legal opinion basically says that, in the opinion of that person, it is clear the bill would give rise to a valid act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have the contribution of the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who said on page 1787:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have said that I believe the Tasmanian laws should be repealed, but I believe that the Tasmanian government should be the one to repeal them. The federal government should not intervene legislatively to render the laws ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA>But he says on balance that he will not oppose the bill. It was a very thoughtful contribution by the honourable member for Tangney, as most of his contributions are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have what I regard as probably the best contribution by an opposition member in this debate, and that came from the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), who stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The philosophy of liberalism grew out of the need to find a way to limit government, to protect people's freedom, and this is the philosophy that guides me. In consequence, I cannot oppose the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>We then heard the contribution by the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who has really led the charge as far as the opposition is concerned in this matter&mdash;that is, as far as his constituency is concerned and as far as Tasmania is concerned. He led the charge to the extent that material he circulated to his colleagues led to the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) being dismissed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) from the shadow ministry. The member for Braddon said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not oppose this legislation, but I certainly cannot support it because of the reasons which I have outlined to you&mdash;that is, based on false information to an overseas, unelected and unaccountable body. It is totally un-Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an interesting position. We will see how the honourable member for Braddon votes on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 1844, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) said, `I state that I am opposed to this bill.' I repeat, I have no problems in that. If he is opposed to the bill, I suggest that the natural consequence of that opposition should be that, if a vote is called for by one of his colleagues, he should support it. Some members are trying to have two bob each way. That is why I suggest that they are diminishing themselves. There needs to be some consistency. I suggest that someone who is on the record as saying `I oppose the bill' should have no hesitation in voting against the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) is concerned, frankly, I cannot pick up from his contribution which way he is going. Obviously, he is reserving his position to see whether a vote will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 1938, the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) declared his position, and it is a position of consultation. He goes on to talk about consultation but says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Tasmanian law is wrong. The issue of individual liberty is greater than states responsibilities on any issue. But I strongly believe the Labor Party's method of overturning this law is heavy-handed, paternalistic, politically motivated and wrong.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet we have heard from other members of the opposition how at a previous time Mr Gorton introduced a private member's bill in this house and that members of the coalition at that time, some of whom are still in this House&mdash;the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) being one&mdash;supported that. So it is as if it is a Labor Party inspired thing that we are doing. That is not true. I will go through the history of the decriminalisation that has taken place in every state and territory of Australia other than Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At page 1941, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) is recorded as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I will not be opposing the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, I most certainly will not be supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA>At least he has nailed his colours to the mast. But I would have thought that, given his opposition, given the words that he has used, it really is a logical extension that he should exercise his vote one way or the other. That is what amazes me&mdash;that there are people on the other side attempting to sit on the fence. I suggest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in the context of the history of this debate it is a bit rich. That is the problem with the opposition. On many critical issues, it is attempting to have two bob each way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always believed in caucus solidarity, and I do not resile from that. But we have been criticised in this place and around the countryside. We have had held up to us the virtues of the conservative party with the conscience vote. Indeed, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) in her contribution, from which I will quote a bit later, said, `As far as the Liberal Party is concerned, we always have a conscience vote&mdash;and it is the same on this issue.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality is that the kneecappers have been to work on members of the Liberal and National parties imploring those people who hold a genuine view to not even call for a vote. I think it is a bit rich, frankly, for that to be taking place and for the Liberal Party to be attempting to continue to tell us how it is a small `l' Liberal Party, how its members do not like caucusing in the way the Labor Party brings in its people and binds them by a caucus decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have more respect for the honourable member for Braddon, who is merely a shadow minister, if he would be prepared to take his opposition to its natural conclusion and oppose the legislation.

But he should not come in here and try to have two bob each way. It is not as if he is a minister or that he will lose anything. What is he going to lose if he is dumped? A shadow ministry.

But we have someone who is deeply committed to a particular view, who deeply believes in it. What is happening? In his contribution he was unable to oppose the legislation. What a joke. I do not want any lectures from him in future about morality or views that we as individuals should hold, because if he were fair dinkum he would be the one that would be calling for a division on the bill and voting against it.

Some of us have held a view about the Leader of the Opposition for some time. It has been painfully and patently obvious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate today in the debate on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994. Like the member for Banks (Mr Melham), I have listened to many and read all of the contributions made in this place on this bill. I make the point at the outset that this has been one of the rare opportunities, the rare circumstances, where we have had a very real debate on a range of issues concerning a particular piece of legislation in this House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would point out, however, to the member for Banks, whose contribution was largely an attempt at mischief making, that he only confirms my view that the bill itself, the legislation itself, is designed to try to cause disarray on the opposition's side of politics. The reason for that is relatively simple. The Labor Party, the ALP, in government has very firm views. Those views are that one has a vote on issues in caucus and one is then bound by the caucus decision. So the member for Banks's contribution, regardless of what he thinks about this legislation, regardless of whether he supports it or opposes it or falls somewhere in the middle on conflicting ideals, philosophy and practice, makes no difference because at the end of the day he will vote with his party en bloc, en masse, or else he leaves his party and his seat in disgrace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has no choice, no freedom of opportunity, and no ability to come into this place and truly debate ideas, philosophies and opinion. This bill raises a number of issues which are important and a number of matters of principle which I wish to deal with. Firstly, the external affairs power of the constitution was assigned to the Commonwealth. In quite a number of contributions to this debate in this place, members have stated that individual states in our federation have responsibilities but no rights. Section 107 of the constitution states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 108 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every law in force in a Colony which has become or becomes a State, and relating to any matter within the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and, until provision is made in that behalf by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the Colony had until the Colony became a State.</PARA>
<PARA>States do have the right to legislate with respect to those issues which are not specifically vested as powers in the Commonwealth in our constitution. Let us lay that to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) could not directly legislate in this instance in order to invalidate sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. The advice from his advisers and from all the legal fraternity was that he had to find some indirect mechanism. He used the Labor Party option of the external affairs power of the constitution through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in order to validate legislation to override a state law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is wrong in principle. I do not believe that the Commonwealth should override state laws in areas where the states have responsibilities. But I do believe that we need a cooperative federalism. It is an issue that increasingly Australians will debate and discuss as we come closer to entering the 21st century. We must come to grips with the sharing of power, the sharing of responsibilities and how we work together to achieve consensus on truly national issues, yet allow diversity at the state and local government level, which is so important to making our constitution work and to allowing individuals real freedom. In his contribution, the member for Banks demonstrated conclusively that he is of the collective&mdash;he will speak as a member of a collective and vote as  a member of a collective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of politics we believe in the rights of the individual. We believe that the community has responsibilities and that all of us come together to form communities that are important. We need those communities to deliver services to the individual, not to the state itself. We in this place, on this side of politics, make a very real effort to represent our constituencies, to represent those people who ask us to represent them and their views in this place. That is not always easy because, as I have said, there are many conflicting issues and principles involved in this particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need mechanisms devised for the review of treaties and conventions. As many other members have said, there are close to 2,000 treaties or conventions currently in operation which, one way or another, could affect the legal system of both the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the approach under the Fraser government was to reach consensus with the states before signing conventions and treaties, and if consensus could not be reached on any issue, then to put reservations into our ratification of that treaty or convention in favour of a state having the opportunity to make its own decision with regard to that matter. This Labor government has thrown that out the window. With the device that it is using to qualify this piece of legislation under the external affairs power, it took away, as soon as it came to government, the covenants we had placed on that device. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. There is an issue which raises some of my concerns about how we deal with international treaties and conventions. In 1993, I gave in this place a speech about the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and, amongst many other things, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concerns are not for the generality of the convention, which I absolutely and heartily support. The convention is a document which was long years in the making and long years later than it should have had birth. Unfortunately, in a great rush at the end, I believe that those fine gentlemen, the bureaucrats who put together the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, made a few mistakes in English. Those mistakes in English have created great concern in my electorate.</PARA>
<PARA>I then went on to describe problems inherent in some articles of that convention, specifically articles 12 through to 16, which, if read separately from the preamble or article 5 of that convention, could give rise to the occasion where children may be presumed to have rights despite the rights of their parents to give direction, succour and comfort to their own children. I note that recently my concerns appear to be bearing fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received this week information from an organisation called the Oz Child Legal Service. The Oz Child Legal Service has been set up to provide legal advice, representation for court hearings and other legal matters, information referrals to other appropriate services and community legal education services for children. It provides a toll free telephone number for children and young people throughout Victoria to give them greater access to legal services. Its aims are to make the law relevant, accessible and responsive to children and their needs and to promote the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by providing legal advice to children and legal representation for children, and on it goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, I also received this week a communication from the National Children's and Youth Law Centre. It proposes a national children's and young people's legal advocacy program, a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission of the barriers to justice for children, a commissioner for children to monitor and report on the implementation of children's rights, not their responsibilities, and also a charter of children's and young people's rights enacted in Commonwealth legislation. Not once does it mention children's responsibilities and not once does it mention parents, parents' responsibilities or families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While at this juncture I will make no adverse comment about either one of these organisations, I flag the fact that I have serious concerns about them because constituents and friends have come to me and told me about problems they are having with their children. Siblings are sometimes trying to divorce their parents and drag the whole family into a situation only to find out that the dollars of support through the welfare system are insufficient for them to live independent lives and they then wish to rejoin their families. I simply make the point that families have responsibilities, parents have responsibilities and, until children reach the legal age, parents should be allowed and encouraged to nurture their children, support them and give them direction in their own places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my concerns with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child are that we ratified the convention without debate in this place, without discussion in the community. We made it then all-empowering in the Australian legal system without taking into account the deficiencies in language in four of the articles of that convention which worry many parents. I now see that those worries may come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major issue of principle that we deal with in this bill is selective use of conventions by this government. I will give you two examples of that. The first is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20, which deals with freedom of association. I have on two occasions, in 1990-91 and again in 1993, introduced into the House of Representatives an industrial relations bill to guarantee voluntary membership of associations. On one occasion we were allowed to debate the bill. On neither occasion has this parliament ever taken the issue to a vote. This government is not interested in voluntary membership of associations. There is a clear convention, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 20, guaranteeing freedom of association, but this government does not believe that is important enough to ensconce in federal legislation. Do honourable members know why? Because it outlaws compulsory union membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second selective use of conventions concerns the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994, which we debated in this place earlier this year. The Minister for Industrial Relations attempted to use ILO convention 137, signed and ratified in 1974&mdash;20 years ago&mdash;which deals with containerisation on the waterfront, to allow the waterfront  union movement through the finance committee to reintroduce employer levies and pooling of employees, to create once again a register which the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority had attempted to do away with. What happened? The Senate agreed with the opposition that it was an absolutely unconscionable use of the external affairs power of the constitution and a highly selective use of an international convention to try to introduce domestic law in Australia and it overturned it and amended the bill. So the Senate got it right but the minister got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third major issue surrounding this bill is that it gives rise to a de facto bill of rights. I note my extreme concern over a long period of time about codification of rights. The reason for my concern is that, once we write in this place in the English language a right or a responsibility, at some future time future courts which judge the legality or otherwise, the implementation, the application and the practicality of our legislation may make some interpretation of those words that we write today other than we intended. In that regard I refer members to the United States constitution and the first 10 amendments known as the Bill of Rights. In Roe v. Wade, 1973, the Supreme Court of the United States guaranteed abortion rights under the constitution and required that all the states conform. Less than 20 years later, in 1992, the Supreme Court of the United States in the Planned Parenthood v. Casey case, allowed the states to impose restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in the one case, the earlier case, the Supreme Court decided that the Bill of Rights gave rise to a legal right to an abortion and 19 years later it decided it could put restrictions back on that right to a legal abortion. So codification of rights gives us no guarantee of our real rights to privacy, to free speech and to freedom of religion and all those things which we value dearly. The operation of this country has given us the greatest freedoms on earth without codifying rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth issue dealt with by this legislation is sexual conduct. The bill is about sexual conduct. I am no apologist for the homosexual industry, but I recognise and I support their right to do what they will in privacy as long as it does not interfere with someone else's rights or someone else's responsibilities. As a fifth issue, this legislation ensconces a right to privacy. I have explained my reservations about legislating for rights and in this case taking a little portion of a very wide implied document from the United Nations and interpreting it to mean only sexual privacy and using it in this place in order to create a law to override a law in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point about right to privacy and rights in general that laws do not create freedoms; men create freedoms. We create freedoms by our general nature. All laws do is limit freedoms. They apply restrictions to the freedoms that you and I enjoy. I also note in this legislation that the word `arbitrary' is used, and with respect to the right to privacy. I have some concern that at some future time the High Court of this country may judge that word differently from the way this parliament today intends it. I record for posterity my concern that some future justices, well-meaning, may find some different interpretation through the use of the word `arbitrary'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mob on the other side that is bringing this legislation before us today cannot decide what they believe in. The honourable member for Banks accuses us of voicing a wide range of opinions about a wide range of issues, yet I note that the Attorney-General, in the Political Advertising Bill debate in 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are serious about this problem&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and that is the problem of political advertising&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we must ensure that political decisions and governments are formed on the basis of rational debate and not on the basis of the best film clip, as if to say that Madonna is a better artist than Beethoven because her film clips are a bit more interesting and we like the look of them. Those opposite say, `The great rationale behind upholding this important principle of freedom of speech is that you must be able to buy these 30-second grabs because the world is going to fall down if that is not possible'. What absolute lunacy. The political process will be enhanced by this bill, and I ask the House to support it.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: the bill is a bit of mischief, attempting to divide the opposition because we have strongly held beliefs and we make every effort to represent the interests and views of our constituency. On balance I do not oppose the bill. I support absolutely the opposition's amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 has demonstrated the failure of leadership in the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has tried hard but has failed catastrophically to impose his views on the coalition. The Leader of the Opposition said that a conscience vote on this issue would be an abrogation of responsibility and leadership, and he was quite correct. But speaker after speaker in this debate from the opposition has declared that he will vote in defiance of the wishes of the opposition's leadership group. The debate on this bill has left in tatters the moral and leadership authority of the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate the opposition has split in a number of ways. There are those like the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) who best represent the true traditions of liberalism in Australia and support strongly this legislation. There are those like the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), sitting at the table, who represent the authentic voice of conservative libertarianism in this country and who also support the legislation. But there are those like the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) who have openly expressed their opposition to this bill and those who, perhaps most shamefully of all those members, do not want to vote at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has failed the basic test of good government. If it cannot determine a common position on the simple proposition that the state governments have no place in legislating to prohibit sexual activity between consenting adults, how on earth can it be expected to confront the challenges of government? The Leader of the Opposition, in his press conference of 22 September 1994, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think a conscience vote is an abrogation of leadership. I mean it is a non-decision. We're not going to vote against the legislation . . . And I think that is a better outcome for us than sort of floating position where everyone can do as they like.</PARA>
<PARA>But there were problems inherent in the position of the Leader of the Opposition from the moment the evasive position that the opposition would not oppose this legislation was taken. In those words `not oppose', the liberty was taken by so many on the opposition side to avoid the principle of this issue and to avoid the thrust of what is sought to be done by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we could characterise the contributions to this debate in the following way. There are speakers who have indicated plain support for the legislation, and I give them full credit for this. They include: the member for Adelaide; the member for Parkes; the member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly); the member for Aston (Mr Nugent); and, in a very moving contribution this morning, the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there were those who spoke to take the position which had been formally adopted by the opposition.

They were: the member for Braddon (Mr Miles), who said in his contribution that this legislation is `fundamentally un-Australian'; the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who said that he believed it is shameful; and the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who said that he had substantial concerns. Yet, they will, notwithstanding their opposition expressed in debate, proceed to support the proposition that they not oppose the legislation, whatever that might mean. The test of that will come in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had those opposed to the legislation. They were: the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher); the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott); the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford); the member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur); the member for Moore (Mr Filing); and the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). </PARA>

He said that when he visited my state of Tasmania in 1988 he was struck by the feeling of oppression and fear amongst homosexuals in Tasmania. He also said that there was not a single professional working in his field who does not believe that a significant proportion of Tasmanians have moved interstate for treatment and care because of that feeling of oppression and fear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What place is it for the criminal law in our country to create that climate of oppression and fear amongst a group of our community for expressing their sexual preference in the privacy of their own bedrooms? Yet it is precisely the willingness to give comfort to homophobic expressions which in the end colours the views of those who cannot bring themselves to support this legislation or who are actively opposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of Tasmania, these feelings of oppression and fear have been significantly contributed to by the way in which, for example, the member for Braddon has conducted himself in the course of his parliamentary career. He has supported groups like HALO, the Homophobic Activist Liberation Organisation, and Tas Alert, which have consistently opposed law reform which would permit homosexuals in Tasmania to at least not be treated as criminals for the expression of their sexual preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the kind of homophobic views which have been given comfort by the member for Braddon can be seen in a video of the contribution of Mr Richard Gibbs at a forum in which a number of Tasmanian speakers took part last month. In that forum, which was also addressed by a number of speakers, including Michael Kirby and Senator Abetz, Richard Gibbs, speaking for HALO, said that laws against homosexuality were essential. He said, `History has shown that such laws are essential for civilisation.' But the paranoia and the absurd way in which these views are expressed was taken further. He said that homosexuals are not the only group that wants to promote sexual degeneracy. He said that they were part of a Soviet plot to spread disease, to undermine the family and to destroy the social order. He said that it was part of a humanist agenda whose worldwide headquarters is the United Nations and whose aim is that of one world order. The fundamental neo-fascism and the reach of these views is shown by this quote. He said in defence of his views:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One document published in Russia at the turn of the century and reported to be the secret work of Zionists follows the Soviet strategy and actually outlines the deliberate spreading of lies and homosexuality as a means of bringing about the collapse of social order in the west. The book referred to is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The protocol of the elders of Zion</EMPHASIS>. Some of you may have seen it. If you have not I suggest you try to get a copy.</PARA>
<PARA>Those views, which every member of this House, I believe, would reject with contempt, are being expressed by community movements in Tasmania and are being given comfort by the member for Braddon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tas Alert circulated a document from the office of the member for Braddon calling a public meeting. Tas Alert purports to be the more user-friendly face of the homophobic movement in Tasmania. One might expect the Homophobic Activist Liberation Organisation to have a certain colouration of an extremist kind, but Tas Alert is an organisation that the member for Braddon has continually associated himself with. A recent leaflet put out by Tas Alert made a personal attack on Elizabeth Evatt, who is Chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which made the findings that have been the subject of a lot of comment in this debate. That recently circulated leaflet attacked her on the basis that she was the daughter of H.V. Evatt. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr H.V. Evatt was a friend of notorious Communist Harold Laski and was the First Secretary of the United Nations General Assembly chief architect of which was American Communist Alger Hiss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Daughter Elizabeth, Chairman of the United Nations Human Rights Committee has been instrumental in the Toonen Homosexual Case providing the wedge by which the Socialist Labour Party may override all State Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like Father Like Daughter</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their allegiance to foreign Socialists and subversive attempts to centralise foreign policy in Canberra are a disgrace to every free thinking Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>What a disgraceful performance, but, more importantly, how factually incorrect. First, Elizabeth Evatt is not the daughter of H.V. Evatt. Second, Harold Laski was a friend of Evatt but he was Chairman of the British Labour Party and professor of government at the London School of Economics. He was definitely never a communist. Hiss was not the architect of the United Nations. Indeed, there is no evidence at all of Evatt having corresponded with or ever meeting Hiss. Finally, Evatt was never secretary of the United Nations. He was in fact President of the General Assembly in 1948, but he was not the first but indeed the third president. He was the first English speaking president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Braddon uses his electoral allowance to send out leaflets promoting the views of Tas Alert and promoting rallies like Stand Up for Tasmania, which was organised by Tas Alert. What is the personal view of the honourable member for Braddon? His own views are as extreme as those of Tas Alert and HALO. At a public meeting in Ulverstone in 1991, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act of homosexuality is unacceptable in any society, let alone a civilised society.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that not echo precisely what a Homophobic Activist Liberation Organisation speaker, Mr Gibbs, said in his comments? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">History has shown such laws are essential for civilisation.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Braddon really has a question to answer here. He says that laws criminalising homosexual behaviour are essential for civilisation. He also says that he is a person of principle. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Tasmanian </EMPHASIS>of 19 July this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are too many people who put their finger up to see which way the wind is blowing and move that way . . . what people want is leadership and you need to let them know your beliefs to be an effective member of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>In that article, the honourable member for Braddon said that in the end he would answer to God, not the party or the people. As <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Examiner </EMPHASIS>of 17 August stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was all before Mr Miles became the Shadow Minister for Schools. Now he has something to lose and the decision isn't so clear cut.</PARA>
<PARA>Watch him wriggle. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Advocate </EMPHASIS>of 27 September this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposed Federal legislation had overridden the code, I would vote against it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the proposed Federal legislation stands, it does not override Tasmanian law. Sexual practices such as sodomy as covered by the Tasmanian Criminal Code will remain a criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA>What an puerile attempt to avoid the logic of the situation he is facing. The fact that these laws plainly override the Tasmanian criminal code is given testimony to by Senator Abetz. In his briefing paper to opposition members earlier this month, Senator Abetz asked this question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 override Tasmanian law?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Abetz continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Propaganda&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not referring, of course, to his colleague the honourable member for Braddon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has been peddled that this move by the Federal Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch, was clever and smart, and somehow it does not override Tasmanian law . . . The High Court will look behind the legislation and ask the intention of the legislation. The intention is quite clear. It is designed to override Tasmania's laws.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Braddon has no credibility in this matter. He has been the prime organiser of opposition to any reform of Tasmania's criminal laws. Through his office, he has distributed the most extreme propaganda and anti-homosexual literature. He is now confronted by a clash between two principles: will he remain true to the principles that he has espoused for many years in his electorate and oppose the bill&mdash;he said he would oppose the bill if it overrode the Tasmanian laws, which it does&mdash;or will he try to weasel out?</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is that he is now talking of abstaining from the vote. He is simply unable to face one of those difficult choices we face from time to time in politics: do you abandon your principles or your front bench position? The honourable member for Braddon can run but he cannot hide. There is no right to privacy in casting a vote in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fundamental question here. The honourable member for Parkes has made a very reasoned contribution to this debate. However, one point he raised needs a specific response. He asked why the Labor government, when in government in Tasmania, did not repeal these very laws. The honourable member for Curtin implied the same by arguing that the Tasmanian House of Assembly was more democratic in its formulation than was the House of Representatives. The truth is that the democratic House of Assembly in Tasmania did try to pass legislation which would have overridden these laws. In December 1990, the Tasmanian Labor government introduced legislation to repeal the offending provisions. It was passed by the lower house but rejected by the gerrymandered upper house&mdash;an upper house whose malapportionment of seats is such that the seat of Gordon has in the order of 6,000 electors and the seat of Pembroke has in the order of 26,000 electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the end the point is this: we have to deal with the situation where, daily, people in my state of Tasmania whose sexual preference is not that shared by the majority of Australians have their privacy invaded. The honourable member for Braddon is at least right about one thing in relation to this debate: laws do have an educative effect. They tell homosexual men in Tasmania that they are criminals. They tell the Tasmanian community that homosexuals are second-class citizens. Those laws intrude into every aspect of the private life of homosexual men. The threat of the criminal law is an invasion in itself. It affects the way people live their lives. If the criminal law is not intended to affect the way people live their lives, then why are these laws still on the statute book?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to where I started. I understand that in an interview this morning the Leader of the Opposition said that he expects those on the coalition side, should this issue come to a vote, to actually support this legislation. That was the principled position that should have been adopted in the first place. There should have been clear and unambiguous support of this legislation. I respect the views of those who hold a different position but I disagree with them profoundly. The honourable member for Braddon should lose his position on the front bench, not because he expressed a position of conscience but because he has an intolerance which no opposition frontbencher or government frontbencher should share. There is no room for such intolerance by those who speak on behalf of either the government or the shadow government of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While masquerading as champions of the individual, this Labor government&mdash;facilitated by the unelected and unaccountable judges of the High Court&mdash;is proceeding to tear up the Australian constitution as we have understood it since 1901. In doing so, it is seeking to overturn the criminal law in Tasmania, regardless of what the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has said. In this nation, criminal law has traditionally been the responsibility of the states. I personally believe that that position should remain. Therefore, I am taking the stand I am on this particular piece of legislation because I am opposed to the federal government's abuse of the external affairs power, as revealed by the speeches of government members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I cannot support the government in its cynical legislative manoeuvre.

The government's real motive is to expose varying views on our side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition of Liberal and National parties prides itself on being a broad church. On some issues we celebrate our unity through diversity. One of the great strengths of conservative politics in Australia is that our members of parliament are not puppets; they are allowed to think. They are elected by their constituents to represent their electorates and to cast a considered vote on any issue. We are mostly of one mind but on difficult issues, such as that posed by the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994, the views of our members undoubtedly have varying emphases. The ALP treats its members as hacks. We have seen situation after situation where government members have objected to what the government is doing but, because of ALP discipline, they have not been allowed to express dissent in this forum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Watson. I thank you for the correction, Mr Deputy Speaker, although I am quite certain that the Chief Government Whip was not at all offended by my comment on his athletic prowess. The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), as first speaker for the opposition in this debate, pointed out that, as a coalition, we have a very high respect for the principle of privacy. He stated that, in our law and justice policy at the last election, we included the words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition puts a high priority on the right to privacy, especially the right to privacy against government. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the coalition had a very difficult job when discussing this bill. On the one hand, we had to consider our very strong support for the principle of privacy and, on the other hand, we had to look at the very cynical exercise of the government in seeking to tear up the constitution by using a very broad interpretation of the external affairs power. That was the dilemma that we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The external affairs power was put in the constitution when Australia became a nation. Quite appropriately, it was understood that matters of an external and international nature should be handled by the federal government. Traditionally, there has not really been a problem with this. But, in recent times, an ever-widening interpretation of the external affairs power has meant that, in effect, the federal government is now able to enter into a treaty on any subject matter with any country. The Commonwealth is thus empowered to legislate, through this parliament, on the implementation of a treaty, regardless of the situation under the Australian constitution and regardless of the normal responsibilities of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon our return to government, we will have to address this glaring problem. It is a problem which is reducing our constitution to a sham because the Commonwealth is now able to rule on any matter. When I went to law school, it was clear that at the time of Federation certain powers were given to the Commonwealth and that the remainder of the powers rested with the states. Following these ever-widening interpretations on the part of the High Court, there is clearly a problem which even the government admits. The question is, however: how is it going to be addressed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem could be corrected if the High Court restricted its wide interpretation of the external affairs power. Given the current make-up of the High Court, it is unlikely that we will see that occur in the near future. This parliament could arguably pass an act which would restrict the ability of the executive to enter into treaties. It is unfortunate that, at present, most treaties are entered into simply by the executive. I understand that there is not usually even a full discussion of these matters at cabinet meetings, and the decision to sign and ratify is often made by the Executive Council, comprising the Governor-General and two ministers. It is of concern when such an important power is allocated to so few people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem could also be addressed by a constitutional amendment by virtue of complementary legislation between the Commonwealth and the various state parliaments. But, given the nature of Australian politics and given the varying compositions of parliaments in Australia, that might be a difficult aim as one might find it hard to gain a unanimous point of view right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on all sides of politics are concerned at the impact on our constitution of the wide interpretation of the external affairs power. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that a future coalition government could sit down with state governments of both political colours and say, `Look, we've got this major hiccup in the way that our constitution is now operating and we have to solve it; is this a viable option?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last way that this problem could be addressed is by a constitutional amendment with a referendum put to the Australian people. But, with the current reluctance of the Australian people to pass constitutional referenda, that might be a rather difficult way to implement this important change to the constitution. From my point of view, it is unfortunate that it would be difficult to gain a majority of people in a majority of states, as well as an overall majority, on a constitutional question of this nature. However, the reluctance to pass constitutional referenda is going to thwart this government when it ultimately seeks to turn Australia into a republic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting observation is that, whenever politicians ask for constitutional changes, the people of Australia are somewhat suspicious. With the cynical exercise of the Attorney-General and the government in bringing in this particular bill, is it any wonder that the Australian people are very concerned about the attitudes of politicians? We on our side of the parliament therefore have had a fairly difficult job in deciding our party political position on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The human discovery of the conditions of community and citizenship are equivalent as advances in knowledge to any of the great discoveries in physics. Like the common law, physics didn't just drop out of the sky. The idea that the relations of things are governed by laws that can be known but the relations (in community) of humans are not is mere superstition.</PARA>
<PARA>The important point he makes which impinges on this subject is that he believes it is strongly arguable that, even without this law, the existing law in Tasmania may be struck down by the additions to the common law as a result of the recent decisions of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very simple matter for me to say on that basis that I do not want to remove gays in Tasmania from the community. I do not want to discriminate against them. Quite clearly, this parliament could not. The Fraser government signed the treaty which gives us the enabling authority to place this law before the Australian parliament, and on that basis I support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise but briefly to participate in this debate on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I guess any comments at this stage in the debate from anyone on any side of the House are bound to be repetitious because all that needs to be said has been said. In a synopsis, much of what I feel about this legislation has already been said by the members for Tangney (Mr Williams), Parkes (Mr Cobb) and Fisher (Mr Slipper).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was in the chair when the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) participated in this debate. He was at some pains to indicate to the House that he felt that the legislation was doing nothing more than guaranteeing the privacy to which he felt he should be entitled, as a husband, to engage in any sort of permissible sexual activity with his wife. While I sat in the chair, the member for Gilmore was clearly anxious to titillate the parliament. He was hoping that some of us in the opposition would in some way be discomforted by what he had to say. The simple reality is that, in my view, he missed precisely what this debate is all about. I have heard no-one on any side of the chamber at any time in this debate indicate that he or she, in any sense, wants to intrude on the rights of individuals to engage in legal activity in private. I have not seen the matter of privacy arise in this debate as an issue that is causing any one of us any angst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, everyone in this House recognises the rights of individuals to engage in legal activity in private. It was in that context that I felt the member for Gilmore had failed to embrace the entire range of what this debate was all about. He was not alone. In common with every other member in the parliament, I have been lobbied by a number of single issue groups which I am sure are well intentioned but which see this legislation as in some ways giving additional rights to Tasmanians, particularly homosexuals, to which they are not entitled. I think they have misrepresented what the legislation is about because, fundamentally, the legislation in my view does nothing more than say, `If the activity that you are engaged in is legal, you are entitled to be engaged in it in private. If that activity does not occur between consenting adults and is not a legal activity, then clearly no-one in society intends to protect or give people an opportunity to engage in illegal activities in private.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find, frankly, that no-one in the National Party, the Liberal Party or the parliament has challenged the right of individuals to privacy. Some activities that people engage in may be viewed by others as immoral, but that is not the purpose of the parliament. The purpose of the parliament is to determine what is legal and then to appropriately enforce or amend those laws. For me, the right to privacy poses no problems at all, and in that context&mdash;in the context of the right to privacy&mdash;I could not oppose the legislation currently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this legislation has been designed principally to pose a problem for the opposition. In many ways, the difficulties that opposition members have referred to over and again have had nothing to do with what has been an attack on us about our attitude to privacy but a great deal to do with what we see as the principal role of the federation and of what is popularly called states rights. My own view is that, whatever is wrong with the law in Tasmania, Tasmanians can sort it out. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), as a Tasmanian, and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) may well want to remind me that the Tasmanians have failed to sort it out so they felt an obligation to act on behalf of all Australians. Frankly, I do not share that sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in Tasmania the Minister for Justice, as a Tasmanian, gets only one vote, but it has precisely the same impact as the vote of any other Tasmanian. If, as I suspect, the Attorney-General genuinely feels that the Tasmanian government has failed in its responsibility, as the member for Wakefield my reaction to that is inclined to be, `That may be; nonetheless, it is in the hands of the Tasmanians to do something about it.' At that point, I find myself unable to support the legislation simply because, in my view, whatever the faults, the Tasmanians have the power to sort it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a lawyer and am not in a position to comment&mdash;the Attorney-General may want to comment on this matter&mdash;but it may well be that, as the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) has said, the High Court has already set a precedent that will oblige the Tasmanian government to do something. I am not in a position to comment on that, but I recognise that every Tasmanian has the right to do something about whatever is seen to be wrong in Tasmania. That is a right I do not want to take from them or intrude on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the way in which this legislation is alleged to have split the opposition. I noticed, when the member for Fisher made his remarks, that they were greeted with levity from the government back bench and also the front bench. I think that was a little unkind. I think the member for Fisher was well intentioned; he was prepared to stand up and declare to his electorate that he would be accountable for what he was doing. He was not pretending that he would be on an overseas delegation or not about, and he was entitled to recognition for standing up and declaring his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not feel, as a member of this opposition&mdash;and have never felt in 11 years in this place&mdash;dictated to by the party room. The thing that I most resent is the degree to which I am dictated to by the press gallery. Mischief will be made of whatever is done today. There will not be a genuine effort to portray the heart-searching that has gone on on the opposition benches and maybe on the government benches as well. I can speak authoritatively only about the opposition benches. I recognise, as every member of the opposition does, the right of every Australian to engage in a legal activity in private. What I cannot condone is the right of the Commonwealth government to intrude on what is a relatively&mdash;I use the word cautiously in terms of the total spectrum of government affairs&mdash;incidental exercise in Tasmania, a matter that I believe the Tasmanians have at their fingertips the power to sort out for themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with a number of the comments made by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), one of which was that this has been a very long and fulsome debate. I will not keep the House long in terms of recanvassing issues which have been debated fully by many members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address a few of the fundamental and constant themes expounded by many speakers in this debate. Firstly, let us understand that this bill is about human rights. It is based on the same constitutional authority as all other Commonwealth legislation in relation to human rights&mdash;that is, the external affairs power of the constitution; putting into domestic law that part of our international obligations that is necessary to fulfil our human rights obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a matter of great moment for many in the opposition that somehow the reliance on and use of the external affairs power are being used in such a way as to essentially destroy or attack the federal-state balance or things of that nature. I do not believe that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must understand some fundamental points here. The constitution itself contains this power. It was not placed in the constitution in recent times; it is part of it. Obviously, a fundamental reason for federation is that the Australian people should speak internationally with one voice. The same constitution establishes the High Court and vests in that court the responsibility of determining questions in relation to the extent of Commonwealth power, the interpretation of the constitution. The High Court again has played that role since its inception, as prescribed by the Australian constitution. So there is nothing new or novel in this power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is then suggested that the High Court has in recent times embarked on a new interpretation of the external affairs power. There is no doubt that the external affairs power has been developed over time. However, as early as 1936 it was quite clear, through a number of judgments handed down by the court&mdash;for example, in the case of Burgess ex parte Henry&mdash;that the Commonwealth, through the external affairs power, did very well have the scope to put into domestic law Australia's international obligations. That has then been a power which governments of both political persuasions have relied on over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is indeed ironic that the very covenant upon which a large part of our human rights legislation is based, with the use then of the external affairs power, is the covenant on civil and political rights which was ratified by the Fraser government. It was the Fraser government which used the power to establish the Human Rights Commission in this country in its earlier form. So the Fraser government and Liberal-National party governments have relied on the external affairs power. It is quite extraordinary that we now seem to think this presents us with some great difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incorporation into domestic law of international processes is hardly something which is new, nor has it largely been controversial. Shortly this House will be debating the question of GATT legislation. This is Australia putting into domestic laws our obligations which we have agreed to under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In fact, in reality, the impact on Australian lives, on the Australian nation, of this international embodiment into domestic law of international obligations will be far greater than this particular piece of legislation, yet I do not think we will probably get quite the same enthusiasm or conspiratorial theories expounded or one-world government undertones which we have heard in a lot of the contributions throughout this debate, including some contributions in this parliament. So that again faces the reality that Australia is part of the world and this parliament forms part of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also brings up very many fundamental questions about the position of human rights versus states rights. The line expounded by and a common theme coming through from a number of speakers in the opposition is that we should be more concerned about the rights of the Australian states and their legislative power than about human rights. This legislation has been described as `a grab for power by Canberra'. `Another example of creeping centralism' was the expression used by the member for Moore (Mr Filing). Yet, fortunately, we did have more balanced views expressed by members of the opposition. The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we have always said the states should have primary rights in traditional state areas, we cannot overlook the fact that federally we have international obligations. We cannot opt out of living up to them because one or other of the states does not like it. We are not merely empty vessels for the states.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a view which has been expressed by different members of the opposition. But the fundamental point, of course, is this: it is individuals who have rights; it is individuals whose rights parliamentarians, parliaments and governments should be interested in protecting. It is not the rights and powers of governments which really we should think are placed higher than that of individuals. I do not believe that is a terribly controversial proposition. I think that would be generally supported by members across the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we then get down to this second level of argument where people say, `Well, I accept that, but the Tasmanian people have voted for a government, for a parliament, which has decided on a particular course of action. We as individuals may not agree with that, but that's a matter for that parliament.' Tasmanians as well as Australians living in all other states have voted, of course, for a federal government and for a federal parliament as well. This federal parliament also has the right to make determinations and judgments on issues of human rights. It is this parliament which is being asked to make such a judgment on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as the mandate arguments can be advanced on behalf of the Tasmanian government&mdash;that is, if the people do not like the decision made by their representatives on the particular provisions of the criminal code, then let them be voted out at the next election&mdash;I can say exactly the same thing: if people do not like the decision of the Commonwealth government on this legislation, if they do not like the decision we are asking the parliament of Australia to make, let them vote us out also on this issue at the next election. That is the difficulty with these mandate arguments&mdash;they only take you so far. That is why our constitution recognises that inevitably there will be occasions where there are differences of view, differences in laws, between the Commonwealth and the states. That is why the constitution prescribes through section 109 that, in the case of conflict between a Commonwealth and a state law, it is Commonwealth law which is to prevail. That is the constitutional decision which our founders made. That is the way conflicts between Commonwealth and state laws have always been determined. At the end of the day, even though you may try to clothe this in rhetoric of states rights, it is a completely circular argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament has just as much right&mdash;if you are going to talk in terms of rights&mdash;to make legislation, to make a decision, to make a judgment, as does the Tasmanian parliament. If there is a conflict between the two matters, then the Commonwealth law prevails. That is not different because it is a power based on the external affairs power or putting into Australian law international obligations. If any of the GATT legislation, which this parliament will soon decide, is contradictory to the law of contract which is under the domain of state governments, if it is contradictory to the law of liability or tort which is largely under the domain of state governments, the Commonwealth legislation regarding the implementation of our GATT obligations will override the inconsistent state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But will we get members of the opposition railing against this? Will we say, `This is an attack upon our constitutional framework'? Will we see this as destruction of the federal and state balance? I do not think we will. I think we will probably get some broad support for the implementation of international GATT obligations into Australian domestic law, notwithstanding whatever impact it may have on state laws or on traditional so-called state responsibilities in the area of contract in tort. Yet suddenly we have this great hang-up about the area of criminal law. Criminal law has never been solely a responsibility of state governments. We have, and have had for many decades, the Commonwealth Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Kerr interjecting&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Justice points out, we have had very strong support from the opposition&mdash;and I commend the opposition for this&mdash;for the passing recently through both houses of legislation designed to combat the activities of Australians involved in paedophilia overseas, the child sex legislation, which was a bipartisanly supported measure. This is again legislation which is based on our international obligations and putting an obligation into domestic law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us strip away all this meaningless rhetoric. Let us look at the reality. What we should be interested in is the interests of individuals, the interests of human rights&mdash;not the power balance of governments. Surely we are not so het up with our own power, drunk with the responsibilities of being politicians, that we forget we are not here to talk about power battles between governments. At the end of the day, surely we are here to look after and be mindful of the rights of our citizens, the rights of the individuals that we represent. That is the fundamental point here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had a range of discussions about the way in which the Commonwealth enters into treaties. That is a legitimate enough debate. Of course it is. People can have differing views about what processes should be employed in relation to the Commonwealth entering into treaties. Let us get a couple of the fundamentals at least understood and restated. Firstly, under the constitution it was a power given to the Commonwealth. The same constitution, under section 61, describes it as an executive function. So that is the starting point for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is an agreed set of principles which operate between the Commonwealth and the states in relation to the entry of treaties. These principles and arrangements were agreed upon, in their most recent form, substantially again by the Fraser government in 1977. There has been some change to them, but there has been no change to the substance of them. They were most recently reconfirmed by both the states and the Commonwealth in, I think, 1992. Those are agreed sets of principles that are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this scheme, this set of principles, there is established at the Commonwealth and state level a treaties committee, the job of which is to meet to examine treaties which the nation is considering, which it is involved in negotiations on, or about which it is pondering whether ratification should proceed. As well as that, individual ministerial forums discuss and consider the terms of individual treaties. Matters of human rights, such as this matter, go before the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Those structures are already in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite almost then miss the point. They say, `In the United States, there has to be the approval of the Congress before the government&mdash;the executive, the President&mdash;can go off signing treaties, and we should have a similar process here.' That misses the point that, under American law, treaties are generally self-executing; that is, upon signing, they become part of American domestic law. Common law countries, Westminster countries, such as Australia, have a different system. There is no direct impact on domestic law by the signing of a treaty. Rather, it has to be through an action of a parliament that a treaty implication becomes part of domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this great debate about the involvement of parliament in the treaty process and here we are, sitting here today, being part of the parliamentary involvement of the treaty process, that is, taking part in the discussion of the legislation which is putting part of a treaty into domestic law. It is an absurd argument to say that there should be greater levels of parliamentary involvement. What greater level of parliamentary involvement can you get in a process than having a bill that has to be put, debated and passed by both houses of parliament? There is not some rinky-dink little committee looking at this bill and making a determination. It has to be passed by both houses of parliament. What greater parliamentary involvement is required? Of course, that argument is an absurd argument. It is advanced by people who do not understand the process, or who do not want to understand the process, or who deliberately try to misrepresent the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get away from these things which in a sense are almost side issues and look at the provisions of the bill. A range of somewhat bizarre arguments was advanced. I suppose the member taking the cake would have to be the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Because the words `sexual conduct' are mentioned in the bill, his interpretation of that means that it has anything to do with sex organs. As a result, through his rather tortured reasoning, he believes it is possible that somehow this bill could give comfort or protection to those who may, for instance, be contemplating female genital mutilation. This comes within his definition of sexual conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is my advice to the people of Australia: `Never go out on a date with the member for O'Connor.' His version of what sexual conduct is would make me run a thousand miles away. He is entitled to his view, but I would rather refer him to a more thoughtful contribution on the impact of the bill by the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) who concluded that that sort of nonsense was exactly that&mdash;nonsense. This bill will not impact on laws governing children or on laws governing incest. It does not deal with acts done in public. It does fundamentally look after the interests of private citizens. The issues have been well canvassed. I urge the House to strongly support&mdash;not just not oppose&mdash;this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of legislation implements Australia's commitment to the World Trade Organisation or, if you like, the outcome of the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Similar legislation to that which is being debated in Australia is being put before the parliaments of about 120 other countries. Of particular concern to Australia is what legislation is put before and passed by the parliaments of the European Union, the United States and Japan. Obviously, there is concern that those major powers adhere to the spirit of the Uruguay Round agreement. In my view, what is happening in the European Union at the present time is just as negative or potentially negative as what is happening in the United States. If all parties pass this legislation, it will be a most significant achievement for world trade, and this will include Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, I have been critical of the way the Australian government has unilaterally reduced tariffs ahead of all other countries and therefore reduced or removed any leverage we would have in the hard bargaining process of the Uruguay Round. The reason it did this was, first of all, that, as initial chairman of the Cairns Group, it wanted to be seen to be purer than any other country. More realistically, without the government's ability to bring about a more competitive and efficient industry in Australia by labour market reform, the only way it could do it was indirectly through tariff reductions. I also believe the government relied too much on the multilateral agreement and was too slow negotiating bilateral agreements, particularly with our Asian neighbour countries, for better access to those very closed markets. Having said that, I commend this government and those other governments who were members of the Cairns Group for what they have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of two bipartisan delegations&mdash;one to the European Union and one to the United States&mdash;that looked at the progress of the Uruguay Round. I fully support the continuation of the Cairns Group and Australia remaining chair. After two tours of a number of Latin American countries over the last two years, it is obvious that the better relationship that we have with those countries stems to a great degree from the better understanding and feelings that were created by so many of those countries in that part of world being part of the Cairns Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been projections about who will be the winners and who will be the losers. As a result of the Uruguay Round, it is generally conceded that in Australia the big winners in agriculture are beef, dairy and grain producers, particularly wheat producers. All the projections indicated increased prices, increased production and increased exports. Amongst the losers are some horticultural industries. The citrus industry has been rightly mentioned in this debate because less than adequate attention has been given to the problems of that industry by the government in changes to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to remind members that the citrus industry is not the only horticultural industry that has been a loser as a result of this process. I refer to the deciduous canned fruit industry which has also been a loser. If one goes back a few years, the tariff advantage Australia traditionally had with Canada under the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement, stemming back to the days of empire preference, was removed or phased out over a period of years and preference, if you like, for Californian canned fruit was advanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commitment was made by the then Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Hawke, that Australia's canned fruit industry would not be disadvantaged and the situation would be corrected. Nothing happened as a result of negotiations with Canada, but the commitment was made that it would be sorted out in the Uruguay Round. It has not been. It means that Australia's largest export market for canned fruit is at grave risk as the advantage moves in favour of California and away from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one talks about the winners, much will depend on what finally happens with policies in the United States, the European Union and Japan and the access provided to the growing markets in Asia. Generally, it will be the year 2000 before there is any significant improvement for those particular industries. In the meantime, drought and increasing domestic costs could further reduce the ability of those industries to be winners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have higher domestic costs than many of our competitors. With the drought now in its fourth year in some parts of Australia, it is particularly tragic that the grain industry&mdash;whether it is wheat, or barley for the growing production of beer around the Pacific Rim&mdash;will fail to maintain and develop markets, and that the beef industry, with the rapid expansion of the feedlot industry and value adding, will be unable to continue its advances into a number of Asian countries. If the drought moves further south, the dairy industry could be the next of that winning group to suffer as a result of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to refer specifically to two sections of the legislation. Firstly, I refer to the dairy industry and the role it plays in Australia. I declare an interest in the dairy industry as I, together with my bank manager, own a dairy farm. Secondly, I will refer to the anti-dumping section of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dairy is quoted as being one of the major winners. The dairy industry is winning now, but it is not a miraculous or easy win because the price that dairy farmers are receiving for their exported product is less than last year and less than two years ago. They are winning to a certain extent because of the European Union's policies and because rising living standards around the Pacific Rim are requiring greater consumption of dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the major reason why the dairy industry is well placed, with increased exports and increased value adding of those exports, is that the dairy industry has had to rationalise more over the last 20 years than any other industry in Australia. It has suffered unfair international competition for a longer period and to a greater degree than any other industry in Australia. It goes back to the early 1970s, with the UK entry to the European Community. The European Union, in particular, over the 20 years since then has been a provider of production, of processing and finally of exporting subsidies. Those export subsidies have quite often amounted to over 100 per cent of the price. Compare that to, say, grain. Only since the US Farm Bill of 1985 has there been significant export subsidisation of grain. Generally it has been no more than, say, 40 to 50 per cent of the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this severe and harsh rationalisation, which has been gained at great pain for those who have been forced out of industry, and for that matter those who have remained in the industry&mdash;because of the reduced standard of living they have had to suffer to stay in the industry&mdash;Australia has gained a great competitive edge, along with New Zealand, the other low cost dairy exporting nation. I represent the Goulburn Valley, the largest concentration of the dairy industry for export of anywhere in Australia. Even in southern Australia the dairy industry has not had some of the advantages of New Zealand. The New Zealanders have continued to have access to the European Community's high priced domestic market and through their domestic pooling arrangements have been able to add to the prices of their producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have the same natural advantage of New Zealand, which can grow grass for more months of the year than anywhere else in the world with a temperate climate. However, I believe that advantage is now declining because in New Zealand they are recognising that if you are only going to milk cows for eight or nine months of the year you have very expensive capital tied up both in your farm and your factory which is not being fully utilised. As the genetic potential of your herd increases, the ability to profitably feed grain to further add to that production becomes more and more obvious. New Zealanders do not have the source of cheap grain that we now have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand also has a VAT, or GST, which reduces the cost to its domestic producers and gives them an export subsidy. Our market support arrangements are now being terminated. I believe they will be replaced, ironically by a GST type scheme because GST or VAT schemes are the only form of GATT legal export subsidies. It is disappointing to me that the New Zealand government is making threats at present to try to prevent the replacement legislation treating the Australian dairy industry in the way it should be treated, and that is providing through the system some advantage for the local industry, so that the industry in New Zealand has less of the free ride that both New Zealand and the European Union have had with regard to the way their products have been promoted freely&mdash;freely for them but at a cost to the Australian dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand's threat about flooding the Australian domestic market because there are no anti-dumping provisions between our two countries is absurd. We could do more to harm New Zealand in international markets as New Zealand is a bigger exporter than we are. The time has come for the government to stand up to New Zealand and say: `What do you do for us with regard to access to your markets? We want to play fair and positive by the dairy industry in Australia with the new legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expansion of the dairy industry has been particularly dramatic in Victoria. It has been expanding at seven per cent a year now for quite a few years, with the greatest consistent productivity increase of any industry in Australia. We are now up to about $1.2 billion in exports. In spite of the drought and the dry conditions, production will be well over eight billion litres this year. In Victoria, at least, production this year so far is at least 10 per cent ahead of last year. There has been well over $500 million of investment on dairy farms in the last few years and an even higher figure than that in our factories&mdash;a good percentage of that in the major dairy factories in my area. More will be needed, particularly to  handle the increasing problem of effluent, as factory production increases and tighter environmental restraints come into place with regard to the discharge of effluent, particularly through the irrigation areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the ironic situation of an actual shortage of product for export. This means that some of the lower priced markets will miss out this year. That will be unfortunate if it includes some of the new Latin American markets which have been developed in the last few years. The major exporter processor factories in my area, such as Bonlac, Murray Goulburn, Kraft and Nestle, have put a ban on any new suppliers this year partly because they have a 10 per cent internal growth or productivity increase of their own suppliers. By itself it is difficult to maintain the capital investment needed to handle that, particularly to value add. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a problem. The member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) referred to it to a certain extent in the debate yesterday. Some old factories are having to stay open to handle the dramatic increase in production. They have a problem because there is no doubt that dairy production can increase dramatically in southern Australia. But they are most uncertain as to how much they should be investing partly because of uncertainty over what the United States, and particularly what the European Union, will do and partly because of the uncertainty here as to what this government will do when the challenge comes of replacing the legislation that we are terminating in this debate with what the dairy industry has been promised&mdash;equivalent legislation that is GATT legal. That legislation is absolutely essential if the stability and confidence of that industry, which is advancing at a faster rate in exports of value added products from Australia than any other industry to my knowledge, are to be maintained and if that investment is to take place so that extra dairy farms can be allowed to come into the system and extra processing facilities can be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market support scheme that is being terminated has provided some stability and security to allow this investment to take place, to develop these export markets. I am disappointed on behalf of the dairy farmers whom I represent that that problem is not being addressed in this legislation. I acknowledge that there is a clause in the bill which would indicate that the current scheme will continue beyond 1 July, if necessary, until such time as the World Trade Organisation comes into being. But surely there should have been another clause put in saying that the current scheme will also continue until equivalent legislation is put in place. That would have provided the security for the industry to go out even harder to invest than is currently the situation. That is why an amendment will be moved by the opposition in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is gravely concerned that this legislation is being terminated ahead of the introduction of the GATT Legal replacement legislation, which will be needed to ensure confidence and investment is maintained in the Australian dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope the government does quickly move to give that confidence to the dairy industry so that this great development can continue. Another important element of the legislation is making our anti-dumping and countervailing legislation consistent with that part of the GATT round. The advice we have been given is that it is mainly for clarification, definition, transparency and, hopefully, uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that other countries party to the GATT will legislate similarly. I have some knowledge of the way the United States handles its anti-dumping and countervailing operations. It may be using the same GATT text that we are, but it certainly interprets it differently. I support the comments made by the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) that, to a certain extent, it is a question of the attitude of those authorities concerned about this to see that we do have a better balance between those who are allegedly dumping product here or who are benefiting from export subsidisation to give better equality to Australian industries that are being put at risk. Australia is the sufferer of more dumped processed food products than any other country in the world, simply because we have the most open access arrangements for those products of any country in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bills we are dealing with all revolve around the World Trade Organisation and contain changes to different aspects of the way we do things in this country. Over the last few years there has been a fairly tense debate across Australia on what we as a nation should be doing as far as tariff protection, industry support and the direction in which we should be going are concerned. Those issues were highlighted at the last election and are certainly being addressed in these bills, which will have a profound effect on what happens in Australia, particularly with agriculture, for many years to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the countries that have agreed to the signing of the GATT agreement have actually signed the document. The signing of the GATT agreement is a milestone in world trade. Understandably, sections of our community, the manufacturing industries and the primary industries, are still quite sceptical as to the outcome. The benefits that we are told will flow to a lot of these industries are yet to be proven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill I focus on today is the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. Since the mid-1980s the dairy industry has benefited from stabilisation plans that have been put into place. The industry has self-funded its support mechanism as far as the sale of milk on the domestic market and the support of export products are concerned. It has been a highly successful scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent the mid-north coast of New South Wales and the dairy industry has for many years been the key primary industry in the electorate of Lyne. It is little wonder that the producers operating within that industry are a little sceptical about being left in limbo between when we do away with this legislation with the all milk levy, which has provided that mechanism for the stability of the dairy industry over the last eight or nine years since it came into being, and when a replacement mechanism or subsidy that is GATT friendly is put into place. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), foreshadowed the amendment which is proposed to be moved at the appropriate time. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is gravely concerned that this legislation is being terminated ahead of the introduction of the GATT legal replacement legislation which will be needed to ensure confidence and investment is maintained in the Australian dairy industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Confidence is the most important thing&mdash;confidence for producers to go on and invest and plan for the future of their operations. These operations are not small by any means these days. A great rationalisation has taken place in the dairy industry right across Australia and there are many hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, invested in each individual operation. That is all swinging in the breeze at this stage. It might be all right for the people involved in the drafting of this legislation, the people involved in the negotiations as far as GATT or the World Trade Organisation is concerned, and the people still involved in the discussion as to what form the replacement mechanism is going to take, but it is little consolation for the dairy farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases at the moment, particularly throughout New South Wales and particularly in my electorate, the dairy industry is facing a very grave situation with the drought, with the lack of available stock and domestic water and the scarcity of feed. We saw in the media this morning and last night that the government is taking measures to try to ascertain the amount of feed still available in Australia. We are facing the prospect of importing feed and grain from overseas to make the bare essentials of life, such as bread, to feed the Australian population. We are confronted with a very grave situation with the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, this industry is facing up to the situation outlined in this legislation. We flag to the parliament and the government that the situation being created may cause doubt about whether that confidence can continue through this process. I add that the dairying industry has placed a great deal of trust in the government so far in the process that is taking place. We have not seen lots of protests or comment in the media, so the industry seems to be trusting that the government will deliver. We certainly hope that it does and that it delivers a mechanism that sees the dairy industry trade on past the year 2000 as the dynamic industry that it has become. That has been a lesson to a lot of the other primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the bill do? It terminates the market support payments to the Australian dairy industry to comply with Australia's GATT requirements. As I said at the start of my comments, it is interesting to note, and it will be interesting to note in future, the countries that are fair dinkum, that follow up on these negotiations and that make domestic commitments as far as subsidies and support schemes are concerned. We are going through all sorts of pains in this country to make sure that the mechanisms we have in place for the primary and manufacturing industries in this country are GATT friendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The market support scheme which has existed is basically a domestic market support scheme paid for by dairy farmers&mdash;not taxpayers, not the government, but by the industry&mdash;through a levy on all milk. It provides extra payment on exports which encourages manufacturers to export rather than undercut each other on the domestic market, which was happening in the mid-1980s. With this encouragement, dairy exports are growing and are now worth more than $1 billion a year. It is a substantial primary industry and is a substantial earner for the Commonwealth of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under 1992 legislation, the market support scheme was to be phased out by the year 2000. At that time, it was to be the equivalent of a five per cent tariff. The government and the coalition have agreed that the phase-out period should continue as planned but in GATT legal form. The bill terminates market support payments to the Australian dairy industry to comply with Australia's GATT requirements. Legislation for the new scheme will be introduced at a later date. The current legislation will be terminated on 30 June 1995. However, this legislation also provides for the termination to be delayed if the World Trade Organisation does not come into force until 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are here, in October 1994, and we are looking at this coming into place in 1995. There is that element of uncertainty. This industry is facing not only this uncertainty but also one of the worst droughts on living record. The government and the coalition agree that the all milk levy should be phased down by the year 2000 to an amount equivalent to a five per cent tariff. Legislation was in place to achieve this. The levy simply collects money on all milk produced and pays it out to exporters to lift the returns from exports. The system keeps the domestic prices up. If exporters were not helped, they would simply sell their products on the domestic market instead of exporting them. This would cause the domestic price to fall because there would be an abundance of milk on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would recall, either earlier this year or at the end of last year there was an amending piece of legislation to the existing act. It plugged a couple of holes with processing operations in Australia, where manufacturers had increased their productivity and their export markets and were bringing milk in from overseas to process and then re-export. The coalition supported the government plugging the gap where some manufacturers were getting export market support for milk that was produced overseas. Over time, the industry has quite maturely addressed that issue. The industry is going along with the measures that the government is taking. It is placing a great deal of trust in the government, and we hope that that trust is returned to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the GATT Uruguay Round? Today we are cognately debating a number of bills, as we did yesterday. These bills are a result of Australia's commitment after the finalisation of the GATT round negotiations, which has now moved on to the World Trade Organisation. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a treaty between 118 governments. It seeks to provide a secure and predictable international trading environment for the business community and a continuing process of trade liberalisation in which investment, job creation and trade can thrive. The GATT operates in three ways: as a set of rules for international trade; as a forum for trade organisations to make trade more liberal and predictable; and as a forum for GATT members to resolve their trade concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we focus on some of those elements. I do not think that the day will ever come when everybody in this nation will be completely satisfied and not a touch cynical about what some trading nations participating in the GATT negotiations are likely to do. We talk about 118 governments participating in the negotiations. Are we going to see 118 signatories? Are we going to see everybody becoming whiter than white as far as their trading practices are concerned? It remains to be seen. We should urge this government to move cautiously and slowly. Unless we see those sorts of reciprocal arrangements existing in other countries, in some aspects Australia may get burnt in its rush to be part of this world trading community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard many speakers in this debate issue that caution as well. We should consider whether this rush with the reductions in tariffs is being balanced by the commensurate amount of benefits on the other side. Are we seeing the reforms within our own country that are going to offset the protection and the support that Australia has given to a lot of our industries, or are we barrelling down this road at 100 miles an hour just to pacify the advocates of a certain train of economic thought&mdash;the free marketeers? Some discussion papers put out on the GATT round mention what world free trade is all about and what is going to be implemented as we go through the GATT process with the World Trade Organisation. We are being told that countries are to reduce by such and such a date their tariff barriers or their equivalents&mdash;whether they be subsidies or tariffs&mdash;by a certain percentage. Joe Average on the street immediately asks the question: are we all starting off at the same base? The answer is no, we are not starting off at the same base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has probably led the way in reducing tariffs. This has been done under the current government, although I know that the coalition offered a similar sort of prospect at the last election. But at the last election we spoke a lot more of the balancing benefits that were going to be provided to industry in Australia to offset the reduction in those tariffs. I go back to the question: will people in the world trading community be reducing their tariffs in&mdash;for want of a better term&mdash;the same real terms? I do not believe they are. I do not have the percentages here but let us say that, over the next couple of years, tariffs have to be reduced by 20 per cent. If Australia is starting off at a 15 per cent base and America is starting off at a 40 per cent base, we are not going to end up on a level playing field and we are not going to end up trading on level terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the question of caution as far as the government is concerned. I suppose that only history will record whether this has been a sound move for Australian industries, Australian primary industries and the employment security of the people working in those industries. It is all well and good to look in those terms at what is going to happen in the future and say `Let's all be a part of that agreement and let's all head towards the trading Utopia'&mdash;which is what it is supposed to produce in the world in the future&mdash;but history will record whether we achieve that and whether Australia's leading the way with the reduction in tariffs and subsidies in industry support has been a wise move or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to where I started: the dairy industry in Australia. Back in the mid-1980s, the dairy industry faced a crisis because there was a lot of internal friction between the New South Wales and the Victorian industries. I note that the shadow minister for resources and energy, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who is sitting at the table, represents one of the largest dairy electorates in Victoria. The Victorian industry gave the New South Wales dairy industry a fair bit of stick at the time and there was need for a great deal of commonsense to be injected into the industry. We should commend the government and all the people involved at the time&mdash;we give credit where credit is due&mdash;who worked their way through a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we have today? We have an industry that is exporting in excess of $1 billion worth of product. It is a stable industry, an agricultural industry that is growing&mdash;not declining.

The idea that the market is infinite is quite silly. The reality is that it is finite. As everyone knows, GATT, free trade and the World Trade Organisation are about winners and losers. They are about how much of the pie the big fellows can take. They are about a redistribution of wealth which favours developed countries and leaves environmental degradation in the exploited developing world. They are also very much about exploitation of cheap labour. Globalisation is definitely not about an equitable distribution of wealth. </PARA>

He then proceeded to tell us ad nauseam that there was no such thing as a level playing field. A couple of minor amendments aside, the Leader of the National Party turned out to be yet another unreconstructed devotee of free trade. In a speech on 23 March this year, I cited a claim by Colin Teese, a former deputy secretary to the Department of Trade, that the US trade deficit would only come into balance if 2.5 million offshore workers lost their jobs. </PARA>

The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) might like to think about his statements recently about the Gulf War as well in that context. According to the ALP, free trade and reductions in tariffs have not resulted in jobs being lost in Australia. In fact, so the fable runs, participation rates are going through the ceiling in this reconstructed Australia. The fact that anyone in casual or part-time work or someone doing one-hour stints in the office or the child-care centre is classified as participating in work is conveniently overlooked by the defenders of our economic restructuring. </PARA>

When I moved my motion on 19 September calling on the government to ban imports made with child labour, there was in-principle support in this House. It was not surprising, however, that only one coalition member spoke and she, the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), opposed the introduction of legislation designed to outlaw child labour.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I listened to the points put forward on tariffs by the member for Wills (Mr Cleary) with a certain fascination but I ended up really rather confused. He seemed to be selecting arguments to suit a point of view that changed depending on whether he wanted to attack the opposition or whether he wanted to attack the government, and that did not seem to be consistent either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem to me that he has chosen to overlook the damage that has already been done by protection to many industries, particularly to some of the industries in my area, for example, in agriculture. It has been a constant source of frustration to see the sorts of barriers that have been put up over the years, to see the effect that those barriers have had and to see the distortions that has brought to our economy, where we have seen far too many resources pushed into industries that have relied more on protection than on performance and far too few going into those industries that have had to face some very difficult trading times but nonetheless have still managed to compete on the world markets. Those distortions, of course, are not just those that are imposed by other countries. Many distortions have been built up within the Australian economy in those industries that have been highly protected, many of which, of course, are in the electorate of Wills and we often hear the member for Wills talking about them. Those sorts of distortions have in fact led to an increasing cost burden on many industries that have had to compete on the world markets. Obviously, agriculture is a good example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the best ways to illustrate this is that particularly during the 1970s and the 1980s the ACTU used to lead an almost mindless wage push, and protected industries, particularly in manufacturing, were able to give wage increases in return for maintaining, or in many cases increasing, the protection. But for those industries that were trying to compete on the world market there was no such opportunity to pass on the costs. As a result, we saw growing in the economy a distortion which I think worked very much against some of our most important export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the member for Wills that he have a long hard look at that too because right now the trading position of Australia as seen in the monthly balance of payments figures is going further and further into the red. Much of that is because those industries that should be able to export more have been starved of capital, of resources and, in many cases, of the talented people to go into those areas so that when they should have been able to increase the level of exports they have been unable to do so. So on that first point I would have to take some exception to what was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I am rather concerned about is criticism of the idea of reducing protection through the GATT process&mdash;something that Australia has fought very long and hard for over many years&mdash;and that this somehow is not in the interests of other less developed countries. Again, that overlooks the fact that wherever a country is able to trade and is not being pushed against barriers in seeking to trade with other countries it can raise its standard of living. There is no question that, if a country can raise its standard of living, those who are working in the industries in that country will be able to pay higher wages and get rid of some of the less desirable practices, such as the exploitation of child labour, which the member for Wills rightly highlights. But the way to get rid of that is to allow those countries to trade into a better economic situation. Trade barriers cut both ways and, if we do not allow those countries the opportunity to trade, how can we be so critical of them if they are not able to raise their standard of living?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the government's past record in handling the dairy industry, I would like to speak about the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very proud of the way that the dairy industry has performed in my electorate in recent years. It has gone through a very difficult restructuring, as part of what has happened right across Australia. In case honourable members have forgotten, we can see just how much the dairy industry has had to change by considering a simple statistic: in 1969 there were 47,000 dairy farmers in Australia; today there are probably about 15,000. In other words, there has been a huge reduction. There are only about a third of the number that there were in 1969, only 25 years ago. So the industry has gone through a quite painful process of readjustment, but it has done it very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria&mdash;and I refer particularly to my region in the south-west&mdash;we have seen an industry move away from supplying the fresh milk market, with manufacturing concentrated mainly on butter and cheese, to supplying many different products, many of which are of very high value. So there has been a huge investment in processing. When we are talking about changes, if we look at the investment in value adding&mdash;to use another buzz word&mdash;in the food industry, of which the dairy industry is a part, the fact that $50 million has been invested just in the south-west of Victoria in the last three or four years is an indication of the confidence that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, despite the success of that investment and the fact that it has led to a significantly improved range and quality of products, it has also been recognised that that sort of investment is going to have to occur again very shortly in order to handle the sort of demand that has been built up throughout the Asian region. In south-west Victoria dairy industry production is worth about $1 1/2 billion to the Victorian economy, half of which is in exports. So it is a very significant contributor to the economy of Victoria and of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a very important industry. I wanted to emphasise this point so that I could highlight my concerns about the way the government is handling this change to the program. The dairy industry has been changing from a domestic oriented industry to an export oriented one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's most recent dairy plan of two years ago is accepted, given our commitment to GATT, or the World Trade Organisation as it is now, that we would have to make changes. I do not think anyone argues against that point. But the concern is that the government has brought in this change to get rid of the existing arrangements whereby there is a levy of around 45c per kilogram of butterfat on all milk to encourage the manufacturing sector. The government is scrapping this arrangement, but putting nothing in its place. We accept that the government has said, `Yes, we are going to do this,' but where is the colour of its money? We do not see what it is going to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to have been around here long enough to know how this government deals. I recall very clearly events back in 1985 when in Victoria the Cain government was just about to go to an election. Those who can remember that will also remember that the Cain government had run into a lot of trouble with the dairy farmers. In fact, there were mass rallies going on and the senior ministers in the Cain government were looking extremely worried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was that Mr Kerin, then a minister in the federal Labor government, decided that he would throw them a life raft. Mr Kerin had tried to build up a reputation as a man of integrity and decency. He said, `A new dairy scheme is being considered and I think it looks pretty interesting.' He knew in his own heart, and I think most people in Canberra knew, that he had no commitment to that and no intention of ever following it through. But he was prepared to put his name to a press release which he put out just prior to that 1985 state election to say that he was going to give serious consideration to this dairy plan. He did that in order to help his Victorian Labor colleagues in that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he had been prepared to give serious consideration to it, then maybe we would not have the same objections now. But the point is that within a matter of days of that election being held and the Labor Party being returned in Victoria he said, `No, I was never serious about that.' He just whipped the rug out from under the industry and said, `Go back to the drawing board. We are not prepared to go along with what I said last week, because the Victorian government has been re-elected.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on that basis that I raise these very real concerns. This is the same government that did that. Now it is saying to the dairy industry, `Trust us. We are going to remove the marketing scheme that we put in place to take you through to the end of the decade, and instead we will give you something else. We are not quite sure what it is going to be yet but trust us. We are going to let you go on.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have very real concerns about that, and that is why I raise it in this debate today. I believe that we, as a parliament, should be scrutinising properly what the government is doing, and I believe that it should be held accountable for what it is doing. I am very concerned that, whatever the intentions, when the government comes back with its alternative, which it says has to be GATT acceptable&mdash;in other words, some system to allow the dairy industry to continue this successful restructure&mdash;it will not honour the spirit of what it has said in trying to convince the industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that United Dairyfarmers of Victoria has said that it is working towards redefining the industry support plan, a support plan which, of course, involves the transfer of $85 million. We are not talking about a small arrangement; this is quite an important thing, because 60 per cent of Australia's current support package is paid for by the Victorian producers. There is a 45c per kilogram butterfat levy, and this support is worth just over $10,000 for a property running 130 milking cows. So we are talking big bickies, from the point of view of the industry and from the point of view of individual farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the build-up to this discussion, which I think the United Dairyfarmers of Victoria is handling in a very responsible manner, it is setting about having meetings amongst members to discuss some of the options. That is perfectly normal, in order and timely. Why does the government have to actually press ahead with this bit of legislation when it knows that it is not essential to do so before the end of the financial year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Dairyfarmers of Victoria has put forward what it calls a reinstrumentation proposal, which has been drafted by the Australian Dairy Industry Council. This features a product levy, pitched at around 4c a litre on domestic sales and also collected on imports. Given that the dairy farmers are prepared to follow this path, the question has to be raised as to why the government is rushing ahead to scrap the existing situation when it has not got an alternative in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that what the Dairy Industry Council is now discussing amongst members will be put forward by the industry as an alternative, but there is still the question of whether the government would agree to it. While the government may have said, `Don't worry, we will look after you,' I go back to the example of 1985, when this government demonstrated very clearly to the dairy industry that there are times when it cannot be trusted. So I raise this concern&mdash;and I see it as a very genuine concern. I ask why the government is prepared to go down this path when, clearly, there is a lot of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time that is left to me, I would like to point out another occasion on which the dairy industry found itself caught short because of the government. That was when the move was made towards closer economic relationships with New Zealand. The industry had believed that it would have a certain amount of time in which to operate as we moved down the path towards closer economic relationships. When the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, went across to New Zealand to discuss changes to the CER, he showed very little concern about the dairy industry and he accelerated the move towards closer economic relationships, which again put enormous pressure on dairy farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that that cost them a lot of money, because the costs to dairy farmers in New Zealand were then considerably less than the costs to dairy farmers in Australia. That is still the case today. I give that as a second example of where the Labor government has sold out on the dairy industry and certainly left it high and dry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to contrast this with the treatment that the government seems to give some of its mates. Who could look further than what has happened with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and what he has done for his mates in the Seamen's Union, or the Maritime Union as it is now called, and ANL&mdash;the Australian National Line? It is remarkable that the pressure was on with a short nationwide strike at all the ports for just a couple of days, and the minister caved in and said, `Okay, fellas: we will do a deal here. You do not have to pay income tax anymore.' Talk about favouritism, about a privileged position, about doing deals to get oneself out of trouble! The deals seem to be only one-sided&mdash;they are only for the mates of the Labor Party&mdash;and this shows clearly that it is not a government that is going to work for all, nor a government that cares about the future of all industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too often in the past we have seen that the government has clearly had very little interest in supporting people working in farming industries. Today, while agriculture has continued to face the pressures of dealing on an international market, it has also had to work with one hand tied behind its back because of the costs that are imposed by the government. These costs arise both directly, through some of the charges that are being placed on agriculture, and indirectly, through the failure of the government to come to proper micro-economic reform decisions in areas such as the labour market, the taxation system and other areas that have directly disadvantaged our exporters but have not at the same time led to proper efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my basic point. I am very concerned about this legislation. We are seeing dairy farmers being asked to take on trust the changes that are going to have to occur because of our agreement with GATT; yet, at the same time, the government is not prepared to give the details of what those changes are going to be before it gets rid of the existing program or plan that is in place for the restructuring of the dairy industry. I am very concerned about it. I believe that everyone in this chamber should be very concerned about it and that the dairy farmers of Australia should be, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems a little ironic and perhaps timely that I am able to have the opportunity to speak on the eight cognate bills being debated at this particular time. The bills of course implement Australia's obligations to amend legislation so that it conforms to the agreements that Australia has entered into to implement the post-Uruguay trade agreements. Those negotiations have been going on for some seven years and have finally led to 120 countries agreeing to implement reforms and policies in the trade area. These reforms and policies will have a dramatic effect on many countries and, in particular, on Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it is ironic and timely because I have just returned from being a member of a delegation&mdash;of which I was deputy leader&mdash;which for the last 3 1/2 weeks has been in France and Europe, meeting with a wide range of people from Europe in government, civil service and industry, and discussing the very things that we are now discussing in this legislation. The visit to Europe was part of an annual visit by the Australian parliament, and I would like to say at the outset that what I learnt over there convinces me that it is vital that the Australian people are represented constantly in the European forums and that we maintain close contact with what is going on over there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very well served by our representatives there, particularly by our ambassadors and their staff, but it is important that the parliamentary level maintain and increase its involvement as the European institutions develop. We met with the OECD, the Council of Europe, the European Union and the European Parliament. I am proud to say that I am wearing the new European Parliament tie that was issued last Thursday in Brussels and given to members of the delegation to wear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to some of the broader issues because I think they need to be seen in the context of this important legislation. The first thing is that I believe that the continuation of a union between major countries in Europe will be a permanent factor in the world. Whilst the countries that are members of the European Union will experience difficulties from time to time, they will remain a solid cohesive force. It is remarkable to observe how pragmatic the European nations are in that regard and also how other nations are making moves to join and enlarge the European Union. I think in a referendum held last weekend in Denmark the people voted in favour of joining the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From Australia's perspective, the fact is that in Europe there is already a powerful union which will become larger. That union, whilst it has other objectives and other responsibilities, is very much involved in developing and enhancing the economies of its members. I met with, and observed, people of all political beliefs&mdash;from the most extreme left socialists and communists to members of the extreme right&mdash;who had remarkably different views on many issues but who had a common pragmatic view about the need to become efficient and to build economies within their nations and the European Community that would enable them to maximise their opportunities for trade. The aim, of course, is to improve the standard of living of the people in the various countries and to expand the range of influence and the activities of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are students of history, as I am sure most members of parliament are, to observe Germany actively supporting the need to enlarge the European Parliament and the European Union by including more countries reveals a dramatic change from what the world was 50 years ago. I am quite convinced that the formation of the European Union is a good thing, because it will help deal with problems and, hopefully, avoid conflicts and wars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of conflict, whilst it is not entirely relevant to this debate, it was chilling to hear of the number of people who may have lost their lives in the Bosnian conflict. It is now estimated to be more than one million people, a quite frightening figure. Is it not worth while supporting every effort by countries throughout the world to try to bring about partnerships and understanding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I left Australia knowing that we had an unemployment figure of about 10 per cent as well as a current account deficit which is frightening and which, in my view, is almost out of control. I believe it requires federal government intervention and a mini-budget, but that has not been picked up yet by the government. I did notice one of the government's senior ministers, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), saying the other day that he thought certain steps could be taken to accelerate the reduction in the deficit and the debt by using certain projected revenues towards shortening the government's public position regarding the deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Europe the unemployment rates are often higher than ours. In France, for instance, the unemployment rate is 14 per cent, whilst in some other European countries the rate is 30 per cent and in parts of some countries 50 per cent. We also notice that the members of the European Union can become and remain members of the union only if they subscribe to targets to bring about, and maintain, certain economic performance levels. In order to achieve those targets, industry, investment and trade are required to expand. So deficits have to be reduced to certain levels by certain times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I make those remarks. I have heard some members in the House yesterday and today express doubt as to whether the post-Uruguay agreements are going to be picked up by member nations such as the USA, Japan and, of course, our country. What I would like to say to them is that there is certainly going to be difficulty and delay and procrastination, as we are seeing in America at the moment because of the congressional elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that there is no doubt in the world that the post-Uruguay legislation will be adopted by those countries. For Australia to delay and not go through with what it needs to do to put in place the agreements in a legislative form is a nonsense. It is burying its head in the sand. It is almost prehistoric talk. It is not recognising the real world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to go ahead and do the things that are necessary, such as the things that are contained in this legislation, in order to maintain the momentum. For Australia to do otherwise would only encourage those people in the American Congress who have been making political capital for their own selfish purposes in their own electorates without taking account of the national interest and the world interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I prefer to be pragmatic. The rounds of negotiations over the seven years have led to the Uruguay agreements. They will be implemented by countries and Australia should remain in the forefront, in the first ruck, and not fall back and be diverted from its course. Do not forget that the benefits from these negotiations over seven long, arduous years are due to the efforts of the negotiators on behalf of Australia and to the several ministers who represented Australia over that long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will gain a very substantial benefit. For example, in agriculture, hundreds of millions of dollars of extra trade will be available to our farmers because of the agreements that have been made. Previously countries have said, `We won't let Australia export to us its clean food, even though it is the best in the world. When it lands on our wharves we are going to load the price with artificial costs in the form of tariffs so that their product will not be competitive with what is produced in our region.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been going on for 50 years. In that time huge inefficiencies have developed. The deficits of countries have grown because governments have had to spend more than they have earned and they have borrowed to pay for the services that people have expected. There is this artificial environment of paying people to produce goods that cannot be sold and of allowing consumers to spend more to buy their everyday food products, thinking that that is the price they have to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, in an efficient environment where goods can be traded reasonably freely, everyone benefits because the consumer can buy at a better price. They have a wider choice. Those countries and economies that are involved in the post-Uruguay environments can see expansion within their own economies as their successful farmers, manufacturers and value added manufactures gain more share of the market overseas. Such an environment can give Australia enough income to start to pay off its horrendous foreign debt and to start to develop a trade surplus. That will stop the dangerous situation of Australia every month spending more than we are earning and our current account always being in deficit instead of being at least level or, preferably, in surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my perspective as a member of parliament representing a regional part of Australia in the Murray-Darling Basin, my area of Australia is the food bowl of Australia. It occupies one-seventh of the continent of Australia but it produces 40 per cent of Australia's total food production, all of it clean, all of it the best quality you can get, and all of it produced by farmers that are the best in the world. Manufacturers are adding value to the food that we produce and are winning exports, gaining valuable export dollars to help us tackle our current account deficit and trade deficit. In my electorate companies like Uncle Toby's, Uncle Ben's, Murray Goulburn, Haberfields, and wineries like Brown Brothers, Campbells and Gehrigs are now exporting every year in excess of $1,000 million worth of value added food products to competitive overseas markets. They are doing that in the face of huge barriers against them imposed by countries that have had a protective wall around them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is part of the campaign that we have all worked hard for to break down barriers. They have not been completely broken down, as we would all prefer, but there has been a dramatic turnaround. Can honourable members imagine what farmers and manufacturers and small businesses in my electorate and others in Australia will be able to do in this improved environment? We will knock them dead, quite frankly, we will gain more market share for our products and we will improve the economy and standard of living for all Australians. In the process we will get jobs for Australians, particularly our young Australians, which is something we all want desperately. At the same time, this will enable countries which are part of this great process to reform and improve their own economies. By lowering their barriers they will become competitive and more efficient and build up the quality of life for their own people as well. So there is a great benefit for all of us in this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that and being optimistic, I have got my feet on the ground and I know damn well that the real test of Uruguay is going to be how the dispute clauses work in the agreements that I have seen. I am a lawyer and I had a look at some of them in the European Council and the European Parliament that deal with the implementation of these treaties that we have entered into. I can see how some countries and some lobby groups and vested interests in those countries will try to manipulate them and find ways around them. If it gets too hot, watch them lobby all the members in the European Parliament and in the Council of Europe to see if they can get a soft loan&mdash;which is a new way of describing a subsidy, although it is not called a subsidy&mdash;and circumvent the arrangements and agreements that have been fought for and negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So do not for one moment think that we have solved all the problems. We are just entering another stage now. But we have to be equipped. This legislation has to go through to enable us to tackle that next stage. That is why I said at the beginning of my speech that it is vital that members of the Australian parliament regularly be involved in visits to the European parliaments. The perspective which we gain from being there can be maximised and enable us to be watchful and alert and to take action when necessary to ensure that Australia's interests are protected and maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to the local area, I have been disappointed that whilst we have made great progress in these negotiations over seven years the government, frankly, has not put in place the necessary adjustment programs to help those who experience the pain of change to cope. In my electorate and in the Queensland electorate of my friend the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) there are farmers who grow tobacco. The tragedy is that they are now seeking from the Commonwealth government the adjustment assistance that they have been desperately wanting and needing in order to make the change imposed on them by government, but it is all almost too late; in some cases it is too late. Last Wednesday and Thursday in Brussels members of the European Parliament told me that some of their own countries have been damn slow in giving assistance to their farmers who are experiencing pain in exiting the common agricultural markets that have existed there for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the amendment that the coalition is putting to this parliament, because it puts pressure back on the government. For example, this legislation deals with removing the provisions for the dairy industry, which is fine, but where are the government's proposals? It has known about it for years; it has known the agreements were entered into a few months ago. So where is the government's announcement about the adjustment schemes and assistance that are necessary so that the painful transitions for our farmers can be put into effect quickly? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As a person who has had long experience of overseas trade, at least in the beef industry, I would like to know which country has this free trade arrangement. We are told it is a wonderful thing. If it is such a wonderful thing, how come no other countries in the world have anything remotely like it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until very recently, the Japanese would not allow any rice into their country. The chances of getting any great amounts of beef into the United States have been severely restricted. Canada and the United States threw some huge ex gratia tariffs upon the beef industry. We woke up one morning and found out that these had been imposed on a completely ex gratia basis. Our sugar is effectively not allowed into Europe. Our beef exports to Japan, Korea and the United States are restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those restrictions are progressively being lifted, particularly in Japan and Korea, but that was the situation that prevailed two years ago when I reviewed the international scene. Our sugar industry cannot get into Europe and cannot get into Thailand, two of our biggest trade competitors. Beef has restricted entry to almost every one of our trading partners. I am not familiar with the situation with wheat. No-one else appears to me to be free trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the GATT arrangements they will have to reduce their subsidies by about a third, which is a pretty fair generalisation. If we reduce ours to a third, they will vanish completely. It is the policy of both parties that tariffs be reduced to virtually nothing&mdash;except, I might add, in the fairly non-competitive TFC area. I do not want to condemn the retention of the 25 per cent tariff there, but the only area that remains protected is the area that is non-competitive. I do not think that is a very clever way to go about making a country competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), referred to his area as one of the great food bowls of Australia, which it most certainly is. However, we are constantly told by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that he is very proud that Australia is no longer what he describes as a sort of extended sheep run and quarry. His words drip with vituperative venom against the people who work in the mining industry and in agriculture in Australia. For a person who refers to his country as the backside of the world, it is unreasonable not to expect him to use that sort of language and to have that sort of hatred for the areas that are carrying this country on their backs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, we constantly hear of the huge volume of manufactured goods that are exported, and yet the only manufactured items that are exported are some very slightly upgraded agricultural and mining products. That is all that is exported in the field of manufacture, apart from the products which benefit from the round robin subsidy which exists in the motor car industry. I am not knocking Senator Button for his arrangements in that industry. They were very good. I applaud him for his $1,000 million dollar gift to BHP to restructure the steel industry. A lot of people think that was a bad thing. I think it was a good thing. It has been effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want our country to go ahead, we should concentrate on the only areas in which it is competitive: agriculture and mining. Only seven per cent of our exports are manufactured items. If anyone doubts that, I have a list from the ABS which itemises the exports. Aluminium is one of the items listed. That may be construed to be a manufactured item, but all I know is that if we are not mining it in Australia we most certainly will not be processing it in Australia. So some downstream processing of our minerals and agricultural products does occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who do not know very much make some very stupid statements. They say that we should be processing our wool. They may go ahead, but all that will happen will be that the people who currently buy our wool will switch their mills to producing something else, because they will not compete against us as a manufacturer. The beauty of Australia is that we do not compete against them as a manufacturer. That is one of the reasons why it has paid for them to stay in wool, even though their countries do not produce wool but produce only woollen garments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsidies are listed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">IPA Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. I think that is a fairly reliable document. I am not telling honourable members anything that they do not already know. Agricultural subsidies are as follows: Switzerland, 80 per cent; Norway, close to 80 per cent; Finland, over 70 per cent; Sweden, 60 per cent. The European Community as a whole has average agricultural tariffs of 50 per cent. The OECD countries have average tariff levels of about 45 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our tariff levels in Australia, with the exception of the car industry and the TFC industry, will very shortly be five per cent. Almost all our industries are already at that level. Whilst we are operating at that level, the people who have given us GATT say that this is a wonderful thing for us because, for example, in sugar we will not have to compete against a 180 per cent subsidy anymore. All we will have to compete against now will be a 120 per cent subsidy. Excuse us for not breaking out the champagne bottles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand has almost a 100 per cent subsidy for sugar. So now we will have to compete against only a 70 per cent subsidy. To compete against a 10 per cent subsidy in world trade is an enormous achievement. I am immensely proud of the fact that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and I represent the biggest sugar producing electorates. Very few human beings work in that industry. Huge behemoths process the sugar. One night I walked almost a kilometre through a sugarcane mill and saw no human beings. The mill was completely automated. Similarly, on the wharves these days there are very few human beings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is about as efficient as you will ever see any industry in the world operating because it is highly mechanised and the cost inputs are extremely low. So even though we have to go out there and compete against a 120 per cent subsidy thanks to the stupidity and the deplorable bargaining powers of this government&mdash;we are asked to do that&mdash;amazingly we seem to be able to at least tread water. Maybe we cannot move ahead, but at least we can tread water. </PARA>

But people do not seem to understand the beef industry because, even though we have had expanding markets, our cattle numbers have not expanded. Quite frankly, as a generalisation, it is pretty hard to make a quid out of the beef industry and in the marginal areas there are simply no cattle at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a station north of Richmond and four of the neighbouring properties were owned by Americans who decided they would not have any cattle there at all. One of them said, `I am going to leave it there for my grandchildren.' But, in any event, if he had tried to make money out of running cattle there he probably could not have done so because it is a very marginal operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we had 32 million head of cattle back in the late 1970s. We now have about 22 or 23 million cattle. Our numbers are down 50 per cent and the reason why they are down is because you cannot make a quid out of growing cattle except in some amenable areas of Australia, and they are very limited areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I turn to wool, there is no advantage there because there are hardly any barriers to our wool production. In any event our wool production has fallen 40 per cent thanks to the people in this place who abolished the minimum price scheme in the wool industry. I do not want to go sideways into that area. So it is not going to help beef and it is not going to help wool. I cannot speak with authority on wheat. To quote Harry Bonnano, the head of the sugarcane growers for Australia, there is going to be some mild improvement and there will be some mild advantages in the area of sugar. There is going to be some very small improvement in that area. As far as I am concerned, the advantages for beef are negligible because we simply will not be able to increase production to meet the expanding overseas markets. We are not doing that now. The same applies to wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what sector is going to profit? It certainly makes no difference to the metals people. They have access to wherever they want now. So which export industry in Australia is this going to help? Why are we sacrificing the Australian citrus industry, the Australian tobacco industry and large sections of our dairying industry? Where is the advantage for Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They said, `We have some reduction.' Yes, I must say that a 30 per cent reduction in the European subsidies is helpful, and with the subsidies in the United States there is a 30 per cent reduction. But when we consider sugar, one of our biggest export earning items, it simply brings sugar down to 120 per cent. So one can hardly break out the champagne bottles in celebration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most experienced people in the field of trade since the Second World War, outside of John McEwen, was Doug Anthony. I had the very great privilege of listening to him recently on the subject of GATT. He said that the advantage to Australia, if he was to quantify it, would be as a pea in a 44-gallon drum. He is a person who should know. Mr Malcolm Fraser spoke the same day addressing this large conference and he made much the same sort of statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in government on the other side of the House have been there for 10 years and have now achieved in the last two months the worst balance of payment figures in our history, bar 1990. So they would hardly be leading authorities on how Australia can move forward. In fact, they would be absolute proof of the monumental diasters that have taken place in the recent period of time. I do not think any intelligent person would be listening to them for advice. It is with deep regret that I say that nobody on our side of the House has any experience, so the sort of people that we should be listening to may be the likes of Fraser and Anthony&mdash;particularly Anthony, who was very active in the field of agriculture in the days of John McEwen when we had an aggressive trading policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think every intelligent person is a free trader. I have never been against free trade&mdash;I have been an anti-tariff man all my life&mdash;but I certainly have never been one to advocate the sort of supine, pathetic and grovelling trade policies that have been the hallmark of this nation for the last decade. We are really talking about whether an aggressive trade policy or a pathetic grovelling trade policy is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am not inclined to agree with John Maitland of the United Mineworkers Federation, there is a lot of logic in the fact that we are selling our coal for the prices we are selling it at because the Japanese and various other buyers play one seller off against another. That is the difference with an aggressive trading policy such as Japan has had. In coal we met a single buyer, as we did with sugar and beef for many years. So these countries have an enormously powerful trading arm, which I think most of the House is aware is called MITI, exactly the same nomenclature that McEwen used in his heyday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I constantly hear McEwen maligned in this place, which rather fascinates me. Unfortunately for his detractors, history books are going to record that when John McEwen left this place we had a current account surplus. It is interesting, is it not, that we say `current account deficit' as one word because never in our period of public activity have we heard of anything but the current account deficit? However, when he left this place there was a current account surplus, unemployment was under two per cent, interest rates were under six per cent and inflation was around four per cent. We were the third wealthiest nation on earth when he left this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures of these great economic geniuses who have run Australia for the last decade have produced over the last two months the worst trading and balance of payment figures in Australian history, with the exception of those of 1990. It would be hard to beat the world records this government set in 1990, but I regret to say that over the next 12 months we will do just that. The real unemployment rate&mdash;and I am simply quoting from the book of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;is around 16 per cent. One of the government's own colleagues has had the courage and integrity to stand up and say honestly that there is a 16 per cent unemployment rate in Australia. We have real interest rates of around 10 or 11 per cent, whilst the United States has six per cent. The last time I looked, Japan had 3.8 per cent and Germany had about four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when I ask myself who is going to benefit from this&mdash;and I think that all of us should be asking who is going to benefit and who is going to lose&mdash;I fail to see what part of the Australian economy is going to gain. It is not possible to expand wheat production. We are an extremely dry country, and we cannot even keep up the wheat production we have had in past years. It is not possible to expand the sugar industry because we need water for irrigation and there are no dams being built in Australia. Because of the policies of this government there will not be any dams built in Australia. So agriculture cannot grow because there is no water. We live in an extremely dry land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government decided to build a Bradfield scheme, a Clarence River diversion, there would be an ability to meet these overseas markets and some benefit for us in the GATT agreements that we have entered into. But that is not the policy of this government. Last month the $2.7 billion that went out of this country in excess of what came in must be a world record. But what is being done to address this problem of the  manufacturing industries collapsing? In the tobacco industry, for example, 6000 jobs will go as a result of what is happening in this place today. Can somebody tell me where we are going to get the income replacement that is going to occur with these exports flowing into Australia since we have lowered the barriers of protection?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we are trying to compete in the field of mining and agriculture. The miners traditionally have to get people to go out to the areas where we mine: in Western Australia and North Queensland, in my own electorate. Those are the great mining areas of Australia, and they have extremely harsh environments. To get people to go out there, we have always given them very sizeable taxation benefits. To get companies to go out there, we have had to give them an enormous amount of fringe benefits. Those fringe benefits are now being taxed, so mining companies are simply not opening up new mines. The old mines have closed, and the cost structures which have been imposed by the centralised government of Canberra have not enabled the companies to expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a situation where Aboriginal land rights legislation in this place and the push by the environmentalists for more and more national parks have made this a shrinking resource. Put that against the fact that we have got to compete in the international marketplace. Let us just look at the members of the European Community, because they are the biggest agricultural producers. They have agricultural tariff protection&mdash;to put it another and more accurate way, subsidy protection&mdash;of 50 per cent. They can reduce that by one-third, and they will still be coming in at subsidy levels in excess of 30 per cent. We have got pretty adequate prices at the present moment, and one would have thought there would have been a great expansion in our cattle numbers, but that is simply not occurring. When we add the subsidy and the cost structures which are imposed upon Australian agriculture, we can see why our cattle numbers are not increasing in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This cognate debate covers quite a substantial area but all associated with the World Trade Organisation amendments. I wish to address most of my comments to items 3 and 4 on the daily program, the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994, which deal in particular with customs legislation in its various forms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so doing, I wish to make a couple of general remarks in association with that which could be called an extension of the tariff debate. The member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has made some very penetrating comments in his remarks. He has my wholehearted support in questioning the productive capacity of Australia over the years, in terms of how we might address the massive debt that this country continues to accumulate overseas through its trade deficit, when our productive capacity is being put under pressure in so many areas. It is most successful in our export production&mdash;and I refer here to both agriculture and mining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agriculture is not only threatened by the seasons. It is being threatened&mdash;in the view of many, including, I believe, the Prime Minister&mdash;as to which areas of Australia might be farmed. I feel that it is going to be substantially further threatened by people in UN committees who will not be using but abusing the desertification treaty which this country is apparently committed to signing. They will be using it as a process of restricting our agricultural production. In other words, having won minor concessions at the GATT, we may find ourselves losing them through the United Nations conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition gives its support to this particular legislation&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that I propose two circulated amendments relating particularly to anti-dumping legislation associated with these measures&mdash;because, of course, notwithstanding our commitment to free trade, we are not prepared to support shonky trade. We see huge damage being done to our industries as we open the gates of our nation to imports from other countries&mdash;countries which might choose, through subsidy or other dumping actions, to destroy our local industry that might otherwise be competitive. I will refer to them after the second reading vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, in assuring the House of the coalition's support in these measures, I must remind honourable members that, over the last decade, many important economic reforms in Australia have been achieved by this government for one simple reason: the fact that this coalition put responsibility ahead of politics and supported the government in areas that were necessary. That is something that we do not see reciprocated when we, as a political party, stand before the Australian people and promote other measures which we believe are of similar benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How easy it would have been, for instance&mdash;had we chosen to just put the pure art of politics as our sole reason for doing anything&mdash;for us to have prevented this government from selling the percentage it has sold of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a national icon. We could have gone out and opposed that move&mdash;something that philosophically we supported&mdash;and guaranteed that the government did not get the money it needed in the bank to assist it with its budgetary problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not on this occasion taken that opportunity, because we believe these measures are in the national interest. Compare that with the last election where, of course, political power was put before government responsibility when the coalition put the concept of Fightback before the Australian people. It was a concept which everybody, whatever their political or economic background, would say was the solution to many of the problems that will face Australian industry under this deregulated tariff regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting fact that there has been significant debate about the citrus juice industry. At the time of the election, while visiting the citrus area, I reminded people that this country allows Brazil, its principal competitor in orange juice, to deliver to the doorstep of the two principal markets&mdash;the cities of Melbourne and Sydney&mdash;its product by the cheapest form of transport available anywhere in the world: international sea travel. I am reminded that grain growers in my electorate will have to pay $40 a tonne to send their product around the Australian coast to provide it to drought affected farmers on the east coast, whereas producers in the United States and Canada can do that for $27. That is how silly the situation is! We proposed to fix that, but of course we were hounded down with scaremongering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, what are we doing to citrus growers this very day? We ask them to compete with their foreign competition while taxing them $2,000 a truckload per week&mdash;through fuel, sales and payroll taxes&mdash;to deliver into the same markets. It is pretty silly, but that is what is happening today. That is the side of this debate that is being ignored and in fact aggravated, as we well know, by the government increasing fuel taxes immediately after the election in which they promised an overall reduction of taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is the result of international agreements under the GATT, and it is the first time in history that agriculture itself has been included in the general international trade agreement, now known as the World Trade Organisation. That is a significant advance. I am the first to recognise that the achievement is constrained in many ways and that as a consequence, as the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) reminded us a minute ago, we have not yet achieved a lot. It has got to be said that it is a gigantic step that, for the first time ever, there are a few rules about agricultural trade&mdash;minimalist as they might be at this point in time. We can only hope for better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say as further comment that there are more difficulties in trade, of course, than simple tariff barriers. There are the non-tariff barriers that affect a lot of our potential exporters, and they include the local marketing and distribution regimes in various foreign countries and buyer loyalty. I visited Japan a couple of years ago in high dudgeon as a beef producer wanting to know why they would prevent me from starting a butcher shop in Japan. And they said, `Well, we won't. You're welcome. You can do it.' That raises a very interesting point. Why then is our beef product in Japan at a retail price 10 times higher than a consumer here in Australia would pay for it? It is clearly not the freight. It is the distribution system. It is the fact that too many people get a 10 per cent or whatever rake-off and the consumer loses. No-one can tell me that buyer loyalty will not be affected by price. I do not care what language people speak; when it comes to the language of money they know what cheap means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wool doonas are something which I have promoted in this parliament time and time again. They are double the Australian retail price if they are sold in Japan. You could carry them over one at a time in your luggage for cheaper than that. It is the system, and it is time this government looked very closely at whether we need some specialist wholesale resale facilities in Japan that might handle product from Australian producers, retail it at the right price and, when the retailer up the road complains about it, say, `Well, how much do you want? We don't want to put you out of business. We just want your consumers to know what the real price of this product should be.' Clearly we have the right to do it, and I think there needs to be some government involvement at least in setting these things up and maybe meeting the original rent or something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got to watch the time, but I just wanted to make a point about what the federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) referred to in this debate when he said that there was absolutely nothing wrong with these sorts of agreements and highlighted how there is no opposition from the coalition on this issue of trade and the responsibility of the Commonwealth. That is for a very simple reason. Nobody has ever disputed since the constitution came into being that trade and defence were proper constitutional powers of the Commonwealth. The difference is that social engineering was not necessarily so. Of course, there are disproportionate influences emanating from various states in their voting power in this place. As a Western Australian I am not enamoured of the fact that New South Wales, with its particular views on certain subjects, gets 50-plus votes while the people of my state get 14 in this place. But, on the issue of trade and the issue of defence, we recognise the role and the right of the Commonwealth to enter, and that is exactly what the founding fathers believed and that was the limit of the power they granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to refer specifically to the issues relating to the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. The customs legislation I have just referred to proposes to amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-Dumping Authority Act 1988 to bring Australia into line with the Uruguay Round anti-dumping agreement and the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement. I repeat that we have two amendments that have been circulated in my name relating to the two bills. They both say the same thing. It is our intention to divide on them because we think it is very important in this anti-dumping area. The amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House urges the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)significantly reduce the inquiry period for anti-dumping and countervailing cases;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress that, particularly considering the size of many Australian producers, time is of the essence. You cannot have subsidised or otherwise dumped product floating around the supermarkets of Australia for any period of time and expect our smaller retailers and producers to survive. They cannot do it. That should be well known by this government, because it is the basic rule of the trade union movement: close a little guy down for a week with a strike and you have got him because he cannot afford to stay out of business. He will give in on the wages issue. The simple fact is that, unless genuine dumping cases are expedited and there are no delays, damage will be done and that damage is irretrievable. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)ensure that the administration of the anti-dumping system and particularly the material injury provisions in the Act, is no more stringent than the comparable policies adopted by the other members of the World Trade Organization.</PARA>
<PARA>That `stringency' refers to the responsibility for those plaintiffs who complain about dumping to prove material injury. It is no good to make our people prove more than other countries around the world demand in their own states. We see dumping as the great danger for the tariff relaxation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we support that policy, we see a danger in dumping. It could cruel many small enterprises within Australia and endanger the jobs associated with them. The government should take our plea very seriously. In fact, considering our actions earlier today, it is the government's turn to join us on this issue. It is a very simple issue. It is right. It should not be the subject of political posturing. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Demonstrate a commitment to protect people under this new regime. It is one of the most important things we need to do. A substantial number of matters relate to this. In particular, I draw to the attention of the House clause 15 of the bill, which proposes to amend section 269TB of the Customs Act to require that an anti-dumping application must be supported by producers who represent more than 50 per cent of the total production or output of that proportion of the industry that indicates its support or opposition to the application, and producers who represent not less than 25 per cent of the total production of goods in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present law, the anti-dumping applications must be supported by producers who represent a major proportion of the total domestic output, but `major proportion' has never been precisely defined. This bill gives a very precise definition. Again, it includes pretty substantial figures. Perhaps one of the problems that industry will have in the short term will be raking up the level of support to get the appropriate applications before the appropriate authority. We warn the government that, if there are any other roadblocks, time extension may be the reason that certain industries collapse. So it is an important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other provisions such as, for instance, the determination of dumping margins. The most important amendments proposed in this bill would alter the methodology for determining whether or not dumping has occurred. Conceptually, dumping takes place when the export price of the goods concerned is less than the normal value of the goods, and material injury to an Australian industry producing like goods has been or is being caused or threatened, or the establishment of an Australian industry producing like goods has been or may be materially hindered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10 of the bill clarifies the procedures for determining the normal value of a good. In some cases, the price of a good in its domestic market is not an appropriate measure for its normal value. For instance, the product might not even be sold on that domestic market. If such a situation exists, the value of the good is determined on the basis of its price in a third country&mdash;that is under this proposed legislation&mdash;or by assigning it a notional value. The bill sets out criteria for selecting an appropriate third country and details the factors that have to be taken into account in constructing a normal value. That is very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existence of dumping is currently determined by comparing the export price of a product with its normal value on a transaction by transaction basis. Clause 11 of the bill adds two new methods for determining the existence of dumping, namely, the comparison of the weighted average normal value of the goods with the weighted average of the prices of comparable export transactions, and the comparison of the normal value of specific goods to the weighted average of their export prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of weighted averages should impart a degree of flexibility that is not currently available and may simplify investigations in some cases. The existence of dumping and the size of the dumping margin would normally be calculated for individual exporters, but the bill would give the relevant minister the option of adopting sampling techniques if the number of exporters was very large. That, again, is positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 12 proposes to amend the system for assessing the material injury to industry due to dumping or to subsidisation. Section 269TAE of the Customs Act lists a number of indicators that can be used to assess the injury. Clause 12 adds the size of the dumping margin, if relevant, or the particulars of the subsidy concerned, to the list. The bill also adds to the section a list of factors, such as contractions in demand, that may be considered as possible alternative causes for injury. Finally, the bill tightens the definition of a threatened injury by limiting it to foreseeable imminent threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as countervailing subsidies are concerned, the existing act does not precisely define a subsidy. Of course, quite clearly, it should. That is a deficiency that has led to litigation in the past. The bill proposes to enact a comprehensive framework for identifying the subsidies that can be countervailed. Proposed section 269TAAC defines a countervailing subsidy as a subsidy that is specific&mdash;that is, limited to the particular enterprise or geographic regions, or is contingent on export performance or the use of domestic goods over foreign goods&mdash;or as a subsidy that is not an excluded subsidy, that is, it is a subsidy provided for research, assistance to disadvantaged regions, or assistance for environmental regulation, or is a domestic agricultural support measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we have to accept the phrase `or is a domestic agricultural support measure' because, as the honourable member for Kennedy pointed out, at this point in time we are not seeing those wiped out by any standard in other parts of the world. I might add that I do not totally share his concern that a 20 per cent or 10 per cent drop is not significant in some of those countries. Quite obviously, the level of subsidy at, say, 180 per cent is given because that is the margin that their governments believe is necessary to protect that industry. That is just inefficient. If the level of subsidy is whittled away, their ability to compete is immediately damaged, and so it should be. That is a matter of some concern to me, but I understand why it is there. In addition, the bill sets out guidelines for calculating the value of a subsidy, an issue that was not addressed in the 1979 code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other miscellaneous amendments which I will not deal with specifically.

The government, in particular, is pleased that the opposition recognises the substantial benefits of the outcome of the Uruguay Round negotiations for all sectors of the Australian economy and we are pleased with the expression of support for this which emerged during the debate. I should take this opportunity to respond briefly to a number of points that were raised during the debate on the legislation and also make some comment on the amendments that have been proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of speakers raised the critical situation facing the citrus industry. I should emphasise, and the House should understand, that the bill before the House addresses only the action necessary for the Australian government to accept the World Trade Organisation agreement&mdash;that is, the elimination of discriminatory treatment of imports vis-a-vis local production. Nevertheless, the government recognises that the citrus industry is facing severe adjustment pressures as a result of very strong competition from Brazilian fruit juicers and the government has been consulting widely with the citrus industry on possible adjustment assistant measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must emphasise, however, that the government has already implemented a number of measures to assist citrus industry adjustment, including a grant to promote sales of fresh orange juice. Government contributions to citrus industry research amounted to $770,000 in 1993-94. There has been a contribution to a fruit fly eradication strategy and continued support for the Australian Horticultural Corporation. With regard to concerns expressed about the manner in which anti-dumping and countervailing legislation is administered, officials are required to carry out the law. The arrangements under the World Trade Organisation agreements involving greater prescription in the conduct of anti-dumping and countervailing investigations should reduce concerns over administrative discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point raised during the debate concerns the thrust of the Eminent Persons Group to report to APEC. In this regard, I can stress that this report is one of a number of inputs into the forthcoming second APEC leaders meeting at Bogor in November. While Australia's objective is to secure a commitment to the long-term goal of free trade in the region, APEC will continue to strengthen the multilateral trade regime and will be fully consistent with GATT and the new World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the amendments foreshadowed by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill and the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. I indicate that the government will not be accepting the amendments. Similar issues regarding the time frame and administration of Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing regime have been raised on previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is not about general policy amendments. The proposed amendments are focused solely on implementing the minimum requirements to conform with the provisions of the World Trade Organisation agreements. The first paragraph of the amendment of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) to the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping)(World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill calls for a significant reduction in the inquiry period for anti-dumping and countervailing cases. In recent years the government has imposed time limits on the administrative conduct of anti-dumping investigations and has significantly reduced these to levels which are considered to be the minimum possible to ensure that a fair and transparent system is maintained. Australia's anti-dumping time frames remain among the shortest in the world. Any further reductions in time limits could adversely impact on Australia's ability to meet the transparency and reporting obligations to the World Trade Organisation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second paragraph of the amendment urges the government to ensure that the administration of the anti-dumping system is no more stringent than the comparable policies adopted by other members of the World Trade Organisation. I point out to the House that Australia's administration of anti-dumping provisions will be consistent with the requirements of the bill under consideration. Those countries signing onto the World Trade Organisation which have, or are introducing, anti-dumping regimes, must, like Australia, conform with the requirements of the World Trade Organisation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each implementing country will interpret the anti-dumping provisions of the World Trade Organisation in the context of its own domestic policy framework. Australia does not have any control over this except to the extent that the government would seek to ensure that the anti-dumping legislation of other countries conforms to the obligations spelled out in the World Trade Organisation agreements. These comments apply equally to the administration of material injury provisions and other aspects of the Australian organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) to the Dairy Produce (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill. This amendment really demonstrates just how out of touch those opposite are with a constituency which they claim as their own. The honourable member for Maranoa ought to know better. While he claims to be gravely concerned about this issue in his amendment, we on the government side are working through the issue with the dairy industry. The re-instrumentation of this supported arrangement is a complex issue and it has involved extensive consultation between the industry and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has given clear undertakings to the industry that the new support arrangements will continue to deliver to the dairy industry equivalent levels of support as close as possible to that provided under the present scheme. That undertaking was reiterated in this House earlier in the second reading speech of the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is already substantial agreement between the dairy industry and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) on a suitable replacement mechanism. Legislation to implement the new support arrangements will come into the parliament early next year. All of this should have been known to the honourable member for Maranoa, and he really should know better. </PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>It gives me great pleasure to present to the House the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill, which establishes a new labelling scheme for goods that make a claim to being Australian. The bill gives Australian consumers a reliable labelling scheme that will help them to identify Australian products and help Australian industry to promote Australian products and to create Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the situation with Australian labelling has caused difficulty and confusion for industry and consumers alike. Consumers, at a time when they are being encouraged to buy Australian goods, are not confident that labels stating or implying Australian origin can be relied on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill takes two terms, `Product/Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' and defines them. These are the only authorised terms that will be used in the future to identify Australian goods. Alternative terms with uncertain meanings, such as `processed in Australia' or `manufactured in Australia' will not be permitted. If a good does not meet the requirements to be labelled with either of these two authorised terms, but some processing took place in Australia, a label can be used which identifies the particular production step which occurred here, but it must also state the source of the ingredients or components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian industry will benefit from having informed consumers making purchasing choices based on reliable information. It will also benefit from having standard origin terms which will enable it to promote the Australianness of its products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members will be aware, this bill was referred by me to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. I agreed to that referral because the opposition expressed concern about some aspects of the bill's implementation, and it has been my policy during the two years that we have been developing this scheme to consult, to talk, to explain and, increasingly, to correct misleading information that has been widely put about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reported on 6 June. It focused almost exclusively on the provision in the bill which defines the two major terms. It accepted that the terms `Product/Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia', with the meanings ascribed to them in the bill, are the most practical and appropriate labels for this purpose. However, the committee was concerned about the implementation of this provision and has recommended that I make a statement to the House on a number of matters. I will deal with all of them later in this speech. The bill has also been considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The majority of that committee recommended that the bill be passed with the amendments proposed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill covers the supply of consumer goods to Australian consumers in Australia. It does not contain a list of goods which must be labelled; rather the rules in the bill apply when a supplier, manufacturer or importer chooses to make some claim about the Australian content of his or her goods or is obliged to do so by some other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important aspect of the bill is that it gives consumers and industry clear terms to identify Australian goods. The terms `Product of Australia' and `Produce of Australia' mean the same thing and are interchangeable. They mean that each major component or ingredient came from Australia and that any processing which took place happened in Australia. This is the label for all-Australian goods. It meets the consumer wish to know when goods are made in Australia from Australian components or ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The label `Made in Australia' means what it says&mdash;that the goods were made here. It recognises that for many products we have to import some or all of the components but that Australian industry and Australian workers transform those components into a new product. The test for this label in the bill is that the goods must have acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. This test reflects the current law on the meaning of `Made in Australia' as established by the Federal Court. It is the meaning understood and accepted by industry generally. By retaining this meaning, the bill reduces the impact and cost on industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the only terms authorised by the bill. The message is then clear and simple for consumers: if the label says `Product/Produce of Australia', it is all-Australian; if it says `Made in Australia', it was made here by Australian workers. It was not merely assembled but made into what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lobby groups concerned about the labelling of food have proposed amendments to the bill to make `Made in Australia' mean all-Australian. It is important to remember that this bill is not just about food; it covers all consumer goods and must be appropriate for them all. This proposal would mean that all those goods which are currently lawfully labelled `Made in Australia' would have to be relabelled to something like `Manufactured in Australia from Australian and imported components'. This would be very costly for industry and consumers. It would penalise Australian industry both in the local market and in the export market and would result in the export of jobs. The government rejects this proposal. If further information is thought necessary for food, then the argument should be put to the National Food Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's other three labelling requirements all remedy situations where consumers are given partial and currently potentially misleading information. For example, a label might identify a particular production step which occurred in Australia, like `Assembled in Australia' or `Finished and packed in Sydney'. In these cases the bill requires that a statement be made about the source of the ingredients or components for the goods. So labels in future will read `Assembled in Australia from imported components' or `Finished and packed in Sydney from imported and Australian materials'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a supplier says that goods were `Designed in Australia', then the place of origin of the goods must also be identified by saying they were also `Made in Australia', by identifying particular production steps which happened in Australia or by saying that the goods were made outside Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Transport. Is it not the point of having a judicial inquiry to inquire into all aspects of civil aviation in the recent past to ensure that actions taken or not taken and decisions made or not made are examined so that lives are not lost in the future? Given that, why is Sir Laurence Street not examining the actions of the chief decision maker, the main person responsible, the Minister for Transport? Is it not a fact that, unless there is a full inquiry with broader terms of reference, the real problems could remain covered up and more Australians could lose their lives? Is it a fact that you, Minister, have said we have nothing to fear, but Australians who fly have many genuine fears?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to an article by Lenore Taylor which appears in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which refers to resolutions which are apparently up for debate at the 50th birthday federal conference of the Liberal Party to be held in Albury in two weeks. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, is coming under strong pressure to promise that a Coalition government would never exercise powers available to the Federal Government through the constitutional external affairs powers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three states have strongly-worded motions on the agenda at Albury urging action to limit the external affairs power, in the case of Western Australia and South Australia through a referendum to remove the power from the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether the newspaper report is accurate about the actual resolutions but, if those resolutions are accurate and if such matters were put in place, they would have far-reaching implications on a whole range of very essential legislation which is currently in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament should understand that one of the reasons for federation was that the Australian colonies as one nation would speak internationally with one voice and that one government should be responsible for external affairs and Australia's international obligations. That is obviously why that power was given to the Commonwealth.

Six people were killed on 19 June 1992. The findings of Mr Gould's report, handed down yesterday, fully support the findings already released to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The coroner found that, on the balance of probabilities, the plane crashed because a passenger moved baggage or a passenger moved during flight immediately before the final descent in an aircraft carrying excessive luggage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult to envisage how the authorities can prevent such a deliberate breach of safety regulations other than by more ramp checks.</PARA>
<PARA>The Civil Aviation Authority has already instituted a program of increased surveillance of the industry; indeed, the most rigorous and detailed checking that the industry has ever experienced is currently under way. To bear that out, it is perhaps appropriate that I advise the House of the first of the reports I have received from Mr Pike, the new head of Air Safety. He is the gentleman whom I appointed to take Mr Macionis's place. He reported to me on 18 October in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To implement arrangements for increased surveillance of low capacity regular public transport and charter operators&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the following actions have been taken: some 130 specialists in the flying operations and airworthiness areas have been assigned to the project. In addition, a dedicated team of four specialists has been selected for each of the three regions of the CAA. Their role would be to travel to locations outside their home regions to check the consistency of surveillance standards being applied across Australia. Each team will consist of two airworthiness and two flight operations inspectors. Appropriate  administrative support staff are being provided to the surveillance teams. Some of the areas in which the teams will focus are ramp checks, maintenance arrangements, operating manuals and other documents. The project is expected to run for two months and will subject these sectors of the aviation industry to the most rigorous and detailed checking they have ever experienced.</PARA>

If there is any inadequacy in this approach, it is for the parliamentary committee, on which the honourable member serves, to pay some attention and to report to this parliament.

Amongst those harmful practices are female genital mutilation as well as early childhood marriages and nutritional taboos. The committee encourages better nutrition, breastfeeding, child spacing, safe delivery and better child rearing practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Female genital mutilation and early childhood marriage leave women with lifelong disabilities and lifelong pain. They contribute to a high incidence of maternal mortality in the countries where they are practised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very serious incident occurred at Mascot airport today involving a Boeing 747 with 253 people on board, mercifully with no injuries involved. It just reinforces the importance of the topic we are discussing in federal parliament today and which we have been discussing over the last few days. The topic is on why our aviation safety is in a state of chaos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will try to give everybody in this House a very quick pictorial example of why our aviation safety is in a state of chaos. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of last Saturday, there was an article all about none other than the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). But in this article he is not called the `Minister for Transport'; he is called the `Minister for Chaos'. The reason why our aviation safety is in the state it is in is that we have a minister running and administering it who is known as the Minister for Chaos. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A whole raft of Government MPs are happy to tell anyone who will listen (off the record, of course) they believe the blame for Laurie's plight rests squarely with himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few people, even in Brereton's factional base, the NSW Right, are great admirers of the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Anybody who has been following the aviation industry over the last little while would share those sentiments, as I am sure all members on this side of the House would. The explanation for the chaos within our aviation safety was in yesterday's paper. As I reminded the House yesterday, an article by Geoff Kitney in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> pointed out that the minister had informed journalists in the gallery that he felt he had not been paying sufficient attention to the problems of air safety in Australia, to the problems of the CAA, because he had been too busy with other duties. We have heard the minister here today in the House deny that he ever said that to journalists in the gallery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to be an interesting time for the minister because I was in the gallery yesterday afternoon and spoke with people who believed they had been spoken to by the Minister for Transport and told precisely what was in Geoff Kitney's article which was reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It raises the question of the basic integrity of the Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to look at aviation safety, and at the state of it at the present time, we need to have a look at the history of the Civil Aviation Authority. The Civil Aviation Authority was founded in 1988 and, in short history, has been the subject of a great deal of controversy: chairmen of the board have left prematurely; chief executive officers have come and gone; and it has been involved in a number of scandals such as the TAAATS inquiry, which members of this House will well remember, where Frank Baldwin, who was the then Chief Executive Officer of the CAA, was finally pressured to leave, along with his sidekick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole host of other scandals have been revealed over a period of time. In the process, a number of credible journalists in the gallery have taken an interest in the CAA and reported major deficiencies within the operations of the CAA. They have been continuously reporting on these for the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to remember that the Civil Aviation Authority's headquarters in Canberra is nicknamed by all those who work there and all those who know it as `Fort Fumble'. If the minister who had responsibility for administering this authority whose headquarters was nicknamed `Fort Fumble' had read in the paper almost weekly of the major concerns about its administration and studied the history of it and discovered it was full of controversy, you would have thought that he&mdash;if he was on top of his job&mdash;would have taken a great deal of interest in its goings-on. You would have thought that he would have made it his task to know what was happening and get on top of the job at the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in the Civil Aviation Authority does not date back to 1988: it really started on 11 June last year when a Monarch Airlines plane crashed in Young, which is in my electorate and my home town, about a mile and a half from my farm. On board that aircraft were seven people. I knew nearly all of them. Those people got on board that aircraft because they had faith in the pilot of that aircraft, they had faith in the person who maintained that aircraft and they had faith in the system which was supposed to ensure that all the maintenance and flying operations procedures were being adhered to. Those people got on board that aircraft because they had faith in the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know what? Their faith was not borne out. Because the CAA did not do its job, those people&mdash;Stephen Ward, who was my opponent at the last election; Bill Caldwell, who was born and bred in the district and a person I had known for many years; Jane Gay, Prue Papworth and Alanda Clark, three teenage girls; and the two pilots, Brindley Baker and Wayne Gorham&mdash;were killed. They were killed because the CAA did not do its job. It did not supervise the system that was supposed to give people faith to get on board an aircraft knowing that they could confidently put their lives in the hands of the pilot and the people who maintained that aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person who is responsible for all of that is the Minister for Transport&mdash;the man who will respond in a few minutes. I am afraid to say that the administration by this government of the Civil Aviation Authority has been a sham. It has been a disgrace. As a consequence, people have lost faith in the veracity and credibility of the CAA. The system has failed them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this crash occurred, I started to do some investigations into why it happened. I discovered the most amazing things about Monarch. The aircraft was flying without many of the instruments operating. The owners of the aircraft were not responsible people. They had not paid a bill to the CAA since November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also discovered that Monarch Airlines had been recommended for grounding three times, the most recent of which was six weeks before the crash. Yet, somehow or other, somebody within the CAA system, which is administered by the Minister for Transport, overrode those grounding recommendations and allowed that aircraft to continue to fly. As a consequence, those people died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what it is all about. So I started to ask questions. Why on earth is the Civil Aviation Authority not doing its job? When I started to investigate it I found the most amazing deficiencies in the way it operated. I found that there was a culture which put the commercial interests of airline operators ahead of the safety interests of passengers. This is why airlines like Monarch were allowed to continue to fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, I also discovered that there are other Monarch planes flying. When I finally got to make a speech about this in parliament on 3 May this year, I outlined all the things that I had discovered. I highlighted also that there were some other airlines that operated Monarch planes and I named them. One of them was Seaview Air. I said that these were dangerous airlines that were putting the lives of people at risk every day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next day in the House we had some questions on it. The minister expressed his concern and said he would take this matter up with the CAA himself. And he did. From the day he gave the CAA the information about my claims made in the parliament, he did not ask it to give him a response for five months, not until the weekend of the eighth or the ninth of October, which just happened to be after the Seaview crash, for God's sake. Why did he not do so? I had expressed these well researched, well documented concerns about Seaview Air and this guy said he was going to chase it up and he did not do anything about it for five months, until it was too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last week or two this man has had the gall to try to say that somehow or other I bear responsibility for all of this; that somehow or other it is me who is to blame because I did not respond in the way George Macionis wanted me to in the letter that he wrote to me after I had made my speech in May. Does the minister know why George wrote that letter? He does; he knows it. It is because he wanted to get me to put things in writing so he could sue me and his colleagues and find out the sources of all these leaks from the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says, `The shadow minister should put forward all of the details so that we can check these things out.' All the details were from the CAA. All the documentation I had had come directly from the CAA. He only had to go and ask the CAA. The files were there for him to find out all about Seaview, to find out all about Monarch, to find out all about Yanda, to find out all about Winrye Aviation. It was all there for you to find out, minister, and you never did, not for five months until after that crash had occurred in the early part of October this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, one has to ask oneself: is this minister carrying out his responsibilities in a responsible and effective manner? I would say to the members of this House that that sort of delay, that sort of dereliction of duty, is not an indication of a minister carrying out his responsibilities with effectiveness and with diligence. It is for that reason, minister, that people have been saying in the last week or two that you should go from your job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister made great play yesterday in this House of a private meeting that he and I had had in his office on 21 July this year in Sydney. He talked about that private meeting. Okay; if he wants to play it at that sort of level I can talk about another private meeting we had which he has not referred to. The private meeting we had was after I had made the speech in the House. It was after the question time, I think, after which we had run an MPI in May. We went upstairs and had a sandwich. I said to the minister, `I have all these concerns.' The minister said, `Yes, I am really worried about the CAA because any organisation that leaks as much as the CAA has a real problem.' Just for the record, as he is prepared to play this sort of game, I might say that he also said to me that he wanted to get out of the industrial relations portfolio, which confirms what Simon Crean said on the weekend. So let us have the game being played fair and square. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dereliction of this minister's responsibilities can be seen in the fact that after the Seaview crash I informed  the CAA that there were two Seaview aircraft flying in Western Australia on a 16-day charter, with 10 passengers in one aircraft and 11 in another, that were flying overloaded and with major problems in the aircraft. On the Tuesday I notified the CAA. On the Saturday they were ramp checked. On the Monday George Macionis, and Doug Roser, the Chief Executive Officer of the CAA, said that there was nothing wrong with those aircraft. Yet I knew that those aircraft had major faults. I knew that they had been flying overloaded. I knew that they were running out of engine time and could not get back to their base before their engines needed major maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is it that I know these things, that I have the files on these things and the documentation to prove it and this man has not? I will tell honourable members why. It is because he has not been interested. The only reason we have seen action out of this man over the last few weeks is that it is starting to become an embarrassment for him. A judicial inquiry, a parliamentary inquiry, an AFP investigation&mdash;all of it is shutting the door after the horses have bolted. That is what it is all about. It is about diligence. </PARA>

Down we are in the gutter with a performance that is so typical of those members opposite. For my part, I think this for all time relegates the member for Hume, someone I have always considered to be basically a decent human being, to the ranks of the political B-graders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the correspondence I have tabled in the parliament&mdash;I have been very open in this process&mdash;has proven that I organised an immediate response to that speech made in this parliament on 4 May.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there such a copy? I will tell you why&mdash;because I had initiated the approach.

But he makes very little of the fact that there was a subsequent invitation&mdash;not by the director of air safety but by the Managing Director of the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;offering him the confidential reporting system of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation.

The minister does not like the message so he marches in here to shoot the messenger. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) brought forward very serious allegations. He has been greatly concerned about the scandals in the Civil Aviation Authority for a very long time. What happens? The minister does not answer those concerns.

He fails to come in here for question time to answer questions on the administration&mdash;or maladministration&mdash;of his portfolio. He comes in here only occasionally.

Obviously, he would like the headquarters to be moved to Thredbo where he spends so much of his time. His performance has been pathetic. He has tried to turn the criticism from his own maladministration in the direction of the honourable member for Hume. That is pathetic!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Brereton is totally incompetent and a danger to the travelling public of Australia. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that we should raise the question of his maladministration in this parliament. As a House, we should also express our concern over his self-admitted claim that he paid insufficient attention to the problems of air safety in Australia, leading to a loss of confidence in his ability and loss of life in the air disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A moment ago, he asked us to participate in a bipartisan conspiracy to trample on the deaths of those people who have been killed in air crashes in Australia. We on this side of the House want an open inquiry. We want the government to come clean. Obviously, we want this cleaned up because it cannot go on this way. Every day of the week people step onto aircraft, confident in the administration of the CAA. But, with the crashes that have occurred, that confidence has been misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not worthy of the respect of the Australian people and, indeed, the minister is not worthy of the respect of this House. Let us look briefly at the history of Seaview Air and the disaster which ultimately occurred. As long ago as January 1994, the Civil Aviation Authority wrote to the chief pilot of that airline expressing very serious concerns about the operational safety of its aircraft. The breaches suggested related to overloading, aircraft being flown without backup navigation, and incorrect marketing of the airline. One pilot flew without a flight plan! That was January 1994. An aircraft crashed in October 1994. </PARA>

What did the minister do? The minister referred the matters to the CAA and then allowed them to rest on someone's desk in the CAA for a period of five months. Can you believe it!

As the member for Hume said, an international 747 aircraft crash-landed at Sydney airport today. We will all be waiting with great interest to find the reason for that. I am wondering whether that aircraft was passed when it should not have been, or whether there were problems which should have been picked up by the CAA. The minister, who is responsible for the CAA, should be answering these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A stench pervades the minister's maladministration of his portfolio areas. Everyone knows that he has got too much on his plate; everyone knows that he is incompetent. He will tell that to anyone who will listen. He rings the press and says that he is far too busy to concentrate on these important matters that he should be concentrating on to save Australian lives. He comes in here&mdash;occasionally&mdash;and fails to respond to an MPI, fails properly to respond to questions, ridicules people on our side of the House who express a very great concern over what everyone in Australia agrees is the maladministration of civil aviation matters, and then he creeps out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did he not have time to look into these matters in relation to safety? Was he organising his capitulation to mining unions over the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal? Was he contemplating the cost of some $4 billion to be paid by New South Wales taxpayers for the Sydney Harbour Tunnel? Was he prevaricating over the future of ANL, which is still a disaster? Australian awards for ANL still require employees to work two weeks on and two weeks off; that is, ANL must maintain 2 1/2 crews, while overseas shipping lines only have to have 1 1/2 crews per ship. </PARA>

In that country even a Labor government was able to reform the waterfront. This minister's record in this area, as in so many others, is shabby by comparison.

No. The minister clearly was also not spending time to reform that disaster known as the National Rail Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very pleasing to see the opposition returning to the present and raising an issue of substance after its little excursion into the past on major issues like who said what at meetings four years ago. A number of us on this side have been a bit worried about the opposition. There has been some debate about whether it is chronically hopeless or whether it is going through a bit of a bad patch. At least we have some potential hope that, now that it has raised an issue of substance, maybe those who take the more generous view are right. Unfortunately, though opposition members may be raising an issue of substance, their contributions have no substance. They are halfway there. We are dealing with something important for a change, but they have not managed to make a contribution that has some content.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw this again with the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) today. The major argument is that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) happened to be on holiday when a plane crash occurred. He was skiing. What was he supposed to do? Throw on the flying cap and goggles, leap out into the ministerial Sopwith Camel and lead the search? Was he supposed to go into the Fuhrer bunker and get the big table out with the maps on it and move the little markers around? That is the sort of inane lunacy that comes from the opposition when the search went on for several days, when the minister was in regular, daily contact with what was going on, when there was no knowledge of what had occurred and no basis to make any assumptions about what had happened, what had caused the plane to go missing and where it had gone down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the sorts of points of substance that the opposition has managed to raise in this debate. Until that search and investigation were completed, there was no basis for knowing what had caused the plane to go missing or what had caused the crash. The minister was entirely proper to maintain contact, but the suggestion that, in some way, there is some connection between where he was at the time and the crash itself is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the minister done? In response to the accusations raised about the Monarch disaster, the minister initiated a parliamentary inquiry headed by the member for  Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). He has initiated a federal police investigation into certain matters. He has initiated the separation of the air safety section of the Civil Aviation Authority to a different authority, and he has most recently initiated an inquiry, headed by Sir Laurence Street, former New South Wales chief justice, into the Seaview disaster and all aspects of CAA administration of air safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the opposition would like the terms of reference broadened to include a few things like the Sydney Harbour Tunnel or some of the other red herrings that have been thrown into the debate. Contrast this with the contribution by the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who has managed to throw around all sorts of accusations, such as corruption&mdash;and that is a fairly strong word. But every time he is challenged to put up, he runs away. Every time he is asked to produce some evidence, he runs away. Today we heard him come forward with the most extraordinarily pathetic excuse that we could ever expect to hear; namely, that he was worried about being sued for libel. What is to stop him from raising these accusations in here? He cannot be sued for libel in here. He refuses to provide details of these accusations and says, `I am worried about being sued for libel.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the opportunity to table a document this morning at a meeting of the committee headed by the member for Shortland, of which he is a member. This very day he could have submitted that document to the committee, and he did not do so. There may well be some serious problems in the administration of air safety in this country and that, as a result of some of the things that have happened with the CAA, particularly with lower level employees not passing on safety issues to senior management, there is an issue to be investigated very seriously. But we cannot make presumptions about causal connections between those problems and individual crashes until the investigation is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we also need to look at some of the broader issues here: the question of the ever-increasing intensity to deregulate, of which the opposition is always in the vanguard. We have increasing pressure on organisations like the Civil Aviation Authority to allow greater freedom for businesses to make a profit even if passengers are at risk. The government has also been deregulating in a variety of areas, so it is not just a problem on the other side, but it is something that we ought to pay serious attention to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, if serious, should start giving us its views on some of the substantial issues that are involved here. What do opposition members have to say about air safety regulation? What do they have to say about the regulations? Are they too strict? Are they not stringent enough? Should they be changed? They should address such questions instead of coming in here, throwing buckets over people and looking for everybody to be sacked. They want the head of the CAA and the minister to be sacked. Let us have a contribution of substance on the issues because there are serious issues to be dealt with about the nature of regulation and the extent to which we should ensure that passengers are protected and that businesses are able to continue operating the airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we should be grateful for the opposition returning from the past and dealing with an issue of substance  for a change, we may have to wait some time before we get a contribution of substance on these issues. We had a major debate about a very important part of the airline industry recently within the government&mdash;that is, the future of the Federal Airports Corporation. That substantial debate occurred openly. Safety issues, such as the maintenance of runways and lights, were involved. There were many other issues, but safety was an important factor in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate, what did we hear from members of the opposition? All we heard was: sell, sell, sell. Did we hear anything about the prospective future for safety issues in a privatised airport regime? Did they give any consideration to those issues? No. What we heard was an incredible suggestion by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) that the opposition would cut the FAC in half. We would have a privatised northern FAC and a southern FAC competing against each other. In other words, in their ideal aviation industry, we would have Cairns airport competing against Adelaide airport. I can see the tourists from Asia talking to each other over in Hong Kong and Singapore saying, `Where will we go this year? Will we go to Adelaide or Cairns? I hear the Adelaide airport is very nice at this time of year.' That is an unbelievable proposition. That is an illustration of the depth and substance that we get from the opposition's aviation policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to come in here when there has been a disaster of this nature and call for everyone to be sacked. That is a very simplistic and superficial response. Instead, opposition members should come in here and talk about some serious issues, such as how should the aviation industry be regulated. The opposition is floundering in debates of substance because it is full of superficial people bereft of policy ideas. We need look no further for evidence of this than the last federal election. Opposition members came forward with a substantial policy comprising 500-odd pages. But where did it come from? They had to contract it out. They had to go to Access Economics to draw up a policy for them because they did not have the capacity and the ability on their own benches to draw it up themselves. That is a perfect illustration of how bereft the opposition is of serious policy substance and the ability to come in and debate major issues of national importance like this with anything more than just vituperation and nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the government&mdash;the Labor benches&mdash;is full of people who make substantial contributions to policy debate in this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) will both be remembered as people who have made leading contributions to ideas and policy debate in this country long after they have left politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can the same be said of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer)? Can the same be said of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello)? Have they ever written anything? Have they ever put ideas on paper? Have they ever come forward with major substantial policy initiatives? They put forward less than the average backbencher on our side. What we end up with is nothing more than pure vituperation and bile masquerading as policy substance. All we get are mindless attacks on public servants and chanting: `The minister's got to resign, the minister's got to resign.' They completely ignore the substantive issues that we all accept are of crucial importance in this area. Nobody is disputing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has responded promptly on every occasion and he has been congratulated for doing so by the shadow minister until the shadow minister realised he might get some political capital out of the issue and changed his tune. He has responded correctly to the Seaview tragedy and to indications that there may be deficiencies in the administration of air safety regulations by the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that the opposition would seek to make as much capital as it can out of these circumstances. Let us face it, there is not much else around for it. It is understandable that we are hearing these things. But, please, at least come in here and give us some substance about what you would do with respect to air safety regulation. Let us talk about the real issues, deregulation and these sorts of things, and not throw brickbats just for the sake of it. Let us talk about the substantive issues and get some genuine policy debate into these very serious matters. </PARA>

Before I call the minister may I say that, although I have not had the opportunity to study the Senate amendments carefully, there appears to be some uncertainty about the effect of parts of amendment No. 4 in terms of a possible charge or burden on the people. The point arises as to whether the Senate was able to amend the bill in this way or whether that particular matter should have been dealt with by way of request.

<PARA>The coalition and the Australian Democrats say they do not want to run a dual system, a with child DSR and HCCA; they want to give people the option to fall back onto the DSR only if they do not qualify for any HCCA during the previous year. There is no practical way to design such a system. This is because DSR is based on financial year eligibility and HCCA is based on eligibility in a fortnight. To pay DSR only after HCCA qualification for the year is tested would require that clients attest their HCCA qualifications 26 times a year, that is, each fortnight. This would be nonsensical and surely cannot be supported by the coalition, the Democrats or the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, it would be virtually impossible to determine HCCA qualifications retrospectively, which is what the Democrats' amendment proposes. To preclude any payment of DSR if families qualified for the maximum HCCA payment, even if they did not claim it or receive it, runs the strong risk of these families missing out altogether and losing up to $1,560 a year. This is when the coalition is complaining that the government amendment would result in a maximum loss of around $240 a year. It has to be recognised that there is no DSS payment that has a 100 per cent take-up rate, so the amendment that we are talking about would definitely involve people losing amounts of $1,560 a year, and most of those people would be on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendment is sounder in terms of policy and is workable for clients and administrators. In allowing people to get either the without child DSR or HCCA throughout the year, we ensure that no-one receives anything. At the end of the financial year, people can apply for the without child DSR and, if they receive less HCCA, they could get the difference between the two. There are also a number of technical problems with the way in which the amendments are drafted, which undermine the coalition's intentions. It is for those reasons that I move the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be opposing the government's proposal to disagree with the amendments that have been carried in the Senate. Let me first give some background to this matter. When the government introduced the new social security payment, known as the home child-care allowance, it did so in legislation, in the Social Security Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated at the time that many people did not understand what the government was about at the last election when it proposed this new initiative; it was quite clear that what the government was involved in was a sham. The government was intending to take away from a family household the benefit that was available before, known as the `dependent spouse rebate'&mdash;it used the term `cash it out'&mdash;to pay for this new home child-care allowance. The government was trying to create the impression that it was being extraordinarily generous by creating this new benefit that families were going to achieve. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government brought the home child-care allowance legislation in with great fanfare. It proposed, also with great fanfare, a very expensive advertising campaign to ensure that people were aware of this particular benefit. The government did not introduce at the same time as it introduced legislation for the home child-care allowance legislation to repeal the dependent spouse rebate. It left it until a later period. It is in the form of this bill that is now before the parliament and the amendments associated with it. The home child-care allowance was introduced some time ago. People are applying for it. But the dependent spouse rebate, which had to be repealed to pay for it, was not repealed at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government is in a situation of difficulty, of its own making, because it did not see fit to introduce the legislation to repeal the dependent spouse rebate at the same time as it introduced the legislation for the home child-care allowance. It did not want these arrangements to be clear and transparent for all to see. The government's proposal was advanced on the basis that people were going to benefit significantly from this new home child-care allowance. People who were not previously eligible for the dependent spouse rebate were going to obtain a benefit for the first time, and they were going to obtain an additional benefit; I think it was about $4 a fortnight. In this context, there were significant advantages for people as a result of this new benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government did not tell people was that, because it was going to introduce these new arrangements into the social security legislation and remove people from being able to get the old dependent spouse rebate on a with child rate, which was roughly equivalent to the home child-care allowance benefit, there were numbers of families&mdash;not large numbers&mdash;presently eligible for the dependent spouse rebate on a with  child basis which were going to be no longer eligible for a benefit because the new rules for the home child-care allowance were applied on a different basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the families that were going to miss out were the families that were overseas for longer than 13 weeks, and that could include aid workers, missionaries, academics, exchange students&mdash;a whole range of people with children. Other families that were going to miss out included: families with children who were dependent full-time students aged 18 to 25 whose income is less than $1,785 a year; families disqualified from the home child-care allowance as a result of more onerous social security income definitions; and families with children who were receiving the prescribed student payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we have asked the government to do is to ensure that those classes of people who had a reasonable expectation that they would continue to receive benefits will be able to do so. Without all the resources that are available to the government, without the assistance of parliamentary counsel to advise, we have drafted amendments to give effect to that. We believe they achieve that objective. The government tells us that it does not think they quite achieve that objective, or that it may be difficult for the departmental officials to apply these matters. It had not brought these arguments forward before, but it is bringing them forward now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious that there are administrative difficulties, I encourage it to talk to me and to put those difficulties to me. We are not unreasonable people. There may be another way of drafting amendments to achieve this objective which will not present the government with the embarrassment that it believes it may now face in having to implement these provisions. If that is the case, let us sit down and talk about it. But the government has not sat down at this stage to do so. In that context, there is no way that we could accede to the government's view that our amendments should be defeated. We press our amendments. But, as I said, we are not unreasonable people. If the government has a proposal it wants to talk about, I am happy to sit down with its officials and go through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear that there are classes of people who had an expectation that they would continue to receive benefits. There is no way that we are going to abdicate in relation to those people. There are not many of them. It is not a significant cost to revenue. It is not going to cause the budget to blow out. It will cost a great deal less than a cultural statement. It is not going to interrupt the government's fiscal strategy. There are people with children who ought to be able to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the with child rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing an alternative. It would leave people being able to obtain the dependent spouse rebate on a basis where no children are involved. That is paid at a significantly lower rate than the with child payment. Of course, that is unacceptable to those on this side of the House. That is what the government's amendment to clause 57 would be designed to achieve: it would allow the dependent spouse rebate to remain in place at the lower rate, that is, the without child rate, even though people had children and may be in the circumstances I have described. So the government's amendment certainly does not meet our objective in any way, shape or form, whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, we are not unreasonable people on this side of the House. We are quite happy to sit down with the government to talk these things through if the government thinks these issues are important and need to be addressed in a positive and constructive way. But, at this point in time, no effort has been made to undertake that sort of task. I make it clear that, so far as the opposition is concerned, we are pressing on with our amendments at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not hear many defensive points in the speech of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) for the amendments coming over from the Senate, and quite rightly so. Any amendment that says you get either all or none at all, when we have a fall-back position, seems to me to be an amendment that should not be supported by a sensible government or even a sensible opposition. The amendment says that, if people do not take up the $1,560 a year HCCA, they cannot then fall back on the rebate. That is a ludicrous situation. As I said before, the simple fact is there is no DSS pension that has a 100 per cent take-up rate. So obviously there will be losers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me pick up a few points made by the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Berowra. Those opposite go on all the time about how this is a big con job on the people of Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This allowance&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about HCCA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's policy speech was watched by millions of people around Australia, yet somehow this is supposed to be a big conjuring trick we have played on the Australian people. The only thing I can deduce from that is that the opposition was not good enough during the election campaign to say, `Here is a tricky thing; they are going to promise you this new allowance but what they are really on about is taking away your rebate.' But you never did it, so maybe you were just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the last time we were here the opposition spokesman moved an amendment that he thought gave, as a fall-back position, the DSR with-child rate.

For all the reasons I outlined before, the government has moved an amendment which works in practice, is fair and looks after the people of Australia, and we will be pressing ahead with that amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amendments Nos 31 to 33 be disagreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>In terms of the amendment before the House, there is nothing in the structure of sales tax in Australia which requires a credit on the grounds being sought; it is simply an extension of a concession that has already been given. It is the ultimate concession that is given to government and benevolent bodies in that they do not pay sales tax at all on the goods they use. Even allowing for the arguments put up by the opposition, the economic impact of providing the credit would appear to be marginal at best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remanufacturing of goods, such as photocopiers, is a labour intensive process; in fact, 85 per cent of the value added tax is labour and 15 per cent is sales tax on parts. So we are looking at about 15 per cent off 20 per cent&mdash;around three per cent. If the concern is that tax exempt bodies should have that sales tax remitted, we would have to look at the practicalities of doing so. When we are looking at making the tax system simpler&mdash;that is, reducing complexity&mdash;we would have to ask ourselves whether it is really worth adding this layer of complexity on top of the tax system, for what is at best a very marginal return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is a problem in making the sales to the tax exempt sector, it is worth only a few dollars because in some industries remanufactured goods are already about 20 per cent cheaper than new goods yet carry the same warranty. If government departments do not buy those goods already it has to do with something other than sales tax, because the sales tax component of what we are talking about is very minimal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to give this concession, there could be no guarantee that the benefits would end up with the tax exempt bodies. If a Xerox photocopier were sold to a public library somewhere, what is to say that the exemption when it was sought would have been built into the price in the first place? We have no way of knowing for sure if that benefit will be passed on to the recipients intended in the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds of good ideas for not charging sales tax on certain goods, and they all come at a price. It staggers me in some ways that, for an opposition that talks about government spending and cutting government spending, we are yet again facing an amendment which would require the government not only to look at the complexity of the tax system that is adding layers of complexity on top of the tax system but also to spend money. We are looking at ways to cut government spending&mdash;that is, should the opposition become the government&mdash;and this runs in the face of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even though the whip said he needs a whipping. Maybe that is true. When we talked about giving credits on sales tax in the areas that mattered, we gave it where it mattered: to goods producers and exporters. I am talking about the amendments we put through this House last year in relation to repaired goods, such as tractors which went to people like farmers, and remanufactured goods which went to the miners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the many representations I received from opposition members, I know they thought it was unfair that if an agent used spare parts on a second-hand tractor which was sitting in his yard he would have to pay sales tax on those parts but when it was sold to a farmer he had no way of getting a rebate on the sales tax paid on the spare parts used to repair the second-hand tractor. We have fixed that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I noticed at the time&mdash;if we are talking about the principle that underlies the amendment that is being moved at this time&mdash;was that this situation was not raised then. If this principle that tax exempt bodies should be given a credit for the sales tax on spare parts which go into remanufactured or repaired machinery is such a hot issue at this time, why was it not such a hot issue at that time? Or is this some newfound principle that the opposition has come up with? For all of those reasons, I have moved the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments affect sales tax on what are known as remanufactured goods in Australia which are sold after remanufacture or reconstitution to exempt users. The coalition's amendment in the Senate sets out to provide sales tax exemption for parts used in the remanufacture of goods sold or leased to exempt users such as government departments, schools, libraries and so on. There can be little objection in the ultimate goal in that the bodies likely to be beneficiaries are essentially non-profit organisations of one kind or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are of the opinion that the amendment is desirable for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the existing treatment of remanufactured goods was not apparently intended by the new sales tax legislation and is inconsistent with the sales tax treatment of both new and imported remanufactured goods. Secondly, the current treatment is a disincentive to what is a burgeoning local remanufacturing industry. More than that, it is business of a kind which can be categorised as small. We pay lip-service to the role of small business in this place but when we have an opportunity, for little or no cost, to give some sort of sensible encouragement to those in a particular sector we fail to do so. The government is guilty on this occasion in opposing these Senate amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remanufacturing has a beneficial part to play in the Australian economy and particularly for that part which is serviced by what we have come to call small businesses. Even the Greens and the Australian Democrats in the Senate supported this measure. I call on the government to give its support to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will encourage the remanufacturing industry, which has great potential for significant future growth. There is growth in overseas demand for remanufactured goods. Australia's remanufactured goods are also substitutes for new and remanufactured imported goods. In a small but nevertheless understandable way we are talking about import substitution opportunities. Obviously, there are also significant employment and recycling advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, and especially the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, made it clear some time ago that it would have discussions with industry about this very issue. That was encouraging to the coalition. I, and I am sure some of my colleagues, find the government's response to this amendment disappointing in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill, the government is extending the availability of sales tax exemptions to parts used to repair goods to be exported. The coalition amendment goes one step further and  follows the logic in the same direction. It is as simple as that. We seek to restore the status quo of the sales tax position as at 1 January 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good for the government to say that for decades the law was unclear, because the law operated very clearly in relation to this issue. The restoration of the sales tax exemption, while generating significant benefits for the economy and encouraging the use of recycled products, will have a very minor impact on revenue. The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said that the government is worried about the benefits being passed on. I know the Assistant Treasurer in his own mind and heart understands that, with a burgeoning remanufacturing industry, competition will take care of a business that does not structure the price it sells&mdash;in this case, remanufactured goods&mdash;for and it will simply lose its share of the market and will not survive because it will not be price competitive. I recommend that the House accept the Senate's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the point raised by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), I say that, if we compare remanufactured sales, overwhelmingly we find that two-thirds of the market is sold to bodies that produce goods, and therefore will be tax exempt, and where a credit will be given. Given that that is the case, local remanufacturers are advantaged in that market. In the majority of the market, local manufacturers have a natural advantage over the importers because the sales tax on imports is on the labour plus the parts. As I said before, the sales tax on parts in Australia is minimal indeed. For all of those reasons I move that the government's amendment be accepted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude this outline of the scheme without referring to the Australian made logo. The green and gold kangaroo in a triangle has been a successful marketing and promotional tool for government, industry and the Advance Australia Foundation, which administers the logo on behalf of the Commonwealth. It has achieved this because it has been a valuable aid to consumers who want to buy Australian goods. The bill provides that the term `Australian made' may be  used in conjunction with the logo and requires that the logo must be accompanied by one or other of the authorised terms, that is, product of or produce of Australia or made in Australia. The bill thus ensures that the logo will only be used on goods which really are Australian and that it will continue to be an authentication of the claims made on the goods. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>The amendments made to the Trade Practices Act by this bill will make sure that consumers get reliable information about the Australian origin of products. Informed consumers are an important prerequisite for market efficiency. Although there may be some initial cost to industry&mdash;in many cases industry has already changed to comply with the new scheme&mdash;in the long term it will benefit from having a reliable scheme that consumers understand and have confidence in. Any relabelling costs will be minimised by the lengthy phase-in period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already budgeted for an education campaign for consumers and industry. The campaign will help industry decide on the appropriate labelling for its products. The government intends to do this through a series of guidelines developed by the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs in consultation with the Trade Practices Commission, industry and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the matters raised by the committee in its report. The committee has recommended that I make a statement in Parliament on the procedures for formulating guidelines to assist industry to comply with the legislation, and that I give an explanation on the consultation mechanism. Some members of the committee have suggested that the guidelines be written before the legislation is passed. Let me set out what happens at the moment and how I envisage any guidelines being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, officers of the federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Trade Practices Commission give individual oral and written guidelines every day of the week to Australian businesses on how to comply with various provisions of the Trade Practices Act. That is their job. They administer and enforce the law and part of that job is to help industry understand and comply with the law. In addition to this individual advice, the commission issues press releases about particular problems. In December 1990 it issued one on orange juice. It says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The description `Made in Australia' . . . should only be applied when those operations that gave the product its essential nature took place in Australia . . . In the case of fruit juice, the country of origin was the country where the `fruity' nature originated. The addition of water would not be considered by consumers to be the `essential' quality of the product.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a guideline for industry. In other words, juice made from imported concentrate cannot be labelled `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission also issued a more general guideline in 1990 on labelling the origin of goods. It outlines the law; it gives details of relevant court cases; it gives advice on the sorts of matters a business should take into account when considering whether to label its goods `Made in Australia'; it says that, in borderline cases, if in doubt err on the side of caution by describing the processes that happened in Australia rather than claiming that the product was made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines that are proposed for this legislation would be modelled on the commission's 1990 guideline. They would cover the same material, the law and court cases, plus information about the other provisions of the bill, based on the explanatory memorandum. However, it is envisaged that, instead of giving general advice, the particular conditions of particular industries could be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, guidelines for the paper industry are likely to say quite categorically that paper which is imported in rolls and cut to size and packed in Australia cannot be labelled `Made in Australia'. This situation is a clear analogy with the case involving rolls of sticky tape which were only cut to size in Australia and could not be labelled `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Guidelines for the chemical industry would point out that where the active ingredient&mdash;for example the screening agent in sunscreen&mdash;is imported the product probably cannot be labelled `Made in Australia'. The essential characteristic which is being promoted has not been acquired in Australia. Advice for the footwear industry is likely to discuss the problem of whether shoes made from uppers which are already shaped when imported can be labelled `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all cases, the bureau and the Trade Practices Commission would consult with industry bodies and individual manufacturers about their manufacturing processes, the nature and source of components, the particular conditions that apply and any problems that arise so that relevant and useful advice could be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of advantages in bringing all the disparate bits of advice together in uniform guidelines in this way. It ensures that the advice is consistent. It is not always easy to ensure that an officer in Perth and another in Brisbane are giving consistent advice to businesses asking the same questions. More importantly, it protects industry. It is a defence to a prosecution under the Trade Practices Act that the defendant reasonably relied on information supplied. The fact that any guidelines could be used as a defence should not be taken to mean that the guidelines will in any way affect the law as it will be applied by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines as currently proposed will have no legislative force. They will have no effect on the interpretation of the legislation in particular cases. No legal obligations or responsibilities can be imposed on industry through the guidelines. If the guidelines attempted to do such a thing they would be of no effect. The law as set out in the act will always prevail over anything that is said in guidelines. The only legal role the guidelines will have is as a defence for industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that we have a number of options. We could attempt the unprecedented exercise of drawing up guidelines before the legislation is passed. This would mean going to industry and asking it to invest time and resources in drawing up guidelines to explain some legislation which is not yet passed and which may be amended, or not passed at all. It seems to me that if we went to industry with this proposition it would be properly outraged about the waste of time and resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of food, it would be an even bigger waste of time and effort to make guidelines now. The National Food Authority has been considering for some time amendments to the origin labelling standards in the Australian food standards code. Guidelines for the food industry should wait until the standards in the code are finalised. The sooner this legislation is passed, the sooner that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another option would be to stop giving advice to industry. We could issue no guidelines and I could direct the Trade Practices Commission and the federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs not to answer queries. We can say to industry, `You work it out and if you get it wrong we will see you in court.' That would be an abrogation of our responsibility. Or we can do what is normally done when new legislation is passed, and what industry wants us to do and what we are proposing to do. We can draw up guidelines in consultation with industry which will help industry understand and comply with the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also asked for an explanation of the interpretation and meaning of `essential character or qualities'. As honourable members will recall, this phrase is used in the definition applying to `Made in Australia'. From what I have already said about orange juice, shoes, sunscreen and paper, it should be clear that the meaning given to this phrase will depend very much on the particular circumstances of the case. In this, it is no different from other provisions in the Trade Practices Act. For example, who would care to give a definition of `misleading and deceptive conduct' which would cover every possible case likely to arise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill itself gives some examples drawn from existing case law of when goods acquire their essential character or qualities. These examples generalise to a certain extent the specific circumstances considered in the cases. Any further generalisation would hinder the court's consideration of the particular circumstances of each case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the guidelines is to give guidance, based on the cases, on the factors to be considered in the particular circumstances of each industry. I add here that, in two years of consultation, industry has consistently asked that the `essential character' test remain. Industry is familiar with this test and has been applying it for at least the past eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also asked for a definition of `major component or ingredient'. For a product to be labelled `Product of Australia', each major component or ingredient has to come from Australia. The bill contains no definition of `major' because one definition would not be appropriate for the range of goods covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may have noticed that none of my examples to date has been about food. This was done to emphasise that the bill covers more than food. But `Product of Australia' is likely to be used most often in relation to food. Australia produces a wide range of all-Australian food&mdash;cheese, fruit juices, tinned fruit and vegetables, nuts, cereals, bread, sugar, pasta, wine and a host of other items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Food labelling is the responsibility of the National Food Authority and the Commonwealth, state and territory health ministers meeting as the National Food Standards Council. As I mentioned, the authority is now considering amendments to the origin labelling standards for food, which include a definition of `major ingredient'. Essentially, it was defined by weight. For other products, consultation with industry will give some indication of what products are likely to qualify for the `Product of Australia' label. Timber products, clothing and some plastics spring to mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which concerned the committee was the position of suppliers who source a major ingredient from Australia for part of the year and import it for the rest of the year. The committee seems to have accepted what I said in evidence on this question, but I am very happy to say it again. Where a product is subject to predictable seasonal variations in the source of supply of components, it is up to the manufacturer to decide whether to use one labelling run to cover all situations or to change labels as the source of supply changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is sufficient market advantage in identifying the goods which are all Australian as all-Australian, then companies will do this. If there is a perception that the return will not cover the cost, then companies can use labelling which covers all situations. An example which I showed the committee was fruit juice labelled something like `Blended from a mix of high quality Australian juices and imported juices according to seasonal variation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the government nor Australian consumers will accept producers labelling their goods all year as being all-Australian when for part of the year they contain imported ingredients or components. There are acceptable solutions to that problem which are currently being used by suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee points out, the defence in section 85 of the Trade Practices Act, which relates to causes beyond the defendant's control, will not normally apply to these predictable variations in supply. As I mentioned in evidence, it might, however, apply to such unpredictable events as crop failures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent months there has been concern in some quarters, particularly Tasmania, about identifying the regional origin of goods. This arises because the bill prohibits the use of such terms as `Product of Tasmania' or `Made in Hobart'. However, as the committee notes, the bill provides companies with plenty of other opportunities to promote their goods on a regional basis while still meeting the requirements of the bill. One way of doing this is to add the name of the place to one of the authorised terms: for example, `Product of Australia&mdash;Tasmania' or `Made in Australia at Hobart'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is planning to move an amendment to section 65VE(2) of the bill to make it quite clear that the legislation does permit identification of a particular place in this way as part of an express and unambiguous representation that the goods are Australian. This amendment says that a representation in the table may be followed by words that identify a particular place in Australia or a particular part of Australia. The words `followed by' have caused some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have suggested that this means that all references to place have to follow the authorised term. This is a misunderstanding of the amendment. The amendment is in the section dealing with express and unambiguous claims. It applies only to the positioning of place names when they are used as part of an express and unambiguous claim made under proposed new section 65VE. It does not apply to the positioning of such statements as `Tasmanian cheese', `traditional Tasmanian shortbread' or `proudly Tasmanian', which are covered by section 65VJ, or statements like `brewed in Hobart' which fall within section 65VG. The bill has no provision which governs the placement, size or number of these representations, provided the goods really are Australian. The supplementary explanatory memorandum clarifies this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that the phase-in period for the legislation be extended from 12 months to 18 months. I accept this recommendation and the government will be moving an amendment to the bill to effect this change. The committee also recommended that, where labelling changes are considered prohibitively expensive, producers be allowed to seek exemption for a further 12 months. The government's view is that, in a market where producers regularly change packaging and labelling for design or image reasons or because they are running a competition, 18 months seems more than enough time to make whatever changes are necessary to meet the requirements of the legislation. It is also unlikely that producers order labelling or packaging for periods of more than 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that I say something about the inter-relationship between the requirements of the Codex Alimentarius and the bill. The Codex Alimentarius Commission is a United Nations body which develops food standards for adoption as national standards by member countries. Australia is a member. As a food matter, Codex comes within the responsibility of the Minister for Human Resources and Health and the National Food Authority. The committee received advice from the National Food Authority on this very question and I can add nothing to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to that advice, Australia's obligation under Codex is to adopt Codex standards to the extent possible. Its standard for the origin labelling of food is that, when food undergoes processing in a second country which changes its nature, the processing country shall be considered to be the country of origin for labelling purposes. This requirement is clearly different from and possibly less rigorous than what is currently required under Australian law for `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree wholeheartedly with the committee's conclusion that it would not be in Australia's interest to allow imported food, which had undergone minimal processing in Australia, to be labelled `Made in Australia' if the use of that term was likely to mislead consumers and be contrary to Australian law. As the bill makes no change to the meaning of `Made in Australia', we are already out of step, to this extent, with the Codex standard. Our definitions are more rigorous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives a special definition to the term `Product of Australia', so that Australian industry and consumers can identify all-Australian products. The committee accepted that the terms we have chosen and the meanings ascribed to them are the most practical and appropriate labels. But some members of the committee have also expressed concern that Australia is doing something different from the rest of the world and that this will rebound on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the bill is concerned, it has no implications for our obligations under GATT. Evidence to the committee from officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade made this quite clear. This is because the bill does not define what `Made in another country' or `Product of another country' means. Other countries may go on using those terms to mean whatever is acceptable to them on goods which will be imported into Australia. We have legislated for what claims can be made about Australia in the Australian market. This is surely our prerogative. We have been careful to do this in a way which will not impact on our trading partners, except to stop them misleading Australian consumers. The fear of retaliation is therefore quite unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that I have answered all the concerns of the committee about this important piece of legislation. The bill gives consumers what they have been demanding&mdash;a means of identifying all-Australian goods and the removal of the confusion arising from the wide variety of terms currently used to claim Australian origin. It does this in a way which protects Australian jobs and supports Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the bill to the House and hope you read it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is regrettable that after the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) speaks we are no closer to resolving the concerns of the Australian consumers. Undoubtedly, that will be brought out again within the next 24 hours. We are debating today the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994, which the government has at last introduced into the parliament. There has been long and sustained criticism and calls for origin labelling to be addressed. This has come from all sectors of Australian life including the Trade Practices Commission which, for over a decade, has been decrying the lack of uniformity in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has undergone a long journey over the last two years. It has been through two government working parties and a House of Representatives and Senate inquiry. However, the bill as it appears today has been the subject of much criticism from the Australian public, Australian workers, producers and processors. I will be drawing to the attention of the House the comments, concerns and quite vehement criticism of a large number of people within those groups. The labelling of Australian products is an issue about which the Australian public has strong, definite and sincere opinions. Basically, the Australian public has requested that, if Australian goods make the claim to be Australian, then that is what they must be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way the government has presented this legislation has not met these expectations. The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill seeks to introduce a new voluntary scheme to govern labelling on domestic consumer goods that represent they have an Australian content. It does this by inserting a new division 1B into part V&mdash;the fair trading section&mdash;of the Trade Practices Act. At the moment, no specific requirements clearly define the terms to be used on goods that claim to have Australian content. Presently, country of origin labelling is mainly covered by section 53(eb) of the Trade Practices Act, which creates a specific offence for the making of a false or misleading representation concerning the place of origin of goods. Honourable members may not be aware that penalties are set at $100,000 for corporations and $20,000 for individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide range of terms are currently in use to describe the Australian content in goods, but members of the public have always maintained that they want to know whether the goods they are buying are Australian and they want the labels to contain the truth. This bill therefore attempts to specify and define the terms and conditions under which varying amounts of Australian content can be described. Australian producers and industry are rightly proud of their Australian product. It is known for its high quality, clean and green content, and is the result of generations of research and development into the ensuing excellent product. This is what the Australian public recognises, responds to and wishes to buy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These same qualities have been the subject of government promotion campaigns, whether it be in the push for Australian goods into Asia or the Buy Australian campaign, which over the last year the government has spent $15 million promoting and educating the public about. When I say that the government has spent $15 million, we should remember that it is $15 million of taxpayers' and consumers' money. Therefore, it was with alarm that the government, through this bill, introduced a category `Made in Australia', which ran counter to all these moves. Under the government bill, there are two categories for Australian goods. Category A, called `Produce/Product of Australia', covers goods where Australia is the place of origin of each major ingredient or component. Under this category, all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. Category B, called `Made in Australia', covers goods that acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, under this legislation, goods with lesser Australian content may state this on the label. If the goods do not qualify for the above categories, the label may describe the production or pre-production step that took place in Australia, plus identify the place of origin of the components or ingredients. This would lead to a description such as `Packed/ assembled/built in Australia from imported/Australian ingredients'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All other terms that describe the Australian content of the goods will be prohibited. The only other permitted labelling under this bill is the use of the Australian made certification mark. The green and gold triangle kangaroo logo can be used if combined with category A or category B descriptors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For goods with Australian and foreign representations, the foreign representation must be as prominent and as close as possible to the Australian representation. The coalition supports the government's proposal of goods in category A being labelled as `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia' where all major ingredients or components originate in Australia and all manufacturing has taken place in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not define the word `major', and there is an element of uncertainty as to what `major' means. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what will be considered major, or minor, will vary depending on the type of product. For example, in food products small amounts of imported seasonings and flavourings may be acceptable in a product labelled `Product of Australia', but in electronic goods the smallest components may be the most vital to the operation of the product.</PARA>
<PARA>Also the minister has reassured the House and Senate inquiries that this will be discussed with industry and dealt with when the guidelines are being drawn up in consultation with industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With goods described as `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia', the public can be assured that the label clarifies that the goods are virtually wholly Australian. However, with the next main Australian category in the government's bill, `Made in Australia', the minister on various occasions when describing the scheme has described this category as covering a situation where products have components of which some or even all&mdash;I stress `even all'&mdash;are imported but the goods are made here. With such products being labelled `Made in Australia' questions have to be asked. Do these products truthfully describe their Australian condition and content? Is this what the public understands a product labelled `Made in Australia' means? Is this the understanding of Australian consumers when they set out to deliberately buy an Australian product, as so many of them are now doing? I say to them, `Hear, hear!' On this side of the House, we encourage them to do so. Our amendments when they are passed by the Senate, as we believe they will be, will ensure that when they go shopping they will know they are buying Australian made when it says `Australian made'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Survey after survey supports the understanding of `Made in Australia' as being, in the main, a truly Australian product. According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quadrant</EMPHASIS> survey, 74 per cent of consumers believe products labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. The recent CSIRO national nutrition survey found that 98 per cent of people agreed that food should not be labelled `Australian made' unless it was both grown and processed entirely in Australia. The Coles survey showed that 89 per cent of shoppers, up from 86 per cent the previous year, preferred to buy locally manufactured food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many problem areas with the inclusion of imported ingredients or components in the category `Made in Australia'. Objections have been raised arising from situations such as imported Canadian pork being processed into ham and bacon in Australia and sold as being made in Australia; from orange and other imported fruit concentrates in varying proportions being blended in Australia and called `Made in Australia'; with non-Australian peanuts becoming `Made in Australia' peanut butter; similarly with foreign sourced dried fruit in cereals and biscuits; with imported paper cut to size in Australia and sold as `Made in Australia'; with both imported tomatoes and navy beans made into `Made in Australia' baked beans; and with overseas fruit being made into `Made in Australia' pies. The list goes on and most of these products mentioned have been or still are the subject of anti-dumping and countervailing actions and duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be honesty and truth in the labelling or the whole point of having country of origin labelling legislation is defeated. Accordingly, the coalition proposes to put forward amendments to proposed section 65VE(2). These amendments will reclassify `Made in Australia' into category A, and consequently goods labelled as `Made in Australia' must also meet the conditions of Australia being the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods must have happened in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Category B will then be labelled as `Manufactured in Australia' and will have to meet the conditions of the goods acquiring their essential character or qualities in Australia. This category will not require the imported contents to be listed on the label, although it will have a larger proportion of non-Australian ingredients or components than category A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is proposed in the government bill that when only a production or pre-production step has taken place in Australia the imported components or ingredients must be stated when the products claim on their label to have some Australian content. Goods which qualify under the separate requirement for the Australian made logo can simultaneously display it if they also qualify under this legislation for the labels `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia', `Made in Australia' or `Manufactured in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has run a most successful campaign to promote the Australian made campaign. It has spent $15 million of taxpayers' money over the last eight years promoting the Australian product to the Australian consumer. In this year's budget the campaign received a further $1.5 million. The minister has expressed her concern that jobs would be lost if the Australian made logo could not be used on all qualifying goods. The coalition amendments will achieve the same result as the government bill in this regard, which also restricted it to goods that acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. The minister need have no further fears of job loss or loss of effectiveness of the government's Australian made campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the government amendment to allow the addition of a regional name to the category A and category B labels, which the government has foreshadowed in its report to the Senate inquiry. The dissenting report from the coalition members of the Senate committee stressed the need for regional differentiation to be allowed. This amendment will allow the regional distinction to appear on the official label with labels such as `Product of Australia&mdash;Tasmania' or `Made in Australia&mdash;Margaret River'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area covered by the Trade Practices Act on origin labelling is complex and faces the difficult task of being the solution of all things to all interests. Australian industry has, in the vast majority of cases, been supportive of bringing certainty to the area by means of specific labels for specific conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian work force and union movement, in a most vocal and forceful way, have criticised the government's definition of `Made in Australia' and asked for change, as has much of Australian primary and secondary industry, which will have to bear the cost of adopting and adjusting to the new scheme.

If we listen to any talkback radio show, time after time people are saying, `I want to be guaranteed that when I buy a product that says "Made in Australia" it is wholly made in Australia.' We can talk about all these peripheral issues, but that is the guts of this question and it remains unanswered in this legislation. When we get to further debate about the amendments, I will proceed with that matter even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer the minister a large olive branch. If she comes on board with these amendments I will publicly go out and praise her for seeing commonsense in relation to this legislation. I might even join forces with Mr Martin Ferguson. We might duly go out together, stand on the same stage and say, `The minister has finally listened to the workers of Australia, the farmers of Australia, the producers of Australia and the consumers of Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a coup it would be for this House to realise and accept that the government's legislation is doing no more than condemning the Australian public to a situation where it will come out of this legislation with no clearer view of what `Made in Australia' means. This comes at a time when this country is desperately trying to get itself back on its feet, desperately trying to encourage people to buy Australian, desperately trying to encourage Australian farmers and manufacturers. For us to come out of this process without any clearer view about labelling in this country and about what `Made in Australia' means would be an extraordinary tragedy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would rather talk about the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 because it is very important. A lot of consideration has been given to the matters before us. I am particularly pleased to rise and support this bill, which amends the Trade Practices Act 1974. It has been a long time coming. It is a relief to finally see this bill before the House. Hopefully, there will be some sensible debate. I am sure there will be from this side, anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was certainly gratifying to read the majority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the bill, which recommended the legislation be passed with the amendments already proposed by the government. Perhaps we can finally get some work done on this bill, provided that the opposition sees fit to lend some bipartisan support for this important piece of legislation. Given the comments made earlier today, and the press release that Senator Boswell put out in the last 24 hours, it does not appear that there will be much support. It is certainly a pleasure to support legislation that makes it easier for Australians to buy Australian. There is no doubt about the commitments of members on this side of the House to Australia and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 is to help introduce a scheme that will govern representations about the origin of consumer goods. The bill seeks to do this by amending part 5 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 in order to deal with the method of labelling goods which are claimed to be made, manufactured, packed or designed in Australia. The bill focuses on representations made about Australian origin on consumer goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme set out in the bill focuses on representations about Australian origin carried on consumer goods supplied in Australia. This scheme will not be applicable to goods intended for export nor does it make any provision about representations on imported goods. Only where imported goods make some statement that could be construed as representing Australian origin does the bill require that further information be provided regarding the national origin of the product. This is a particularly important aspect of this bill. We are all no doubt aware of stories about souvenir items, such as toy kangaroos, which masquerade as Australian products but which, in reality, come from Taiwan and Korea in most cases. We have all seen them on sale, complete with Australian flags or pictures of kangaroos, when the only thing that happened here was that it was packed in this country. We have even seen members of the opposition displaying Australian flags where the stems on which those flags were sitting were made in Taiwan. We need to be conscious of that. Consumers deserve the right to know when they are buying Australian, and this bill will help them in that endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of labelling generally has had a long history and covers not only the place of origin of goods. Unfortunately, no thorough and uniform scheme covering those areas has evolved. The lack of any comprehensive uniform scheme governing such conduct has been the subject of criticism from all quarters for a considerable period. This bill seeks to standardise that situation. As early as 1977, the report by the Trade Practices Commission on packaging and labelling laws in Australia was particularly scathing about the lack of uniformity in the area. It commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No system of State legislative implementation will succeed in any long term, reasonably efficient sense. If Australia cannot obtain packaging and labelling, and contents legislation of a uniform nature, it is an admission that Australia is not a common market. The small nature of Australian production runs is not problem enough. To subdivide these runs into runs by each individual state because of varying requirements is the height of folly in any system of rational economic planning.</PARA>
<PARA>As far as country of origin labelling is concerned, the issue is regulated by a number of Commonwealth and state acts, supplemented by various voluntary schemes. The major influence on labelling comes from the misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Section 53 of that act specifically deals with false representations concerning the place or origin of goods. Typical descriptions which can be the subject of litigation under the act include `Made in Australia', `Produce of Australia' and `Packaged in Australia'. To date, there has been little litigation concerning the section, and it is clear from the reported cases that what the consumer understands by the phrase `Made in Australia' will vary on a case-by-case basis. It has been held that a good is `made' where it obtains its essential quality and character. Section 53(eb) is one provision which has been mirrored in all states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the Trade Practices Act 1974 provisions, standards dealing with labelling the country of origin can be made by the National Food Authority, established under the National Food Authority Act 1991. The NFA was established primarily to develop and recommend standards for food, although its objectives also include the provision of information to consumers about food and the promotion of fair trading practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is in force at present the Australian Food Standards Code which is adopted by reference under the food legislation of the states and territories. Clause A1(4) of the code requires all packaged foods to carry a statement of the country in which the food was made or produced. Where food contains ingredients which originate in another country, compliance with the clause occurs if the label identifies both the country where the food was packed and either the country of origin of the ingredients or the fact that the ingredients are imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the problems regarding labelling have arisen partly because the states and territories also have a complex network of legislation dealing with labelling requirements, which vary significantly from state to state. Although this lack of uniformity has been alleviated somewhat by the mutual recognition acts in all jurisdictions, the legislative framework applies in a piecemeal way to different types of goods in different states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in New South Wales, the Fair Trading (Product Information Standards) Regulation 1992 prescribes that leather goods made in Australia must be marked with `Made in Australia', `Manufactured by'&mdash;followed by the manufacturer and state&mdash;or marked with the country in which the goods were made. In Tasmania, the Goods (Trade Descriptions) Act 1971 prohibits the sale of boots or shoes manufactured outside of Australia, unless they bear a trade description citing the country of manufacture. In Queensland, the Fair Trading Regulations 1989 specifies that shoes manufactured overseas shall include the country of manufacture in figures at least 2.5 millimetres high on the outside sole, inside upper or heel of the sock lining. As you can see, this situation is just ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill that we are debating here is an admirable attempt to address this problem by introducing a rationalised scheme. It will rationalise the use of descriptions on labels to identify the `Australianness' of goods sold on the domestic market. The fact that it will not only support individual manufacturers but will also help provide a boost to the national economy by making it easier for Australian consumers to buy Australian products is an added benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As tariff barriers have fallen, country of origin labelling has become an important political issue. Increased imports may lead to local job losses, as local producers are forced to compete with products from countries which can sell their products in Australia at much lower prices. As a result, local producers have increasingly sought to emphasise attributes of locally made goods, other than price. The government has supported this aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1986, the federal government has directly funded a campaign to encourage Australian consumers to buy more locally produced goods. The allocation for the Australian made program for the current financial year is just over $1.5 million. But it is important to realise that, without clear guidelines for identifying locally sourced goods and services, any campaign to encourage consumers to buy Australian will be a waste of time, resources and energy and, indeed, will lack credibility in the eyes of Australian consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, producers have sought to increase consumer hostility to imported goods by emphasising `buying Australian' to `preserve jobs' and using sophisticated marketing techniques and logos which suggest strong local ties to the particular product. Importers and others in the industry have been able to tap in on these methods to some extent by generating confusion as to what trade descriptions such as `Made in Australia' mean, thereby taking advantage of any consumer goodwill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second reading speech for the National Food Authority Bill 1991, the then Minister for the Aged, Family and Health Services, Peter Staples, announced that the authority would conduct a wide-ranging review of policy for setting food standards. The terms of reference for the review, issued in July 1992, under section 11 of the National Food Authority Act 1991, included the authority's role in informing and educating consumers. This part of the report covered the country of origin labelling question. The NFA received submissions from numerous interested parties and organisations, and the report was presented in May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority discussed the origin labelling question, stating that it was considering whether to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">require a consistent declaration of ingredient origin across all foods;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">clarify the intent and operation of the provisions relating to statements which identify the country in which a food is packed for retail sale;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">define any terms used in country of origin declarations which require definition.</PARA>
<PARA>On the origin labelling issue, the NFA states that it believes that country of origin labelling requirements should be consistent with general consumer goods, but that the Australian Food Standards Code should be the primary means of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At around the same time as the establishment of the NFA inquiry, the minister requested the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs to prepare a discussion paper dealing specifically with the origin labelling question. In October 1992, the FBCA established two working groups to study the problem. These groups had been amalgamated to one by the time the report was handed down. Parties to the working groups included a diverse range of federal statutory bodies, including the NFA. The terms of reference of the groups included obtaining consumer and business opinions of the existing legislative regime, establishing the scale of compliance costs with the existing regime, and developing country of origin descriptions and legislative provisions for their enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After hearing submissions from the states and territories and industry and consumer groups, the working committee report was published in May 1993. The committee's findings included that the current system was confusing and imposed conflicting requirements for labelling across jurisdictions, and that no scheme would be able to satisfy all the interests of consumers, suppliers and governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's recommendations included that a new division be inserted into the TPA to deal with origin labelling; that the division contain descriptions to be used, but that labelling be mandatory only for specified classes of goods; and that the states and territories be encouraged to enact legislation mirroring the new division. Also, the preferred scheme for labelling was found to be an essential character test. Goods could be labelled `Made in Australia' only if they acquired their essential character in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response was this bill, which picks up particular aspects of the report's recommendations. Of most significance was the adoption of the preferred labelling scheme outlined above, which was roundly attacked by a wide cross-section of community groups. In launching the scheme, the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) stated that government research had shown that consumers were primarily interested in who made the product and that the scheme would give consumers `what they really want'&mdash;and, of course, that is an Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this bill the following changes are proposed. Clause 3 inserts a new division 1B into part 5 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Proposed section 65VC defines the carrying of a representation as when a representation is applied to goods or their packaging or labelling. Proposed section 65VD limits the application of the division to consumer goods supplied by a corporation in trade and commerce. Consumer goods are defined as goods acquired for ordinary personal, domestic or household use or consumption, or goods costing less than the prescribed amount&mdash;currently $40,000. The division does not apply to goods supplied outside of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 65VE prohibits representations as to origin other than those in proposed subsection 65VE(2). The legitimate descriptions are `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' and `Made in Australia', and the subsection specifies the criteria for their use. These criteria include the controversial `essential character' test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 65VF excludes from proposed section 65VE goods which carry the representation logo `Australian Made' as part of the Australian made certification mark. Proposed section 65VG prohibits the supply of goods which have representations that a production step took place in Australia, unless an additional representation as to the place of origin is also made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 65VH prohibits the supply of goods with representations about Australian pre-production steps, unless the goods carry at least another representation. The other representations can either be those in proposed section 65VE, a representation that identifies the fact that production steps happened in Australia, or a representation that the place of origin of the goods is outside Australia. Proposed section 65VK deals with goods which have both foreign origin representations and Australian representations. This provision ensures that the representations are of similar prominence and that information as to origin is easily accessible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major benefit of this bill is to increase the level of awareness among the public and consumers of the accuracy of the `Australian Made' claim on many products. It is in fact an education campaign. This is necessary because, up until now, the labelling standards have caused difficulty and confusion not only for consumers but also for industry. Once the legislation is passed, the education campaign can begin in earnest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new guidelines will set a new standard in simplicity and clarity. Goods claiming to be Australian will carry one of two basic descriptions: `Product of Australia', referring to goods made by Australian workers from Australian materials or components; or `Made in Australia', referring to goods made by Australian workers from materials or components that may have been imported but have gained their essential character here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the products cannot qualify for either of these terms, they will have to describe the Australian stage of their production process&mdash;for instance, `Assembled in Australia', `Sewn in Australia' or `Packaged in Australia'. These labels will also have to state that the material or components are imported. These new labelling laws will reflect the widespread desire among consumers to know both the source and production process of the goods. They will also help consumers spend their money in a way that will help create or sustain Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the bill first surfaced, there have been several delays in presenting it to the House and, during that time, the Minister for Consumer Affairs undertook to consult widely with consumer and producers' groups, and the bill itself has been referred to two committees for scrutiny. As a result, the government has made some minor amendments which should not only satisfy consumers and producers&mdash;and we hope the opposition, but that is very unlikely&mdash;but which also, in my opinion, make it an even stronger piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the government amendments is to provide for the identification of particular places within Australia or of particular parts of Australia in the label stating the Australian origin. For instance, the delicious dairy products from King Island and Tasmania generally will still be able to use that as a promotional tool on their labels, provided that they are used in conjunction with the other labels proposed in this bill, namely: `Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia' or `Made in Australia'. There is an amendment to add section 65VG so that where goods carry a representation identifying a production step which occurred in Australia, they must identify the place of origin of the goods or the place of origin of the components or ingredients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international cost competitiveness is at a record high, so we are faced with wonderful opportunities in the future to create new export markets and expand existing ones. A leading economist, Dr John Marsden, has estimated that producers participating in the past `Australian Made' campaigns generated about $4 billion in sales, or 2.3 per cent of manufacturing turnover. This success seems to indicate that the `Australian Made' symbol could be of enormous benefit in overseas marketing and promotion in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government research indicates that the scheme we are debating in this bill shows that consumers are happy with this scheme. They do not want to know what is in goods; they want to know where a product comes from and whether or not, by buying it, they will be helping young Australians&mdash;even their own children&mdash;to get jobs in the future. This is supported by research conducted by Ramis Corporation, which showed how strongly more Australians are feeling about the importance of supporting Australian made goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity to rise to support this legislation today. As I said earlier, it has been a long time coming. I would hope that the bill put before the House by the Minister for Consumer Affairs and the amendments she has proposed here today are supported by the House. Clearly, the opposition needs to come to terms with this matter. I think it is almost a case of just rejecting legislation for the sake of rejecting legislation. The furphies that were put forward by the previous speaker absolutely amazed me. He claimed that he would have the support of the ACTU, which I doubt very much.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill has taken a long while to again come before the House. The country of origin labelling issue has been the subject of two working groups and the government bill has been the subject of both a House of Representatives and a Senate committee of inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, of which I am the deputy chairman. I had the honour to present our report to the House on 6 June 1994. At the time of tabling the committee's report, I said that the bill posed more questions than it answered. That situation has not changed. I would have thought that, after that committee's report to the Minister for Consumer Affairs, which raised a whole host of problems and issues that needed resolution, it could have been addressed by the minister and the matter resolved. But it is quite obvious that the minister is not listening to the people in industry, and she certainly has not undertaken the consultation processes that the coalition has undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has talked with many people in the food processing industry, the Confectionary Manufacturers of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia, the Victorian Farmers Federation, the Food Policy Alliance, the National Farmers Federation, and a whole host of individual industries. The coalition is getting a clear and consistent message from industry and a clear and concise summary of what is required in this legislation. It is certainly not what the government and the minister are putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister obviously would have been approached by all of these organisations. But it is quite clear that either she is not listening to them or she is locked into a mind-set which she refuses to shift from. The requirements and the amendments that have been put forward by the coalition seek to address the issues that have been brought before it by these organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no present requirements that prescribe or clearly define the terms to be used to describe products with Australian content. The present meaning of `Made in Australia' is as determined by the courts, which broadly encompasses the `essential character' test. Section 53EB of the Trade Practices Act presently creates a specific offence for a firm which makes a false or misleading representation concerning the place of origin of goods. As well, the Food Standards Code regulates country of origin labelling for food. This bill attempts to define the terms and conditions under which goods claiming varying amounts of Australian content can be described. It does so by a number of methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is suggesting that the bill should be amended so that proposed subsection 65VE(2) relating to `Product/Produce of Australia' and `Made in Australia' form category A, to meet conditions where all the major ingredients or components are Australian and all operations in manufacturing and processing occur in Australia. Category B, `Manufactured in Australia', would be for goods that acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be a new table in proposed subsection 65VE(2). Category A would have three representations&mdash;`Produce of Australia', `Product of Australia', or `Made in Australia'&mdash;all ranking equally. The condition under which goods would be in that category would be that Australia would be the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under category B, `Manufactured in Australia', the goods acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. To me, that clearly identifies what is required in an honest approach to origin labelling. It is very clearly spelt out. This would give Australian consumers a very clear understanding of what is required and what they are purchasing&mdash;whether it be food or any other product. They would see an honest appraisal on the label and would know exactly under what conditions those products were manufactured and in which country they were manufactured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the other descriptions in the bill, such as labels describing the production and pre-production process&mdash;for example, packed, blended or built in Australia from imported ingredients or components&mdash;would be followed, as would the use of the `Australian Made' logo on category A and B goods and the provision regarding symbols, words and pictures on foreign goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have provided the minister with reasons for our putting forward an amendment. The amendment allows the contentious label `Made in Australia' to reflect the understanding and the perceptions of the Australian community. The perception of `Made in Australia' is that Australia is the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and that all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happen in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of surveys conducted by various organisations support the fact that this is the understanding of the Australian public. The Quadrant survey found that 74 per cent of consumers believe that products labelled `Made in Australia' should not contain imported ingredients. The CSIRO national nutrition survey in January 1994 found that 98 per cent agreed that food should not be labelled `Australian Made' unless it was both grown and processed entirely within Australia. The Coles survey in October 1993 found that 89 per cent&mdash;which was up from 86 per cent the previous year&mdash;prefer to buy locally manufactured food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have supporting evidence from organisations that we have consulted with, such as the National Farmers Federation. Its news release of 19 October 1994 headed `Opposition right on country of origin labelling' reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Farmers' Federation has commended the Federal Opposition for its move to change proposed labelling laws to more accurately reflect the origin of a product, including its components and ingredients.</PARA>

<PARA>The President of the National Farmers Federation, Mr Donald McGauchie, said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition's amendments will ensure that "Made in Australia" means exactly what it says.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really what the public want. The public, particularly Australian consumers, want to know that the labelling is accurate and unambiguous and that the information about the country of origin is consistent on all product labels. That was the view of the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Farmers Federation had a similar view. It was also consulted and has done a tremendous amount of work in this area. As the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) said earlier, the Victorian Farmers Federation formed an unusual alliance with the ACTU, and they were united in their views on this matter. That takes quite a bit of achieving, but it can be done. It was done in this instance because it reflected a commonsense and accurate approach to how labelling should appear on products made in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a copy of a press release put out by SPC. I have had discussions with Mr John Corboy, the Chairman of SPC Ltd, on this important matter. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SPC News</EMPHASIS> of 19 October 1994 indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moves by the Federal Coalition and the Democrats to amend the Federal Government's controversial MADE IN AUSTRALIA labelling legislation is a victory for commonsense and a positive initiative which would be welcomed by every Australian farmer and consumer, Australian food manufacturer SPC said today.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly it will be welcomed by farmers and consumers. It will also be welcomed by a whole range of other industries. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined attack on the legislation by the Coalition and the Democrats now means the Federal Government's Made In Australia Labelgate legislation will not be passed in the Senate without appropriate changes.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that Mr Corboy performed a minor miracle&mdash;maybe a major miracle&mdash;in Australia by revitalising the old established SPC company, which is now trading successfully on the international market. He has put his record on the line and understands what the food industry and the manufacturing industry are about. The release continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Corboy said: "The protection of the Made in Australia trademark because of its national importance is a cornerstone to underpinning future employment in Australia."</PARA>
<PARA>Isn't that what we all want? We want to increase employment opportunities in Australia by manufacturing Australian products and by using Australian produce or products of Australia. We want to have products clearly labelled so that the consumers understand exactly what the labelling system means. If they buy a product in Australia and read on the label that it is made in Australia, their perception is that the product came from Australia and was in fact produced here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone has any reason to doubt that, they have only to look at the enormous amount of money that the government has spent in promoting the made in Australia campaign. Over the last eight years it has spent well in excess of $15 million on a public education campaign to reinforce the message that `Made in Australia' means that the product or the produce is produced here in Australia, that it is manufactured and developed in Australia and that it is an Australian product, which is the perception and understanding of Australian consumers. The government spent all of that money on an education campaign, and that is now the clear perception of the consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Ballarat mentioned the firm Rocklea, which spins cotton and wool products in Australia. It just happens to have a very good plant in my electorate of Bendigo which employs a substantial number of people. It is doing some very exciting things in developing Australian technology. It is combining cotton with wool and spinning some very innovative products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rocklea also supports the approach that is being taken by the opposition on this issue of country of origin labelling. In its letter it spelt out that this will lead to greater employment opportunities, and it also made reference to cotton from overseas that was being dumped here. Rocklea is strongly in support of these amendments that are being proposed by the opposition as it knows they will lead to further employment opportunities for Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Ballarat also mentioned Golden Circle, a very well-known Australian product. A press release from Golden Circle which was issued on 18 October 1994 was headed `Call for clear "Made in Australia" labelling' and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Golden Circle Limited has called on the Federal Government to ensure that the labelling statement `Made in Australia' means just what it says.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Golden Circle is concerned by proposed legislation which would allow products carrying the Made in Australia label to actually contain up to 25% of imported ingredients.</PARA>
<PARA>How could we possibly allow that to happen? We must have some honesty, something that is unambiguous and something that the consumer understands. Mr Barry Kelly, the Managing Director of Golden Circle, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think Australians have an expectation that only goods actually made in Australia, with all-Australian ingredients, should be allowed to carry the endorsement of `Made in Australia'.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is perceived and understood by most consumers. When they walk into a store and look at a product which has `Made in Australia' on it, their understanding and their perception is that the goods were made in Australia with all-Australian ingredients and therefore are allowed to carry the endorsement `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some major worldwide changes in regional labelling and the identification of regional products. If you look at the wine industry in France, you will see how important regional labelling is. It is important that the amendment we are proposing allows regional labelling to follow categories A and B; that is, Produce/Product of Australia&mdash;Tasmania; Made in Australia&mdash;Margaret river; or Manufactured in Australia&mdash;Bendigo. These regional identifications should be used. They will become very important in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the wine industry because some French names which are used for wines in Australia will become illegal as they relate to regions in France. Those regional areas are protected in France and this will mean that Australia will have to concentrate on its regional labelling as a marketing tool worldwide. There is no doubt that Australian wines are becoming more acceptable worldwide and that the wine export markets are building up. The amendment that has been put forward by the coalition also authorises the use of the Tasmanian trademark `Produce of Tasmania' as the only trademark for Tasmanian products, which would have been prohibited by the bill but which should be accepted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has gone down a long path. I do not know whether the minister has learnt anything from it at all. I think the minister is resisting the changes which everyone in industry accepts as being honest and unambiguous. The amendments being put forward by the coalition will bring that about. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak on this most important piece of legislation, the Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill. On the face of it, it may seem to be a legalistic change to the Trade Practices Act, but it signifies, to a great extent, another step forward in our recognition of the importance of our identity as Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much work has been carried out over the last few years to promote Australian products to recognise the quality of the goods produced in our own country. However, it was not that long ago that we looked to other countries to produce goods which were considered to be of real quality. If it was imported it must be good; if it was local it was not. It was no doubt part of what was known as the cultural cringe&mdash;the inferiority complex which we suffered as a nation to a great extent for so many years. As a student of history perhaps I could trace this back to our origins as a convict settlement, but this is probably not the place to look for reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago I had the privilege of living in the United Kingdom and in Europe for a considerable number of years. It was interesting for me, having travelled so far, to observe the national spirit and the feeling of identity which was so pronounced in some countries. I lived in that part of the world during the entry of Britain into what was then the European Common Market. I watched the withdrawal of Britain from its traditional markets of Australia and New Zealand from the other side. It was an interesting exercise because it showed me that each country has its right to be proud of what it produces and the commonsense of trading in those products and services which are better produced in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a right to be proud of what it produces and what it creates. We have a great store of inventiveness and creativity. Although we do not always recognise the people who create new innovations in technology, I think we have reached the stage of maturity where we can exploit the natural products and the creativity of our own people while allowing those of other nations to produce the things which we are not able to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be cases where Australian is best and cases where imported is best. We need perhaps to look no further than the example of Scotch whisky, some may say an example which is close to my heart. The Australian product will never be quite as good not because we do not have the technical know-how but because we do not have the particular environment or historical expertise of Scotland to produce this unique product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having recognised that what we produce is worthy of recognition, this bill sets out how we let the community know that these are our products and that we are proud of them. The requirements of this bill make it very clear that producers of goods can no longer use the words of their choice which, in many cases, have been misleading. With a universal system of labelling with clear definitions, there will be no doubt about the meaning. Consumers will get much more of a fair go when it comes to making decisions about what they buy. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) has stated that this will be:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a simple labelling scheme that would not only help consumers identify Australian goods, but also make it easier for Australian suppliers to promote Australian products and create Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA>The end result has come after a considerable period of consultation and the examination of public submissions. It would seem from the words we are getting from the other side that that still has not been long enough or that the message has not got through. Various consumer groups as well as individual consumers, industry groups, primary producers and retailers have been involved in this consultation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system of labelling will be simple and direct. There will be basically two labels, no As and Bs. They will be: `Made in Australia' and `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia'. Because these are simple and direct, they are designed to overcome the myriad of misleading labels which currently exist. Unfortunately, there are those who want to complicate these simple labels&mdash;and I think we have heard that enough from the other side this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, it is quite understandable that there are those who want a more defined explanation of the meaning of `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia'. However, the legislation will be accompanied by an education program and a lead-in time for industry compliance of 18 months. During this time, the public should be left in no doubt as to the meaning of these words and what they can expect if they buy a product with these labels attached. The scheme does not apply to goods intended for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme proposes to set the terms and conditions for making a claim about the Australian content or nature of goods. It will also control the use of potentially misleading misrepresentation on labels, such as maps and Australian symbols. In addition, it will require that origin labels are clearly legible and visible to consumers. They are there to assist consumers and also to assist manufacturers wanting to make claims of Australian origin or content. These goods which are all Australian&mdash;that is, that the major components or ingredients have originated in Australia and any processing has been done in this country&mdash;would be labelled `Product or produce of Australia'. This will be viewed as the ultimate Australian label. Unfortunately, it is the label that has the least prominence so far. Naturally, it would apply to fresh produce, such as fruit, which is grown in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `Made in Australia' label on the other hand will identify goods which have been manufactured, assembled or put together into a finished product in Australia. The ingredients which go into these products may be partly grown or supplied in Australia or may include imported components or ingredients. The key to the character of this particular label is that, to qualify for the `Made in Australia' label, goods must have acquired their essential characteristics or qualities in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of what would qualify under this particular title has been framed from court judgments in cases brought by the Trade Practices Commission which involve false or misleading representations about the place of origin of goods. To assist industry in making decisions about whether a product qualifies for the `Made in Australia' label, the Trade Practices Act will include a list of principles which have been extracted from these court judgments. These include such issues as where the goods acquired their essential function, shape, dimension or appearance; where the goods underwent major processing; where the goods acquired the qualities the manufacturer is promoting; and the consumer's understanding of the phrase `Made in Australia' in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, there will be goods which fall under neither the `Product of Australia' nor the `Made in Australia' definition. These goods may have been assembled in Australia, packed, finished or blended in Australia, but do not meet the full requirement of the `Made in the Australia' label. For these goods, labelling must be more specific and refer to the particular step in the production process which is Australian. However, it cannot use the general words `manufactured' or `produced' as they would conflict with the official labels. For example, it would be possible for a product to be labelled `Packed in Australia from imported ingredients'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those manufacturers who wish to give a clearer description of their product, it would be possible to add information to the major labels of `Made in Australia' or `Product of Australia'. This will be applicable in the case where an individual state or region wishes to make it known that craftsmen or particular workers in that state had a hand in the production of the product. It would not, as the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) has said, exclude those comments. Goods which have been designed in Australia and are labelled as such also will have to have a label indicating where the goods were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the preparation of this bill a lot of controversy has arisen both in the political arena and among manufacturers and consumers. Much of this has been scaremongering or purely misunderstanding of the meaning of the legislation. When a particular state wishes to promote its product there will be no conflict with this legislation. Much of the concern on this issue has been raised by Tasmanian companies which are, quite rightly, very proud of their produce. However, I hope by now they have been assured that they can still proudly label their products `Tasmanian' or `King Island' while still complying with this legislation. For example, when I visited Hobart recently I consumed considerable amounts of a local brand of mineral water. On the label it was marked in large print to be Tasmanian. However, it also complied with the new legislation, ahead of time, because in the corner of label it was marked `Product of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern which has arisen&mdash;and I have to say this has been fuelled by other political parties&mdash;is the issue of fresh produce brought into Australia which then undergoes a slight change before being packaged and labelled as `Made in Australia'. A classic example of this arose in my electorate, particularly after the Democrats' spokesman wrote a letter to my local paper. This concerned orange juice concentrate which is imported from South America. The contention was that this concentrate will have water added to it and will then be labelled `Made in Australia'. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said earlier, the goods must have gained their essential character as a product in Australia in order to qualify for the `Made in Australia' label. In this case the adding of water and packaging is not the essential character. This lies in the orange juice itself. This product could therefore not be labelled `Made in Australia'. If the manufacturer wishes to label it at all, it would have to state that it was imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of the gaining of essential character in a product is that of car tyres. Australia does not grow rubber. However, that should not stop the manufacture of tyres in Australia. The manufacture of tyres of high quality is something of which this country can be proud. It seems incongruous to me that tyres which are made in Australia from raw material which has been imported should not be marked `Made in Australia'. There is no way that the natural product of rubber can be supplied within Australia. There is equally no reason why Australian tyres, which are designed and manufactured in Australia by Australian workers, should be marked anything but `Made in Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the arguments I have heard from opponents of the bill have focused on the `Made in Australia' label. They say that goods which are labelled `Made in Australia' should be totally Australian or, if they are not, that the origin of the ingredients should be listed. None of these people has ever mentioned the other vital label which is covered by this bill and that is `Product or produce of Australia'. When the latter is seen on a product, and after the education campaign, we will know that it is made in Australia from Australian ingredients. Therefore, `Made in Australia' has a different definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is a similar definition to that which already exists under the Australian-made logo&mdash;that is, the familiar green triangle with the yellow kangaroo. The Advance Australia Council makes a decision on the level of Australianness which will qualify for the logo. However, these goods do not have to be manufactured in Australia of all Australian ingredients. Therefore, the new legislation in no way contravenes the Australian-made system with which we are all so familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if the opposition amendments go through, they could effectively destroy the Australian-made logo with which we are so familiar. The Advance Australia Council will be operating illegally by marking those goods `Australian made' and putting that logo on them. I hope that the opposition will realise that it will have on its conscience the jobs of many Australians. The legislation deals only with goods and products which claim to be Australian. Goods which are imported may display the country of origin, and for more discerning shoppers most of these products will now give an idea of the origin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the most important reason for introducing the scheme is to eliminate the false and misleading information which has been previously given on labels. One of the most important aims of this scheme is to identify Australian goods made by Australian workers. This is one of the key elements that apply to this legislation. The emphasis is on Australian jobs&mdash;jobs for Australians. It is hoped that it will encourage Australians to buy these goods and to support Australian jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labelling says nothing about who owns the company which has that manufactured the goods and in this context it is not important. The main emphasis is on the production of goods within Australia using Australian workers. An Australian company may manufacture its goods abroad or a foreign company established in Australia will use Australian workers to manufacture its goods here. What we are about is supporting Australian jobs within Australia and encouraging consumers to purchase these goods which will support those jobs. I therefore commend to the House the amendments to the Trade Practices Act which will enable these labels to become standard practice within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that discerning members in the other place will firmly reject the amendments that have been moved by the opposition. It is obvious that we need a further education campaign to show that the semantics set out in Senator Boswell's press release, which require labels to be of an A type or B type, do not make things clearer. How will that make things clearer and simpler? It will merely complicate them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are doing is substituting the word `made' for `manufactured'. Senator Boswell's proposal is absolutely ridiculous. The member for Bendigo has said that the perception in the community is that `Made in Australia' means made in Australia from all Australian ingredients. It clearly does not indicate that. If he were to talk to the Advance Australia Council and were to look at those goods with the green and gold label on them, he would find that many of those are not manufactured from all Australian ingredients. Those companies would be put out of business and the people that manufacture those products would inevitably have their jobs put in jeopardy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a matter which is hurting Cranbourne businesses both large and small&mdash;everyone from cleaning contractors to bedding shops. Over the past week there has been a lot of discussion about the ongoing Prices Surveillance Authority's inquiry into the future arrangements that should apply for the 51 companies that must presently seek that authority's permission for any price rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of intrusion by a government agency can cost a lot of money and often consumers end up no better off. One example of that is the beer market. Even though there are only two major brewers, Fosters and Lyon Nathan, the latter being known as Tooheys, they fight head to head for every slab that is sold. Often at Dan Murphy, Phillip Murphy or similar shops the retail price of a slab will be massively discounted. In these situations it makes little sense to have a government agency cast in the role of approver of price rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to require the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor a particular industry, product or service. In Cranbourne, small businesses are in an unusual situation. Unlike their competitors in Berwick, Frankston, Dandenong or Mt Eliza, Cranbourne homes and businesses are in the 059 telephone area. Of course, they can use Telecom's community call facility to speak at cheaper than normal STD rates. However, Cranbourne small businesses still face a problem. Many of their potential or actual customers might live in the Melbourne telephone area. Most business people would know that business directories such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne Big</EMPHASIS> are an effective way to reach people looking for goods and services. So many Cranbourne businesses have to advertise in both the 03 and the 059 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> and perhaps <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne Big</EMPHASIS> or other directories as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past two years, however, the company that publishes the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>, Pacific Access Pty Ltd, which is 51 per cent owned by Telstra&mdash;or Telecom&mdash;with the remainder owned in equal shares by the US companies Volt and South Western Bell, the Dutch company YP Publishing and the Australian company Edward H. O'Brien have treated Cranbourne businesses differently from Melbourne businesses. In the 009 region directory <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>, advertising rates showed that the cost of an advertisement that covers an eighth of a page has increased by almost 6 per cent between 1993 and 1995 editions. The Australian inflation rate over the same period was only 3.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in Melbourne, for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne Big</EMPHASIS>, a competitor to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS>, the price rise between December 1992 and 1994 editions has been adjusted by just under four per cent for the same advertisement. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> may well argue that their rates are low by international standards but the fact is that they can increase their prices under this government without having to run the risk of the Prices Surveillance Authority objecting to the price rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> have a huge market power. In Cranbourne they are a monopoly. In Melbourne they have about three quarters of what is understood to be a $100 million cake of advertising in business directories. Bill Scales, the Chairman of the Industry Commission, would probably agree that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> meet the stringent tests for what sort of businesses should be subject to prices surveillance, and he does not believe there are many. Yet incredibly under this Labor government, which preaches compassion, the Assistant Treasurer allows his friends at Telecom to escape any sort of government scrutiny with their joint venture company Pacific Access. Until we know what the new policy will be with the forthcoming establishment of the Australian competition commission the Assistant Treasurer should direct at the very least the Prices Surveillance Authority to monitor, or perhaps hold an inquiry into, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> prices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last rose in this House in the adjournment debate I referred to the great provincial manufacturing city of Geelong, which I represent in this parliament. I indicated that recently in Geelong there was some bad news and a lot of good news. The bad news was that we lost to the West Coast Eagles, and some Geelong supporters as well as West Coast supporters missed out on finals tickets. That is an issue that I see the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) has placed before the parliament. Hopefully it will be taken up at some time in the future. The good news related to the level of economic development which was taking place in the city of Geelong. I referred in that past adjournment speech to the recent jobs growth which had occurred and the improvement that had taken place in motor vehicle registrations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to other elements of the Geelong economy that have indicated some real signs of growth in recent times. I refer to an article that appeared on 7 October 1994 in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> entitled `Economic Outlook Becoming Brighter'. The city of greater Geelong in its report on the Geelong economy had indicated various sectors that had shown substantial growth in the previous quarter. One of those was the building sector. As I look around this House, I see the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), who sits opposite me here. He knows very well that the building industry is very important to regional areas and cities such as Geelong and to the city that he represents, Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Geelong, new business approvals over that quarter have increased by 10.8 per cent. We have seen their value increase by 21.2 per cent. That increase has comprised new home constructions. More importantly, we have seen a real surge in factory and shop development of over 40 per cent. The total value of that is some $14 million&mdash;$4.6 million on factories, $2.1 million on shops and $1.3 million on other business premises. This in itself is a heartening development, but it is the significance of this statistic that we ought to reflect upon. It means that in the city of greater Geelong at this point in time the private sector is beginning to invest in a very real sense. That is a cause for some optimism for people in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of growth that was mentioned in the economic outlook article was education. I refer to another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> entitled `Business boom for Deakin'&mdash;that is, Deakin University&mdash;which indicated that enrolments are expected to skyrocket by some 50 per cent in 1995 and will for the first time exceed 50,000 students. I am pleased to note that Deakin University is extending its activities into South East Asia. Recently on a parliamentary delegation I visited Singapore.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you know that I have previously spoken in this House about my abhorrence of ocean outfall and about sewage and effluent management. I was elected to this House on 13 March 1993. Since then, I have devoted myself to improving the quality of the environment and to developing the potential for the future growth of my electorate and to improving the living conditions of those in my electorate. As a surfer, one of those things has been ensuring that the purity of water along our coast is maintained for a number of reasons&mdash;not for my own selfish reason of wanting to surf in good, pristine waters but for the reason that tourism is one of the dominant industries along our coast. There is another reason; that is, the potential for mariculture along our coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since being elected, I have put forward the view that not only was this discharge into the ocean an environmental danger but also that it was a waste of a resource. Many people within that area, particularly the one-time mayor of Shoalhaven and others, thought that I was a dreamer, someone who was a sky pilot, whose head was so far up in the clouds that I could not see reality. Well, a lot has happened in that time. In fact, I have been able to attain a feasibility study on employment generated by effluent management and, subsequently, the re-use of water for agricultural purposes and for farm forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time of drought that we have now, it is exceedingly important that people realise something. I must admit, the drought is one of the things that has aided me in getting this message across. What has resoundingly come out of that study is that my ideas of using effluent as a resource have been sown amongst a number of groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first group was the Shoalhaven City Council, which was dead against the idea from the start. It said it was unfeasible and not possible. It has changed its view. The second group was that of landowners in the area. Those landowners now are supportive. The third group was that of the corporate sector. I had to go to Melbourne and other places to various sections of the corporate sector and I found that those people are prepared to attend meetings. In fact, on 31 October and 1 November a key group of people will come together to examine the prospects of future development within the scope of that feasibility study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite exciting because a number of things are coming out of it. I am putting forward the concept of a corporate entity which would comprise the Shoalhaven City Council, the landowners and the corporate sector. The Shoalhaven City Council, which represents the people, will have to put in an effluent management system anyway. Whether it pumps the effluent into the ocean or elsewhere, there is no difference in dollars. The landowners already own the land and therefore have a contribution to make to a corporate entity in terms of tying up dollars and cents or litres that they will be prepared to expend and use on their land. The third section is the corporate sector, which I have taken a great deal of time to interest and involve in this. In fact, a number of projects in other areas have interested them, but they have decided to have a good look at what we are proposing in our area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dream I still have is that of this corporate entity. Being a socialist I do not normally run with the capitalist system, but in this case practical reality says that we have to put those three elements together. I am happy that the people of Shoalhaven will in the long term benefit from that. Hopefully in the long term, when the trees and the value of that commodity comes through, they will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This meeting, which will take place on 31 October and 1 November, will set the ground rules for this corporation. This corporation will then own an intellectual product when it is all together. I am hoping that it will be able to go up and down the coast from Rockhampton to Lorne selling this. The jobs that will come out of it for the young people of my area in terms of skills in the horticultural and construction industries will be such that I will be able to address the 15 per cent unemployment in my area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I promised that I would do all I could for jobs. I have delivered to a large extent here. I hope that this meeting&mdash;which is one of many that I will hold; and I am holding another one on 11 November on tourism&mdash;will be the start of something big. We will reintroduce the forestry industry in my area; I do not want greenies putting their lives in jeopardy or people who have capital in the bush having it destroyed by other people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was the case in the adjournment debate last night, I again would like to bring to the attention of the House the plight of some of our primary producers on the mid-north coast of New South Wales as a result of the current devastating drought. Again, I have been asked to bring this matter to the attention of the parliament. I received a letter from a Mr Ray Burnett of Byabarra, which is just west of Wauchope. He writes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mark,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present drought aid to coastal farmers has not received the respect from our politicians that it warrants. The Hastings Valley for example has an average rainfall of 1300 MM. The plants that grow in the area are therefore adapted to this environment. Also the soils are much shallower in depth to the soils of the inland and because of the heavier average rainfall leaching the nutrients, they have less food value for stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that a drought of 2 months on the coast is equal to 6 to 9 months in the inland as regards food for cattle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This coastal area is the breeding cradle for cattle to supply feed lots and inland grass fatteners with young cattle for the domestic and overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you can have some conception of the present drought on this coastal area, the lowest rainfall ever recorded in the Hastings Valley, was in 1941 with 653 MM. or 50.2% of the average rainfall over 100 Years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This year to the end of September we have had 373 MM. or 28.7% of the years average. (we require 280 MM. by the end of December to equal the lowest recorded).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This follows 3 years of below average rainfall:-</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1993<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">705 MM. or 54.2%</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I purchased grain and fed some stock to sell at the store sale at Wauchope on Friday 14-10-94 it cost $533 for the grain and the 7 cows and 1 calf brought $730 less $80 costs making a return of $117 for the value of the animals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since I purchased the grain prices have now risen from $222 to $350 per ton.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fodder transport subsidy is also of marginal benefit because to reach the $500s to make a claim valued at $250 a farmer will have to spend $3,500 on feed to gain the $250.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This subsidy I consider a great Joke, because if the trucks were not delivering the fodder they would not be using fuel, tyres or oil which the Federal and State Governments are collecting taxes for. The taxes collected for this additional truck usage is therefore compensating the Government for the transport subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Stock water on farms will possibly last 2 months, depending on how hot it becomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The local Kempsey Rural Lands Board Veterinarian spoke on the ABC Radio last week, he stated that without substantial rain there could be a loss of 80,000 head of cattle in the boards area within 6 weeks because of the lack of stock drinking water on farms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some properties are already carting water for stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the low market value of stock at present and the continuous low income from previous years farmers will be unable to purchase re-stockers when normal conditions return. This could have a devastating effect on the future supplies of store cattle from this cattle breeding cradle of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ray Burnett.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Member of the N.S.W. Farmers Association.</PARA>
<PARA>I read this letter into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tonight to again highlight to the parliament that the measures the government has introduced, although very welcome and extensive in those areas of western New South Wales and Queensland that are experiencing severe drought and exceptional circumstances, are still not reaching and assisting a lot of primary producers in my part of Australia, which is the mid-north coast of New South Wales. People there are in just as devastating a situation because of the low rainfall and drought. As was the case with Mr Gray, whom I spoke of in the adjournment debate last night, they are not able to be certified by RAS to get assistance from the Department of Social Security. I am going to be making representations this week on behalf of Mr Burnett to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to see what he suggests we can do to try and salvage some of these people who are the backbone of the beef cattle producing districts in the mid-north coast of New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends various acts relating to the meat and livestock industry. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 to help identify the types of restrictions imposed by importing countries which enable the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation to establish export quota mechanisms. The bill also amends the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to provide for the selling agent to be responsible for collecting and forwarding levies imposed under the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990 whenever that agent is involved in a leviable transaction, and amends the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 to introduce a conversion factor allowing the beef production levy to be calculated where a hot carcase weight is unavailable and only cold carcase weight is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act provides the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, AMLC, with the powers to establish quota schemes on the export of meat and live sheep from Australia where restrictions are imposed, or likely to be imposed, on Australian exports by importing countries or by the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity for these amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 has arisen from the successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a result of which is that many quantitative restriction measures are being converted into tariff quota. The United States's action of introducing a tariff quota mechanism to replace the former quantitative mechanism under the US meat import law is one such example of this. The imposition of such economic restrictions not only disrupts our trade to the United States, which is a major market for beef worth in excess of $1.1 billion, but also creates uncertainty and impacts on the stability of Australia's domestic and other meat exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meat and livestock industry would like to see a degree of orderly marketing by maintaining parallel flows of tariff free products and tariff liable products in those years where exports are likely to exceed the tariff free limit. If left unmanaged there is a likelihood of a rush of product into the US market early in the year which would have the effect of depressing prices for the tariff free component while also disadvantaging northern Australian beef producers. It is envisaged that quota mechanisms set up under these arrangements will manage the trade in a way which avoids these effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A delegations clause is also proposed for the Australian Meat and Live-stock (Quotas) Act 1990 to enable the corporation's staff to sign the documents imposing a quota scheme. This will bring it into line with other corporation powers, which can already be delegated to the corporation's staff and its committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Beef Production Levy Act 1990 imposes a levy on the slaughter of cattle on a cents per kilogram basis of the hot carcase weight. The hot carcase weight is the weight of a carcase that is weighed within two hours of slaughter. At present the act provides that if a hot carcase weight is not available the carcase weight is deemed to be 240 kilograms per head of cattle for levy calculation purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was brought to the attention of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council that some small domestic abattoirs are not able to determine the hot carcase weight, but are able to determine a cold carcase weight. Representations from these abattoirs indicated that the great majority of the carcases produced by them are under 240 kilograms, and these abattoirs were therefore paying higher levies than they should reasonably have paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To address this problem, the government has accepted the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council's recommendations that a conversion factor be incorporated into the act to allow a conversion from cold carcase weight to a hot carcase weight equivalent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 currently provides that where an abattoir slaughters cattle on which a cattle transaction levy is imposed, the abattoir proprietor is responsible for collecting the levy and forwarding it to the Commonwealth. In other cases, an agent, if involved in the sale of cattle, is responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has caused some problems where an agent is involved in the sale of cattle to an abattoir proprietor or facilitates the sale of cattle on an `over-the-hooks' basis. The proposed amendment clarifies that the agent rather than the abattoir proprietor will be responsible for collecting and forwarding to the Commonwealth the levy imposed by the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990. The abattoir proprietor will only become responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy where an agent is not involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Penalties have been imposed in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 for offences relating to amendments in the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 when either the hot carcase weight or the cold carcase weight is available but not used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment also corrects an omission in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 regarding abattoir proprietors' ability to refuse to slaughter livestock. This provision permits abattoir proprietors to refuse to slaughter livestock owned by another person unless funds for the payment of the livestock slaughter levy are first made available. The correction brings pigs within the scope of this provision, so that if pigs are to be slaughtered funds for the payment of the pig levy are first to be made available. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef production levy is collected for research and development purposes, promotional efforts, disease eradication programs and the residue survey. It is currently calculated on a hot weight basis. The difficulty arises when the carcase is weighed cold as this always produces a lighter weight. This legislation introduces a conversion factor of 1.03 which allows for a weight reduction of three per cent for the chilled or frozen meat, and provides the hot carcase weight equivalent for levy calculation purposes. Where, for whatever reason, neither the hot nor cold weight is determined, a deemed carcase weight of 240 kilograms will be assumed in order to calculate the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also clarifies a point of some confusion by stating that an agent, if involved in the sale of cattle, is responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy to the Commonwealth. The abattoir proprietor will only become responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy if an agent is not involved. It is good to see that that point is being clarified in this legislation because I know in my own electorate of Maranoa, which is three times the size of the state of Victoria, with very important beef producing and beef added value industries in the form of feedlots, it does cause confusion and some conflict between the producer and the agent or the abattoir. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abattoir proprietors are also given the ability to refuse to slaughter livestock&mdash;including pigs&mdash;which are owned by someone else, unless levy payments are first made. Quite clearly, the abattoir proprietor will have some capacity to get those levies paid prior to the slaughter of those animals. This has also been an area of conflict in many parts of my own electorate where there are some producers who feel that this is a levy that they should not pay and someone else should pay. This legislation clears up that point and gives abattoir proprietors an opportunity, if they feel there is a problem collecting these levies, to get that levy prior to the slaughter of livestock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is timely, given the presence of legislation meeting Australia's GATT obligations before the House of Representatives, to recognise the enormous commitment within the beef industry to its future and, indeed, its growth and expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that the beef industry's commitment to research and development, self-promotion and disease eradication has been crucial to the beef industry's continuing success on the Australian domestic market, and the export markets. It is an industry which has gained a great deal of recognition and market share in the emerging Asian basin. These markets will be crucial to the beef industry in Australia in the future. It is vital that this legislation plays its part in allowing the industry to sort out the way it collects its levies and on what basis it collects those levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meat processing is one of Australia's largest rural based industries. It employs more than 30,000 Australians and generates in the order of $5.6 billion in turnover annually. That turnover is nearly all generated out in regional Australia. It is a great employer of the regional work force and plays a great part in the decentralisation of this nation. Obviously, with $5.6 billion turning over in regional Australia, it has clear implications for the wider community because of the multiplier effect that those dollars generate in those communities where meat processing and the beef industry are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 75,000 farms and pastoral properties produce livestock for slaughter. Beef and veal combined are Australia's fourth largest export earner, generating $2,949 million annually. They only rank behind coal, gold and wool in terms of total export earnings. It is a very significant industry and one that we need to ensure plays its part in any recovery and any future of this nation. I am quite convinced that we will always have a beef industry in Australia. However, there are aspects of the cost of production on which we must start to focus as a nation, if we want the beef industry to be part of a viable export sector in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that end, the GATT outcome provides new opportunities for the Australian beef industry to build on. In particular, the opportunities to expand further into the American market are noteworthy. The US Meat Import Law, which has thwarted Australian beef exporters for many years, will be converted to a tariff only protection. There will also be increased access through tariff quotas. Initially there will be an increase of 17 per cent in access in 1995, compared with 1994. That is a significant increase in terms of access on a year-on basis. The new global quota for access to the US beef market will be 656,621 tonnes of beef of which Australia will have a 57.6 per cent market share, that is, 378,214 tonnes of beef. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has similarly agreed to a reduction in tariffs, subject to particular quantity based safeguards. The Korean market is another which shows great promise. Korea has agreed to completely liberalise its beef market at the end of the year 2001. Of course, with the end of 1994 almost upon us, that date is only seven years away. Of course, when it has liberate its beef market in 2001, only a tariff will apply. The Koreans will also be increasing their global quota allowing for a greater proportion of sales to be made direct with end users, reducing the above quota tariff and reducing the government levied mark-up on imports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, those sorts of arrangements, as they phase out in the year 2001, will have a massive impact on the beef industry on a global basis. For Australia to become part, and to gain part, of that increased access to Korea, we are going to have to compete with other countries which will be seeking a share of that market. Other breakthroughs are likely in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Canada and Mexico, and there are clearly enormous opportunities for our beef industry around those markets in the future, as those economies grow and those peoples demand a higher standard of food intake and a better quality of food intake, which is related to their increased standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the $900 million of gains predicted for Australian agricultural industries as a result of GATT, $330 million is expect to flow through to the beef industry. In other words, more than a third of the gains in terms of the GATT outcomes are going to flow through to the Australian beef industries. These gains, of course, will be delivered over a number of years. Those outcomes are yet to be achieved, and they will not all come in the first years of the operation of the new GATT rules. The gains that are available to our primary industries must, however, be kept firmly in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we can expect to gain $900 million a year as a result of many years of multilateral negotiations, significant gains could also flow from the reform of the Australian taxation system. Agricultural industries currently pay around $1.3 billion a year in indirect taxes such as fuel tax, sales tax and payroll tax: indirect taxes that producers in the agricultural industries are paying on an annual basis. It is clear that genuine reform in this area would produce gains of the same dimension as GATT would, if not of a bigger dimension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tax reform of this nature would also vastly enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products. We can no longer expect a free ride in the international trade arena on the basis of our historical role as a major exporter. International trade is now a much tougher environment. Whilst our products will always be able to compete on quality, taste and freshness, we must also be able to offer competitive prices. That requires a genuine commitment to reducing the costs of production in this country, and tax reform is the ideal place to start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also consider the urgent need to reform our expensive and inefficient transport system. The road transport industry does its best, considering that it too faces a prohibitive fuel tax and sales tax regime and a substandard road network. Many truck drivers talk to me about the fact that they do not mind paying their fuel tax but that they would like to see more of that money going back into their roads. They believe that they have to contribute to the roads, and they are quite happy to do that by paying the 30-odd cents per litre fuel tax. But they want to see that money going back into roads and not the great crime of it being siphoned off into other programs that the government may use some of that money for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to an area in the back of my electorate&mdash;the Diamantina Shire. Only 250 people live in the Diamantina Shire. It is based around the townships of Birdsville and Bedourie. There are 1,600 kilometres of roads in the Diamantina Shire, but only six kilometres of those roads are sealed. That gives some example to the House of how the people out there are paying their fuel taxes, but are not getting any of the money back in the form of better roads in their part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often people there tell me that it is not what damage the trucks do to the roads out there, it is what damage the roads do to their trucks. As I said earlier, they would be quite happy to pay their fuel taxes and sales taxes providing the money went back into building better roads. Of course, better roads will reduce the cost of production and, ultimately, make our exports more competitive on the international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, commented on the looming grain shortage crisis caused by the drought. He urged grain feed consumers, lot feeders, pork producers and chicken meat operators to import grain from North America because it would be cheaper than shipping it from Western Australia, despite the fact that ample feed supplies are available there. On the figures that I have received, it would cost approximately $40 a tonne to ship grain halfway around our domestic coastline, and it would cost $27 a tonne to bring it across the Pacific. That is a ludicrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation, we can no longer afford to have a situation where it is more expensive to bring grain halfway around our domestic coastline than it is to bring it 12,000 kilometres across the Pacific. At the end of the day, if those producers source the grain in Western Australia it means they will be paying a freight penalty which will add to their costs. Reforms are required on the waterfront to ensure genuine competition in terms of the cost of moving grain and products on our coastal shipping routes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our railways perform only marginally better. The most efficient rail freight operation in Australia can move grain for 5.5 cents per net tonne per kilometre. The best performance in American rail is 1.54 cents per net tonne per kilometre. In other words, Australia is 3.5 times worse off than America in terms of moving grain. It is little wonder that our struggling farmers are doing it so hard. The harsh reality for them is that, to compete internationally, they have to be competitive in terms of price and quality, and that means absorbing enormous cost disparities such as those to which I have just been referring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beef industry is one of our most price competitive industries. This is largely due to the size and climate of Australia which allows us to produce vast quantities of livestock relatively cheaply, but we begin to fall behind the rest of the world when processing costs are taken into consideration. A 1993 study comparing the costs of best-in-class meat processing facilities in Australia, revealed that Australian facilities are far more costly than United States facilities and, to a lesser extent, those facilities in Argentina, Ireland and New Zealand. Given that labour costs are the most significant component of processing costs, that is obviously the area in which gains must be sought. This need was acknowledged by the Industry Commission in its report into meat processing. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labour is by far the largest single input cost of processing livestock into meat. Features of the industry's award system inhibit innovation and have contributed to industrial unrest. Seniority systems and daily hire provide insufficient incentives for training and skills development. The complexity of the tally system, and its structure of premium rates of remuneration for extra output, reduces incentives for improving working conditions and productivity . . . The Commission has . . . recommended that Labour market reform be pursued as a matter of priority.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that this warning has gone unheeded by the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union. Only two weeks ago Australia's largest beef processor, Australia Meat Holdings, withdrew from saleyard purchasing in Queensland and New South Wales for 24 hours following threats from the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union that it would commence a rolling one day per week stoppage&mdash;great timing in the middle of the worst drought since European settlement in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company clearly anticipated difficulties if it continued to buy cattle and could not slaughter as a result of the threatened work stoppages. This had a major impact on the cattle sales in my own electorate, particularly the Dalgety sales in Toowoomba, Churchill, the Dalby saleyards and Casino in New South Wales. All those selling centres were particularly devastated by the withdrawal of AMH from those sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, who paid the ultimate penalty on that day and for the following week? It was those drought affected producers who had no alternative but to sell their stock. The alternative was to take them home and keep them on a drought affected property for another week, and perhaps the following week there might have been sales where the AMH buyers would be operating. We have to remember that AMH is the largest meat processor in this country and therefore a very dominant factor at any auction sale around the eastern states and obviously in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this strike is that the AMIEU demanded a 14 per cent wage rise. The raise was not linked to either enterprise agreements or workplace restructuring; the union just wanted a pay rise. I guess everyone really would like a pay rise, with Christmas coming on. But it has to be linked, as the Industry Commission says, to productivity gains, to restructuring of work practices, to ensure that there is a sustainable industry there in the future. That is not the approach of the AMIEU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps someone from the other side of the House should explain why the AMIEU has taken this action. Clearly, what the AMIEU has to look at is that labour market reform does not translate to wholesale wage increases for everyone. That is something that must be explained to those members and those people who drive the AMIEU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it does mean is a cooperative drive for productivity improvements and the consequential rewards for employers and employees, which this can bring. If there is that cooperation, the rewards flow through, as the Industry Commission report clearly identifies, to better work practices, more sustainable employment opportunities and, of course, an ongoing job, which is important. Without this cooperation, the meat industry is going to be confronted with a situation where operating on the export market will become increasingly difficult because of the cost price imposed through those sorts of practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must understand in this country is that we are part of a global market&mdash;a global shopping village. The AMIEU ought to understand that it is part of that global shopping village, and that the products that it is involved in producing and processing are going to go, in most instances, onto our export markets and into these developing Asian markets. Of course, importers are also in a global shopping village, just like we are in Australia. Those importers wanting to consider the purchase of Australian products will also consider other countries' products. If they can buy them at a better price from other countries, they will buy them from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got to understand that, as part of the global shopping village that we live in today, we have all got to be part of the reforms and part of a cooperative approach.

If it can be done in one place, it can be done in others. There are two sides to every argument, and I would suggest that management has as much to answer for as any trade union does, in this industry and in any industry. </PARA>

Because they are acceptable, it is most likely that they are going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we look at these levies historically. The proposed amendments to the Beef Levy Act 1990 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Act 1991 were put on hold by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), pending the completion of a review of the cattle industry levy system recommended by the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council. It is significant that the review was carried out by the Cattle Council of Australia and the AMLIPC. The review has now been completed, with the outcome being that the Cattle Council of Australia has decided to retain the current system. The Cattle Council's position has been fully endorsed by the AMLIPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattle Council of Australia undertook a comprehensive review of the cattle industry levy mechanism, including a detailed examination of several alternative mechanisms, aided throughout by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy through the provision of technical advice and through the preparation of a paper comparing the main options in terms of equity, economic efficiency, administrative efficiency, visibility, and reliability and predicability of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cattle Council of Australia decided at its November 1993 meeting to support the continuation of the flat rate transaction levy and beef production levy beyond the completion of the trial period. The reductions in the transaction levy from $6.25 to $4 and to $3.60 from 1 July 1994 have taken much of the heat out of the argument. No-one likes to pay a levy and part of the problem has been that all parts of the industry felt that they were the ones making the major contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a cattle producer myself, I do not like a levy. I have spoken to the minister recently about a levy that is currently being paid on forced sales of drought affected cattle&mdash;cattle which would not normally be going to slaughter and for which the levy will not contribute to a better price. I have put forward my point of view that, where it can be shown that breeding cattle are being sold unnecessarily because of the weather circumstances, perhaps there should be a suspension of the levy. The cattle council's conclusion was consistent with the analysis by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy of the options, which showed that the current arrangements are the best compromise to achieve the industries goals of visibility, efficiency and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having visited Japan, Korea and Taiwan during our winter recess, I was very pleased to note the way that funding through the levy system is being used by the AMLC to promote Australian beef&mdash;Aussie beef&mdash;in those countries. If we take the case of Japan in particular, we find that Australian beef last year was worth more than $1 1/2 billion to this nation. It has now surpassed iron ore in importance as a commodity exported to Japan. That success is not only due to the fact that trade barriers in Japan have been broken down; it is also due to the fact that the AMLC has mounted an aggressive and successful campaign for selling our beef. That is the levy in practice. All sectors of the industry are reaping benefits from this levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak to agents from time to time and they complain about the cost to them of collecting the levy, but they do have the advantage of using the funds, of reducing their OD or of simply having the money invested and accumulating interest for the month, because they return the interest monthly only. As a service to their customers it is better that they do it; it is better in the interest of the AMLC that it is returned on a regular basis. It would be a quite horrific exercise if we relied on, say, the growers to fill in that return. As a grower I know how lax growers can be in putting in their returns on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also pleased to see the honourable member for Maranoa indicate the contribution that the cattle industry, the meat industry, makes to rural Australia. It is a significant contributor as an employer&mdash;through meat processing, through cartage, through contracting&mdash;and also through the farming community. It is an industry that we in Australia take a great deal of pride in as the industry is a world leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unfortunate thing is that the current drought being experienced is going to require more than a levy to make sure that the industry stays on track. I feel that we will be suffering the consequences of this drought for the next decade because of the loss of breeding stock. Certainly in the immediate future we will not be able to satisfy contracts and there will be sectors in our meat industry where contracts will be lost to other exporters.

I was pleased to hear his comments about the AMLC and its role in the Japanese market.

That is something about which we are all pleased. It is also true to say that one of the problems that the beef industry faces is, as alluded to by the honourable member for Paterson and expanded on by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), its cost of production, particularly off-farm costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation we are currently considering could be considered as part of a processing reform because what the legislation does is make nothing more than an allowance for a conversion factor so that the levy calculation can be made on cold carcases as well as hot carcases. The legislation, as I understand it, provides for a three per cent reduction in the levy calculation where in fact the calculation is being made on the weight of a cold carcase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the honourable member for Maranoa and the honourable member for Paterson have indicated the importance of the meat processing industry, not only for the opportunity that Australia has to get into the export market in Japan with what is reputable product but also for the employment impact that this processing industry has in regional Australia. I would expand on the comments made by the honourable member for Paterson by pointing out that 27,000 people are employed in meat processing in regional Australia and the employment expenditure alone on meat processing generates something like $752 million for what are principally regional economies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Paterson is commenting on the whole question of meat processing. He recognises, as the opposition does, the value of this legislation. As he said, while levies are never welcome, at least this legislation does propose a more equitable way in which a levy calculation can be made. The member for Paterson quite fairly said that, while it is easy to be critical of meat processing plants, management has much to answer for. I want to reassure him that he will not find the opposition disagreeing with that. I do not come from the meat processing industry but I have spent some time in meat processing plants. What historically happened in meat processing that has posed such a problem for the Australian industry is that a them-and-us mentality became the norm. In that sense, there were faults on both sides. There is no doubt that the opportunity for enterprise bargaining and for greater cooperation between process workers and management is helping in some ways to break that down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need only look at the experience that enterprise bargaining has brought to an unrelated industry&mdash;the mining industry in the Pilbara of Western Australia&mdash;to see what it can do. There we can see what sort of attitudinal change it can bring about and how much: not only productivity is enhanced, but the whole self-esteem both of employers and employees is enhanced when the them-and-us strategy is broken down. There is an attitudinal change and some real sense of cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stand in this Main Committee as a South Australian. While we are in debate now, a major meatworks in South Australia is going through this whole exercise as to whether or not it can survive in the light of the present processing costs for meat anywhere in Australia. The works I refer to are the Tatiara meatworks. It has been very much in the news in South Australian papers because it has been forced to close. Currently the Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Dale Baker, in whose electorate I would suspect the Tatiara meatworks is located, is involved in negotiations to ensure that the Tatiara meatworks can remain there. These negotiations will very much depend on whether or not the employees at Tatiara are prepared to go through this sort of attitudinal change that enterprise bargaining can bring and are prepared to raise their productivity in order to lower the cost of production in the Tatiara meatworks. Frankly, the things that are keeping the Tatiara meatworks from being efficient and are forcing it to the wall, with real implications for the people of the country town of Bordertown, are the cost of production, the lack of throughput and the need for the sort of attitudinal change that has been referred to in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy for much of Australia's primary industry is that while on farm efficiencies have already been wrought&mdash;sometimes at the expense of employment numbers&mdash;it has been so much harder to achieve efficiencies in the processing sector. The meat industry illustrates that clearly. In fact, it is a very sobering truth that in meat processing labour costs alone make up 45 per cent of the total cost of any meat processing plant. It is a no less sobering truth that when we compare our own meat processing costs with those of the Americans we find that we actually load the AMLC with an additional disadvantage of up to $50 a carcase, making it that much more difficult for it to get into the Japanese opportunities that the member for Paterson has referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often use this illustration: if we were to load the wool industry on farm with the sort of employment arrangements that we have off farm in meat processing, the wool industry would never have survived. One of the reasons the wool industry has managed to remain competitive is that years ago it effectively introduced enterprise bargaining into the shearing shed. One of the reasons my own industry, the citrus industry, has managed to remain on farm competitive is that years ago it effectively introduced enterprise bargaining into the citrus field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both shearing and fruit picking are done on a contract basis. In my experience, both employees and employers have been better off. Far from employees being obliged to work for less, there has been opportunity for them to work and earn more as their productivity is recognised. This is what enterprise bargaining brings. This is what enterprise bargaining can do for meat processing and this is one of the opportunities in meat processing that has largely been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the legislation before the House makes the levy section of meat processing more equitable, because it allows more flexibility in the way in which a carcase levy is charged and recognises the equity of separating hot and cold carcase levy charging. But the reforms that need to occur in meat processing are much broader than this. They are self-evident and have been documented in a number of inquiries. Frankly, what is needed in meat processing is not necessarily an attack on the workers, but a whole change of attitude, so that the opportunity is there for workers to be rewarded for what they do at rates that reflect a competitive rate with the rewards that are offered around the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Maranoa made a very valid point&mdash;which was also taken up by the member for Paterson&mdash;when he expressed his concern about the drought that has so much affected his electorate. The concern that we, as legislators, now have in regard to the beef industry is, principally, its capacity to be work productive and efficient in world terms in the processing sector. Secondly, we need to ensure that when this drought ends there is still a breeding stock in place, so that the opportunities that now exist for the beef industry around the world, as GATT has lowered tariff barriers, can be exploited in the best possible way by ensuring that we have the breeding stock to keep our processors happy and to keep the demand for our export product met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a real challenge. It is not part of this legislation. It is something that the government should address with an appropriate drought package, to provide opportunities for farmers to ensure that they keep their breeding stock in place, so that we still have an industry when the drought ends. As far as this legislation is concerned, it allows the processors to more equitably enter into levy charges and, in the spirit of that equity, the opposition is pleased to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill, and I will make just a few brief comments about the circumstances of primary industry. The issue of road and rail comes up regularly. I would like to put on record that there is one very important debate that this country has not had: that concerns the relationship between road and rail, seen as a transport mode collectively, and not seen as a road in isolation from a rail running alongside it. We have a whole range of policies which inhibit rail, and which unnecessarily load up our roads. Frankly, I am appalled that as a nation we have not put far greater effort into understanding the relationship between both. Rail says constantly that it has to pay for its own track. It is subject to the excise, even though it pays for its own track. There is no diesel fuel rebate available. That is just one small example of a relationship that, as a nation, we should understand far better if we are going to develop a truly competitive and effective national transport component.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation deals with levies, the weighing of carcases and fairly straightforward matters. But I was interested to note the references in a Parliamentary Library paper to the GATT round. The GATT round was a very important part of the whole discussion about opening up the market for beef. For me, as a new member in this place, it was an important history lesson concerning the seven GATT rounds, beginning in 1947, and this eighth round, known as the Uruguay Round. We see some great opportunities in front of us, but there are many impediments still to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that Japan will allow rice to be imported. The minimum access for imports will rise from four per cent of the average level of rice consumption, to eight per cent after six years. The interesting statistic that is of value to this discussion is that there will have to be reductions of 21 per cent on general volumes of subsidised exports, and reductions of 36 per cent on budget outlays on export subsidies from their 1986 to 1990 averages. That sums up some bottom line numbers concerning the opportunities for Australia as a competitive exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly on the future of agriculture. Constantly as I move through my electorate I hear great concern about the future of agriculture, and it is not just that mind-set that comes when people are on hard times. The drought does do things with people's minds and it does perhaps distract us from the more positive aspects of life, but there is an underlying concern about the future of agriculture, about the number of people that will be employed, the opportunities that will be there for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at a primary school about a month ago doing the sort of thing that members of parliament are expected to do, and it is a part of my work that I thoroughly enjoy. The deputy principal asked me about my family and I said, `Well, this one is doing that and this one is doing something else,' and so it went on. It turned out, of course, that none of them were on the farm and none were going back on the farm. She said to me, `You are a successful farmer&mdash;you have got your children off the land.' And there it was quite starkly in front of me. There is that feeling in regional Australia that there is no future for young people, and that is why we see such a push on Austudy and the assets test in education, because there is an overwhelming belief that we must get our young out of agriculture. That is something that I will not dwell on any longer but it is something that we must address as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk a little bit about the drought from a different angle. We have heard the statistics on the lack of production and the effect that we think it will have on our economy, but I want to touch on something that came to me this morning in talking to home, that brief contact with home. I said to my wife, `How is the morale at home?' and she said to me, `I think it is not anything that you would particularly notice just yet, but people are getting more niggly, they are getting that little bit more frustrated as the drought bites and they know that they have to wait another 18 months at least for an income.' So we must remember in this place the personal effects on families and on individuals as they struggle to come to terms with this devastation. It will wipe out many, their businesses and their futures, and they will have to start again. But for those who have the courage to go on perhaps we could just share with them the pressure that is on them currently as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to go on to the matter of employment in primary industry. This has been quite an issue over the last decade, unemployment and the opportunities for particularly regional Australia. I think it is accepted that the urban centres, the major cities of this country, have a greater range of opportunities but there are many of us who choose to live in the regions and who value what that life in the regions offers to us. I think that we need to see it in a much more holistic sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will try to sum it up this way. I was at a very good seminar that the Parliamentary Library put on last week and a senior Labor backbencher there related this anecdote. He had said to a major employer on talkback radio, `When did you ever support a wage rise for the workers?' Of course, the employer had to say, `Never', and that was seen by this senior Labor backbencher as a great coup, as a great win, that he had made his rhetorical point and he had scored a political point on the day. Of course, it is just as easy to ask when a union ever did not go for a wage rise or refused a wage rise. It is part of our ethic and part of our culture that we tend to lock ourselves into these situations and I think the nation has been a loser because of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> this morning something that the Reserve Bank bulletin of September said about the internationalisation of employment and of wages. I think that really is something that as a nation we might look at rather than just get into the cheap political point scoring. It is worth spending some time on it because this is really about the future of our primary industries and its contribution to our nation: the effect of the internationalisation; the employment opportunities and wages; and the coexistence with primary industry. This statement from the Reserve Bank bulletin sums it up for us, gives us much food for thought and is something we really should attack as vigorously as we can as a parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If trade reform does indeed lead to a more efficient and dynamic economy, real wages and employment opportunities will increase. The concern is that the dispersion of wages will also increase. As tariffs continue to fall, and imports from low-wage countries rise, there may be downward pressure on the employment and the relative wage of workers with few skills. To date, however, the loss of low-skilled jobs in Australia as the result of trade reform appears to be relatively modest. It is only in the clothing and footwear industry that cheaper input prices, associated with lower tariffs, have caused significant job losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An alternative, but related view is that changes in technology, rather than direct effects of trade, are driving developments in the labour market. The suggestion is that there is some world-wide technological change that is reducing the demand for unskilled labour. This technological change is mainly driven by general scientific advance. In the United States it is leading to lower wages for unskilled workers. In Australia, and in other countries with relatively inflexible relative wages, it is raising the possibility of chronic unemployment of unskilled workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I acknowledge that the government is trying to address this with its case management and with its Working Nation document, but we still have, by international standards, a very rigid job market. The statement also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both increasing wage dispersion and high unemployment are leading to pressure in many countries to limit or reverse trade liberalisation. These pressures seem generally inappropriate, and particularly so, if the real force is technological change. A more appropriate response is to ask what type of policies might be used to limit, and to deal with, increasing inequality and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One response is to give up on the notion that the wages system is an appropriate tool to achieve income distribution goals. Perhaps an economy adjusts more easily to various types of shocks if relative wages are free to move. In the end, a more flexible labour market may deliver lower unemployment and a more dynamic economy. If this is the case, the tax and transfer system is probably the appropriate policy tool to achieve distributional goals. The difficult issue is how to do this. If the market-clearing wage for unskilled workers falls too close to the level of unemployment benefits, is the incentive to work affected?</PARA>
<PARA>The great criticism of my side of politics is that we do not care enough about the low income people and do not place enough store in supporting social security. I feel that I can bring some credibility to this debate because as a farmer for many years I have really not made much more than social welfare wages. So it is presumptuous to think that my side of politics is always the silvertails. The statement from the Reserve Bank bulletin continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If highly-skilled labour that is internationally mobile is taxed heavily, the incentive to require skills may be reduced and the high taxes may lead to a `brain-drain'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is already occurring. I know from my work with the long term strategies committee that the people who measure these things within our immigration department were very surprised at last year's statistics, and there is already a brain drain out of Australia. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understanding these interactions between the tax and transfer system and people's incentives is critical to developing successful policies concerning income distribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second response is to upgrade the skills of relatively unskilled workers through increased training.</PARA>
<PARA>But here again, training for what? The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By reducing the relative supply of unskilled workers, it may be possible to increase their relative wage.</PARA>
<PARA>We understand that. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This idea is attractive. If the training is of the right type, the new growth theory suggests that it might also increase the economy's rate of growth. The fact that training holds the promise of increased growth and less dispersion of income has seen many governments embrace the idea in recent years. The real problem is what type of training is required. Should it be vocational or general? Should training be conducted by government or in the private sector? How should training be paid for? These are questions with no simple answers. However, the twin processes of technological change and internationalisation significantly increase the returns to finding the right answers.</PARA>
<PARA>I come back to my comments about GATT and about the opportunities for Australia and for the primary industry sector to provide, firstly, I suppose, a survival mode; and then to go on and provide employment opportunities for the whole nation. We are going to have to do quite a lot better over the rest of this decade if we really are committed to the philosophy of full employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1993 proposed to remove an anomaly that exists in the treatment of crude oil production for crude oil excise purposes under the Excise Tariff Act 1921. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Duties of excise are payable under the Excise Tariff Act 1921 on crude petroleum oil produced in Australia. As a result of the operation of other Commonwealth legislation, such as the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987, excise is in effect only payable on crude petroleum oil produced from the North West Shelf project area and in most onshore production areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, the government introduced changes to the petroleum taxation arrangements to encourage petroleum exploration and development in Australia. A key factor in these changes was the exemption of the first 4,767.3 megalitres of crude petroleum oil produced from onshore fields and offshore projects from the payment of excise. This exempt crude oil is defined as `exempt onshore oil' and `exempt offshore oil'. The granting of the exemption in respect of exempt offshore oil is dependent upon whether the oil is produced from a `project'. As the term `project' is not defined and there is no other relevant statutory or industry definition, uncertainty exists as to the scope of the exemption from the payment of excise on crude oil produced from offshore projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To eliminate this uncertainty and to provide for the consistent treatment of exempt offshore oil and exempt onshore oil, it is proposed to change the basis for the granting of the exemption from the payment of excise on offshore oil while still fulfilling the intention of the original 1987 policy. The exemption is proposed to be granted in respect of crude oil produced from an offshore field, where `field' is a term that is readily understood in the petroleum industry. It is also proposed to insert provisions that will enable the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to make guidelines that are to be taken into account when prescribing a field for the purposes of granting this exemption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Excise Tariff Legislation Amendment Bill before the Committee, which will clarify the excise status of the Cossack and Wanaea petroleum fields on the North West Shelf. This legislation will remove any doubt that the Cossack and Wanaea fields are separate for the purpose of excise. As a result, the first 30 million barrels of oil from each field will be exempt from excise. Without this legislation the excise status of the fields is less clear, and it could possibly be argued that the excise exemption should apply to the first 30 million barrels from the combination of the fields rather than each singly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the government has always considered Cossack and Wanaea to be separate developments, even though they are close enough that the production will occur from the same platform. Woodside Petroleum, the operator of the project, requested that legislation be amended to clarify its position beyond doubt. Although this clarification may seem unnecessary to the casual observer, there are sound reasons in this case for making the letter of the law reflect the spirit of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Sovereign risk' is a term commonly used in the resources debate in Australia now, where, a few years ago, the term was confined to academic textbooks. I would venture that it is one of the greatest problems facing the resource sector today in its dealings with the Labor government. Sovereign risk is simply defined as the risk that governments would change the operating rules after the commencement of a project. Security of investment is a critical issue for resources projects as they are typified by high capital costs, long lead times between discovery and production, and finely judged financial margins. Thus, once the decision to invest has been made, resources projects are sensitive to changes and factors such as taxation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of such changes can continue to cause uncertainty for many years, as in the Labor government's decision in 1990 to impose a resource rent tax on oil and gas recovered from Bass Strait. Four years later, the financial consequences of this decision are still subject to action in the courts, and there is still the possibility of considerable increases in the price of gas to Victorians as a result of this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The entrenchment of sovereign risk as a disturbing new factor in Australia's resources debate occurred in 1991 with the Labor government's decision to reserve Coronation Hill from mining without allowing negotiations to proceed between the prospective miners and the traditional owners of the land. Although Australia lost the opportunity of 630 new jobs and at least $500 million in export income as a result, the event took on a much wider significance and was widely seen as a turning point for domestic and international investors considering resource projects in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision confirmed the growing suspicion that this Labor government could not take the tough decisions on multiple land use and was not committed to the sustainable development of our nation. Since then, the Native Title Act has further entrenched sovereign risk in the resources debate, particularly since the question of the status of pastoral leases with respect to native title remains inconclusive, even though the legislation purported to exempt pastoral leases from native title claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a development the size of the North West Shelf project, it is crucial that the operating rules for the project not be changed in the middle of the project without full consideration of the consequences. Even though the present legislation seems to involve only a routine clarification of excise status, there is a recent precedent, in addition to the resource rent tax on Bass Strait, which reinforces the eagerness of this government to indulge in sovereign risk in the petroleum sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990, in a very similar situation, the government introduced legislation with the opposite intention of the legislation now before the Committee. On that occasion, the government was seeking to clarify the excise status of two separate oil fields in a way very much to its own revenue advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geologically, the Tuna L field in Bass Strait was entirely discrete from the surrounding fields and yet the government claimed it should be considered identically to the adjacent field for excise purposes. Not only did the government claim that Tuna L was not a separate oil field; it also introduced into parliament legislation to retrospectively establish its claim. Since this same dispute between the government and the Bass Strait joint venturers was currently being heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the government's legislation at the time was a blatant abuse of its responsibility to govern fairly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was unashamedly trying to correct its past errors by retrospectively legislating away the existing rights of the Bass Strait partners, BHP and Esso. Not content with that, the government also used its legislative powers to interfere with the course of hearings then before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The AAT was the relevant body empowered to consider and determine this dispute, and it was a shabby move to legislate to prevent a decision adverse to the government from taking effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bass Strait joint venturers were entitled to fair treatment under the laws of the land, as is any corporate citizen, small or large. At the time the coalition sought an amendment to ensure the legislation was not retrospective. I would like to think that the arguments of the coalition at that time, during the debate, have persuaded the government not to attempt to override the rights of Woodside Petroleum in the current matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, I do not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) to make such a public concession but I can assure the Committee that, at the time of the imbroglio surrounding Bass Strait, we properly expressed the outrage of many Australians. It is pleasing to see the government now bring the legislation before the Committee. In any case, I want to welcome the government's more enlightened approach on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The North West Shelf project is too important to be meddled with by opportunistic interventions from governments. It is the largest natural resource development in Australia's history and is, surprisingly to most Australians, in the league of the Snowy Mountains scheme. However, unlike the Snowy, it has been undertaken entirely by the private sector. Honourable members should not be surprised to hear that the company operating the North West Shelf project, Woodside Petroleum, began life in my electorate of Gippsland and is, in fact, named after a town there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1954, Australia imported nearly all its crude oil, but the wildcatting spirit which has led directly to our present near self-sufficiency in oil was well under way. Thus it was that the float for Woodside was a tremendous success and, although many lean years followed, the astute backers of the company were able to continue to fund the vital search for oil. In 1959, Woodside went all out to gain 2,600 square kilometres of exploration acreage off the Ninety Mile Beach near Lakes Entrance in Gippsland. However, misfortune dogged the company as its unsuccessful permits were immediately adjacent to the enormous oil reserves later discovered in Bass Strait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1960s, Woodside was able to secure the entire North West Shelf area, thus establishing its present-day security. Faced with the prospect of exploring this vast region, Woodside took on partners. But the cost was still so huge that in 1967 the company relinquished all other exploration permits to concentrate on the North West Shelf. At this time, a non-commercial discovery was made in the region, but it was not until 1971 that a significant discovery of gas was made. The enormous gas and condensate reserves were then revealed. However, the Whitlam Labor government caused activity to cease on the North West Shelf by withdrawing essential tax incentives. But Woodside managed to keep its staff through this difficult period by contracting drilling work overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in 1975, with a coalition government returned in federal parliament and strong support from the Western Australian government, the joint venturers set about developing the gas reserves. It was clear from the start that the project would not be viable without exports. There was simply too much gas for the domestic market alone, and the costs of extraction and transport from this remote area were not justified by the small domestic demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, a 20-year contract to supply gas to the State Energy Commission of Western Australia was signed, and Woodside assumed responsibility for operating the North West Shelf project. The Western Australian contract required a $2.5 billion investment, including a 135-kilometre submarine pipeline which was completed in 1984. Expensive and challenging as this first phase was, the development of the export phase was an extraordinary achievement and has been tremendously successful. Focusing on the enormous Japanese market, Woodside signed a contract in 1985 to supply six million tonnes a year of liquefied natural gas for the next 20 years. With investment costs of around $5 billion, the export phase has surpassed expectations&mdash;so much so that in July the Japanese buyers contracted to purchase in the future seven million tonnes a year of LNG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since oil prices dropped soon after the 20-year agreement with Japan was signed, management of this project has required strict attention to costs. This focus on costs has been necessary throughout the project, owing to persistently low oil prices, and it is to the credit of Woodside that it has weathered this so well. With the first shipment of LNG in August 1989, the project was entering its mature production phase and earning much needed export revenue. It is worth noting that it took 14 years for the domestic gas to come on stream and 18 years for the export revenues to commence. That length of time is no reflection on Woodside's ability to develop this reserve; rather, it indicates the patience which investors in petroleum and gas must have before seeing a return. It also underscores the need for the operating rules not to be changed by governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seven million tonnes of LNG which should be exported each year from April 1995 will have a value of around $1.5 billion. The project now has the flexibility to meet the demand from its primary Japanese customers, as well as to sell on the spot market and to negotiate contracts with other countries, including Korea and Spain. Further flexibility was added with the discovery of the Cossack and Wanaea oil deposits in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To develop these deposits, the North West Shelf project will once again be using cutting edge technology to produce significant quantities of oil and gas from the two fields. Instead of the familiar oil platforms used in Bass Strait, production will occur from sub-sea wellheads through a flexible flow line to a converted oil carrier, known as a floating production storage and off-loading facility. Gas will be piped to the existing North Rankin A platform, 33 kilometres away. It is forecast that crude oil production of some 115,000 barrels a day will begin in 1995, providing a very welcome addition to Australia's oil requirements. There will also be production of liquefied petroleum gas starting late next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the North West Shelf is a significant driver in the Australian economy. The Clements and Grieg report of September 1993 on the economic impact of the North West Shelf project indicates that the production phase of the project is crucial to our economic wellbeing. The report concluded that in a typical year the project will increase Australian exports by 3.5 per cent, gross domestic product by 1.24 per cent, and national employment by 80,000 jobs. This is a staggering contribution for any one project to make to the health of our national economy. Total royalties to governments were estimated to be $240 million per annum in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This project has also given a substantial technological boost to Australian industry with the introduction of new technologies with significant local input. For instance, the construction of the Goodwin A platform is a significant milestone in Australia's gas and oil industry. Technically, the development of this platform involved considerable risk and made use of innovative technology not previously used in Australia. In the second phase of the project, which involves the export of LNG, Western Australian companies accounted for 66 per cent of the total value of contracts awarded, with an additional 7 per cent from the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the report emphasises that the economic impacts of resource projects extend far beyond the simple direct boosts to exports, output and employment. The North West Shelf project is a sophisticated undertaking which has had to be built and operated on a large scale in a harsh and remote environment. The resulting challenges for the design and supply of equipment required the transfer and integration of new technologies from overseas for Australian equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local firms have developed expertise applicable to the unique conditions applying to the project, and more rigorous performance standards for equipment performance and supply have been implemented in Australia as a result. New expertise and abilities have been introduced into the domestic market and are flowing through into wider Australian industry. These new capabilities are enhancing Australia's ability to compete internationally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In another sphere, the North West Shelf project has resulted in $33 million in infrastructure improvements in the Pilbara region, including roads, hospital facilities, power and water supplies, airport works and housing. Woodside has contributed another $10 million in community and social infrastructure, encompassing social, sporting and cultural facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This expenditure reflects a consistent feature of the Australian resources industry. Long before regional development became a trendy label, mining companies in remote areas were building roads and ports for their primary task of developing resources but also houses, hospitals and community centres for the benefit of their employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Woodside's commitment to the community is also shown through the visitors centre constructed at Karratha. Given that public access to the facilities on the Burrup Peninsula is not possible, Woodside has provided visitors with an opportunity to understand the project indirectly but comprehensively in the visitors centre. The visitors centre at Karratha overlooks the shore facilities and includes a theatrette showing a video on the project as well as having numerous displays and informative staff. The fact that some 20,000 people visit the centre each year shows that a significant educational resource provided by Woodside is being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a resource project the size of the North West Shelf, it is crucial that governments set in place an appropriate operating framework which provides mutual benefits to the company, government and community. In this regard, it is pleasing to see the Western Australian government reforming the gas market, including removing the state government as a `middleman' between the producer and gas consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often governments cling ruthlessly to their right to extract large sums of money for a very small service, as the Queensland Labor government does in charging exorbitant coal freights. The freight charges are way out of proportion to the simple rail transport service rendered and are actually so large that they figure in the Commonwealth Grants Commission's deliberations on funding allocations between states. But from 1 January 1995, the State Energy Commission of Western Australia will cut itself out of the supply line, allowing the North West Shelf to sell directly to major industrial customers and compete for new market opportunities, particularly in the Pilbara. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant reform is the removal of SECWA's monopoly on the Dampier to Bunbury gas pipeline. Importantly, Woodside recently publicly expressed confidence that the spirit in which the negotiations of these new arrangements were carried out would achieve the objectives of all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear example for the Commonwealth government in the manner these reforms have been carried out. Not only have the reforms been swift and decisive but they have been built on genuine trust with the industry, and this must be the keystone of such reform processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Labor government could also take a major step forward in building trust with industry by abolishing export controls on commodities such as LNG from the North West Shelf. Though it is not often publicised, many commodities are subject to export approval by the Commonwealth government. In theory, this allows the Labor government to control the price that Australian commodity producers receive for their exports. However, in practice, export controls have long outlived their usefulness and are largely ineffectual and difficult to enforce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must respond to the realities of the international marketplace or be left behind. The government must acknowledge that Australian companies selling in these markets have appropriate bargaining power with customers. Thus there is no justification for the government to be able to veto exports on the basis that a fair price has not been received. Even though these powers are rarely used, the existence of even residual powers causes increased uncertainty in decision making and may inhibit the development of the spot market for LNG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the government's independent advisory body, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics&mdash;ABARE&mdash;looked at export controls in the coal industry. The report argued `the costs of export controls appear to outweigh any possible benefits'. It is apparent this conclusion applies equally to the export of LNG from the North West Shelf as it does to coal. The assumption that governments understand the operation of markets better than the companies that have to survive and prosper in those markets is outdated and frankly ludicrous. By abolishing export controls, the government would show it has faith in the ability of Australian industry to compete in the international marketplace. With no financial cost to the government, this action would be of material benefit to industry in removing any impediment to free negotiation with buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I must emphasise the enormous benefits that accrue to Australia from the North West Shelf project. It is also crucially important that the government sends the correct signals of support to the operators and investors. As a consequence, the coalition supports the legislation before the Committee to clarify the excise status of the Cossack and Wanaea petroleum fields. </PARA>

I also wish to join issue with the government in respect of one aspect of the bill which goes to the question of legal professional privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say, on that matter, that there are three amendments encapsulated in this one issue of bona fide contest or discussion between the parties. Whilst I am advancing that amendment, I do not propose that we should employ the procedures to require a vote in the House of Representatives on that issue; I simply seek at this stage to see the issues more thoroughly exposed. When the issue is debated again in another place then that might be the appropriate time for there to be a more vigorous contest by way of vote in that place; but hopefully the issue, by being talked out, can be resolved in a satisfactory way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Evidence Bill 1993 and the Evidence (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 have as their principal purpose the codifying of the laws of evidence as they relate to matters before federal courts, and are also intended as a model for similar enactments within the states. The legislation is therefore a restatement of the law of evidence for application in federal and ACT courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence law is largely a product of the decisions of the courts, otherwise known as common law, although each state and territory has an evidence act. Together with the pronouncements of the courts over time, these acts form the basis of the laws of evidence in Australia in the various jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of sections 79 and 80 of the Commonwealth Judiciary Act, the evidence laws applicable in a Federal Court depend upon the state in which the court is sitting. Generally, state laws apply, whether they be of a statutory kind or whether they have originated at common law. In some cases&mdash;though in more limited cases&mdash;the Commonwealth Evidence Act 1905 may apply. If a Federal Court proceeding is transferred for hearing in another state, the evidence laws applicable may be substantially different as a result of the fact that, as previously stated, under the current arrangements, the applicable evidence laws depend upon the place in which the matter is heard by the Federal Court. This bill will provide uniformity across federal court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, the history of this area is that in 1977 the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs proposed that a reference be given to the Australian Law Reform Commission on the question of laws of evidence. That reference was provided to the Australian Law Reform Commission by the then Senator Peter Durack, the federal Attorney-General&mdash;a very good Attorney-General, I might say&mdash;and in due course the Australian Law Reform Commission produced both an interim report and a final report. In the meantime, the New South Wales government provided a reference to the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, and in 1988 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission recommended the adoption of reforms to the laws of evidence as applicable in New South Wales so as to conform with the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission. So it was that we came to a situation where in 1991 we had a Commonwealth evidence bill and an evidence bill from New South Wales introduced into the parliament to seek comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say, as an aside, that this matter has been the subject of most extensive consultations between the interested parties. Such process obviously is welcome in achieving a sensible outcome and establishing a model for the others to follow. There is no doubt that the more work that is put into achieving a uniform arrangement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales the more will the argument be strengthened for the others to pick up the model being proposed. </PARA>

We are generally supportive of the initiative to introduce a codified system for the laws of evidence for the Commonwealth and thereby for federal courts and, furthermore, to establish a model designed for the laws of evidence. Also I noted that this effort by the Commonwealth to reform the laws of evidence had been undertaken in conjunction with the New South Wales Parliament, which has likewise introduced an evidence bill. By and large the two bills reflect similar provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come now to the one aspect of the bill on which agreement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales was not able to be reached. The coalition's view, very simply, is that the Commonwealth ought to adopt the New South Wales approach to the issue and the Commonwealth bill should be brought into line. For that reason, I foreshadow three amendments: one to clause 118, one to clause 119 and one to clause 120. In each case the amendment would be to omit the word `sole' and substitute the word `dominant'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will amplify this one aspect of discord between the reformers. The substance of the issue relates to the question of legal professional privilege. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in some circumstances evidence will not be accepted by courts, where that evidence pertains to the professional communications between a solicitor and his or her client. The test that is proposed in order to determine whether legal professional privilege attaches to a communication or document made or prepared for the purpose of legal advice or for the provision of legal advice is whether that purpose, that is, the obtaining or provision of legal advice, is the sole purpose or the dominant purpose of the communication or document. That is the nub of the issue&mdash;whether this test should be the sole purpose test or the dominant purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure you can appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if the sole purpose test is adopted in this Commonwealth legislation which is proposed by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) it is a more restrictive definition. A more generous definition for the benefit of the party seeking to claim the privilege would be the dominant purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales Government, and, therefore, its proposal as embodied in the New South Wales bill, is that the dominant purpose test should be adopted. This matter has been the subject of correspondence between the Attorney-General for New South Wales and the federal Minister for Justice. In a letter dated 16 September 1994, the Honourable John Hannaford, MLC, Attorney-General for New South Wales, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I have also given consideration to your comments in your letter of 26 August 1994 concerning client legal privilege. I remain of the view that the adoption of a "dominant purpose" test in clauses 118 and 119 of the Bill would be preferable to avoid the possibility, no matter how remote, of strict judicial interpretation of the existing "sole purpose" test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of the fact that the adoption of a "dominant purpose" test was a key recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission, I regard this approach as a matter of some importance.</PARA>
<PARA>He completes the letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although any divergence between the State and Commonwealth Bills would of course detract from the goal of uniformity, I am strongly of the view that a "dominant purpose" test would be more appropriate for New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA>From that, it can be discerned that a significant aspect of this is that the Australian Law Reform Commission itself proposed the dominant purpose test and yet this minister insists on a stricter test of the sole purpose. I would be keen to encourage the minister to amplify his views on this. As I understand, his reasoning is based on the argument that the sole purpose test is a more accurate definition of the law today. I presume he argues that the government is attempting to codify the existing law. If the existing law is the sole purpose test, that is what ought to determine the Commonwealth's policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has also been carefully considered in the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of June 1994 entitled `Evidence Bill 1993: Interim report'. I have not been closely associated with the matter but I have had the benefit of reading parts of that report and it seems that the Senate committee has done a thorough job on the issue and has taken expert advice on the matter. In particular, the Senate committee had the benefit of advice from Mr Justice Smith, who expressed his concerns about the sole purpose test. At the bottom of page 38, the Senate committee's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He suggested that this test could not be applied literally without destroying the client's privilege. For example, a solicitor's file comes into existence not solely for the purpose of giving legal advice and assistance; it is also used by the solicitor as a record of work done in part for the purpose of charging the client.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee's report continues in paragraph 1.138:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His Honour noted that the High Court decision in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterford v Commonwealth</EMPHASIS> (1987) 163 CLR 54 demonstrates that the sole purpose does not work. He endorsed the ALRC suggestion of a `dominant purpose' test. This view was supported before the Committee by the Law Society of NSW. It was also an alternative suggested by Sir Garfield Barwick in one of the minority judgments in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grant v Downs</EMPHASIS>, the case which laid down the `sole purpose' test.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee refers to a view of the minister in paragraph 1.140:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responding to this view, Mr Justice Smith noted that the High Court itself had had great difficulty with the sole purpose test&mdash;only two members had purported to express support for it and had, in his Honour's view, even then converted it to what he called `a Clayton's' sole purpose test. In His Honour's view, the most significant point demonstrated during the ALRC's extensive consultation was that `the sole purpose test was not workable. There was universal acceptance of the dominant purpose test as a test that struck appropriate balance'.</PARA>
<PARA>This reveals another point that is worth making, perhaps as an aside, and that is that we have another authoritative voice&mdash;in this case the Law Society of New South Wales&mdash;that has also examined this matter in great detail and come down in favour of the dominant purpose test in distinction to the sole purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the Senate committee did not resolve the matter but it certainly quoted at length the arguments in favour of the dominant purpose test. We have got the Australian Law Reform Commission lining up on that side; we have got the Law Society of New South Wales lining up on that side; we have got Mr Justice Smith lining up on that side. In fact, everybody seems to be lining up on that side except the minister. Given the nature of the opinions expressed, and given the fact that the purpose of this proposal is to provide a uniform law and</PARA>

In the second reading speech on the Evidence Bill the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) detailed the origins of the Evidence Bill from the original recommendation in November 1977 of the then Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when he referred to `a review of the whole of the evidence law . . . be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission.' The review would work through to the work of the Law Reform Commission and the development with New South Wales of the text for the new evidence bills. The result of that work is now before the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there have been further developments. The provisions of the Evidence Bill were referred earlier in the year to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In June the committee published an interim report in which the committee stated it was keen to see the bill passed, and made recommendations relating to some further work by the government on some of its provisions, its time of commencement and post-enactment monitoring. Further, the Minister for Justice has responded to the Senate committee, advising the committee of the government's intention to move the amendments to the Evidence Bill we are to consider in detail today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting another evidence reform of this government, the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 and the Foreign Evidence (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendment) Bill 1993 I said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[As] a non-lawyer . . . I think it is very important to make it clear that, from the community's perspective, the law as it is presently understood and practised in this country is seen to be in the province of the very rich and the very powerful, in the hands of and available to large corporations and, to a very limited extent, the poor and dispossessed through legal aid assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is still the case. These bills will make a significant contribution towards correcting the community's perception of the way the law is practised in Australia. This is very important because it is clearly a right in a democratic society that if we are to be ruled by the rule of law then people must be able to clearly and easily make use of the legal system to seek to attain their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will attempt to right this misperception in a number of ways. First, they will for the first time in this country's legal history make evidence law much more accessible to those who need to use it. Instead of being found as part of the common law in the decisions of the superior and appellate courts across Australia, much of the law of evidence that applies generally in all proceedings will, for those who appear before the federal courts and the courts of the Australian Capital Territory, be found in an act of the Commonwealth statute books. Having evidentiary rules in statutory rather than in case law form will make it much easier for litigants and practitioners not versed in the arcane mysteries of the law of evidence to find and apply the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bills will make a contribution towards lowering the cost of obtaining justice in the courts in which they also apply, which can only improve the community's perception of the practice of law in this country. The Evidence Bill in particular will lower the costs of justice: firstly, by providing rules where there is no uncertainty about the current law, for example, in the rules relating to hearsay evidence; and, secondly, by making the admissibility of evidence more predictable and hence litigation itself more predictable. Thirdly, the bills will make it much simpler to prove many facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this last point there are provisions throughout the bill that will reduce the time and cost of proving facts. Amongst its hearsay exceptions, the bill includes exceptions for: use of tags and labels attached to an object in the course of a business to prove the identity, nature, ownership, destination, origin or weight of the object and the contents, if any, of the object and, for statements about the identity of a sender or recipient, the time of transmission of a message transmitted by E-mail, fax, telegram, lettergram or telex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to documentary evidence. The bill abolishes the original document rule and in its place provides straightforward procedures for proof of the contents of a document, which will enable a party, as an alternative to tendering the original document, to prove its contents by tendering a readily available photocopy, microfilm copy or, in the case of computer records, a computer print-out of such records. In part 4.3, which is titled `Facilitation of proof', there are provisions that will remove the need for witnesses to attend court to give evidence of formal matters&mdash;for example, proof of signatures and proof of acts in official documents&mdash;or of the proper functioning of devices and processes used by businesses that have provided evidence. The same part also includes presumptions relating to the postage, transmission and delivery of postal articles and documents transmitted through telecommunications systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third way in which the bill will make a contribution towards correcting the community's perception of legal practice is by removing unnecessary restrictions on the admission of evidence in proceedings. Examples of such provisions are the exception for first-hand hearsay evidence in civil proceedings where it would cause undue expense or undue delay or where it would not be reasonably practicable to call a witness to give evidence, and the abolition of the exceptions to the opinion rule for matters of common knowledge and ultimate issues in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, there are many other issues in the bill, but I will not address them in my contribution this morning. However, I believe it is part of a major commitment by our government to significant legal reform in this country, going to the very heart of social justice matters. We are, as a government, doing great things on many fronts&mdash;and I include the cultural statement yesterday as a profound achievement of this government. But if we are not able to provide individuals and citizens in this country with their right to present their case and to believe and have confidence that the law will provide an effective arbitration of their circumstances and their rights as citizens, then we fail to achieve our social justice objectives. The Evidence Bill will effect considerable improvements to the way in which the federal courts and the courts of the Australian Capital Territory determine proceedings before them, and demonstrates the commitment of the government to real reforms of our legal system. </PARA>

A complementary New South Wales bill is a model for other states and is in terms substantially similar to those of the Commonwealth bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether to support the principle of the bill has, for me, been a real issue. There are undoubtedly unsatisfactory features of the present rules of evidence. Each state has for its rules a combination of common law and statute. Each state has an evidence act. For the most part, the evidence acts are outdated. They contain provisions in some cases designed to overcome what were even medieval common law principles which had survived for far too long. An example is the old rule that an accused cannot give evidence in his own defence&mdash;something that is outrageous by modern standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the federal level, the Judiciary Act provides for federal courts to apply the rules of evidence of the jurisdiction in which the court is sitting. That usually means that state rules of evidence will apply. There are, however, some federal statutes&mdash;the Commonwealth Evidence Act being one&mdash;which deal with some evidentiary issues which affect federal courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, it is relevant to ask whether the rules of evidence achieve the objective of having substantially the same result for the conclusion of litigation wherever it is heard in Australia. The answer in most cases is yes, but the answer in all cases is probably not yes. It is also relevant to ask whether any additional costs are imposed on the public generally because of the existence of different evidentiary rules in different jurisdictions. The answer is certainly yes, but how significant that is is very difficult to determine or even to comment on. The impact of the existence of different rules in different jurisdictions in an individual case in court is probably quite insignificant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some situations the present rules of evidence can cause confusion or they are unnecessarily complex or they draw unnecessary distinctions. An example, of which I have experience, is the overlapping statutory rules relating to the admissibility of business records. The provisions of the Commonwealth and state acts can apply together in some situations. The rules are quite important because they allow the admission of documents which constitute records of business transactions, which would otherwise be inadmissible because of the hearsay rule. The difference between the different models of business records legislation between the different jurisdictions is, in itself, unjustifiable and quite inconvenient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case for reform with a view to achieving some uniformities, in my opinion, is well made out and has been made out for quite some time. However, the question is whether this bill goes about achieving uniformity in the right manner. The Evidence Bill has the appearance of a code. It seeks to restate some basic laws of evidence and to effect, by restatement, reforms in some areas where reform is undoubtedly required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been significant debate both within the legal profession and among the judiciary as to whether it is appropriate to reform the law of evidence by a bill in this present form. One view, strongly held and voiced by some lawyers, is one for which I have considerable sympathy. That view is to the effect that large parts of the rules of evidence&mdash;particularly those governed by common law principles&mdash;are well known, well understood and applied on a daily basis without any difficulty in courts across the country. Those rules are in no need of reform and they are in no need of statutory restatement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, it is accepted by proponents of this view that other parts of the rules of evidence are in need of reform and that reform should be uniform. In support of that, the argument goes that that reform should relate to those areas in need of reform only. In support of that view, it is argued that a statutory restatement is inflexible and incapable of adaption to changing circumstances in the same way that the common law is. There is a need for adaptability to deal with, for example&mdash;taking a modern situation&mdash;proof of communications using modern technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another argument in support of this view is that whenever laws which are the subject of daily focus or which govern daily activity are changed, there is an enormous economic cost to the community. The cost is often unseen and unidentified, but it is substantial nevertheless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that view is put the response by the architect of the bill. It has perhaps already been said, but the bill is substantially the result of a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1987. That report was preceded by a number of events which commenced with a report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs as long ago as 1977. The committee called for a reference to be given to the Australian Law Reform Commission to review the laws of evidence. That was done by the then Attorney-General, Senator Peter Durack QC, in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commissioner in charge of the reference at the Australian Law Reform Commission for most, if not all, of the years that the commission studied the subject was Mr Tim Smith of the Victorian Bar. He is now Mr Justice Smith of the Supreme Court of Victoria. His study found that, in order to coalesce the evidence acts of the different states, it was necessary to incorporate rules in one statute. He found, however, that the evidentiary rules dealt with in the state acts covered virtually all areas of the rules of evidence. So to coalesce the state acts you would have to study, in effect, the whole field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point Mr Justice Smith made was that there were in fact serious problems in virtually all areas of the law of evidence. In some of them, the common law not only had failed, but would almost certainly continue to fail to provide appropriate reforms, or an avenue for reform. He also argued that the case for ossification of the law by statute is not convincing in the light of the fact that the common law itself had shown a capacity to do the same. A particular example he cited was the hearsay rule and its exceptions, its exceptions being a list which was closed approximately a century ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Smith also mentioned the difficulty of getting court-generated reform. Court-generated reform is likely only to come from the hearings in appellate courts or the ultimate court of appeal, the High Court. But only infrequently will an issue of evidence be significant in a case such that it can be taken on appeal as the principal issue and dealt with as a principal ground of appeal, either in an intermediate appeal or in an appeal to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I am not entirely convinced by Mr Justice Smith's response. However, there is experience in other jurisdictions which suggests that a restatement can achieve the practical ends for which this particular restatement is designed. I use the expression `restatement' rather than the expression `code' because the bill does not represent a true codification of evidentiary rules. In some respects it builds on unstated basic principles of the common law. The saga of successive governments endeavouring to bring in legislation capable of being adopted as uniform legislation has gone on for approximately seven years and, in my view, that is long enough. I am prepared on that basis to support the bill, but not without some doubts that it will not have some of the advantages suggested for it, and not without some doubts that it will have some of the disadvantages suggested by the critics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do have one apprehension in relation to a statutory restatement of the rules of evidence. The bill, on enactment, will result in the virtual transfer of responsibility for the principles of evidence to parliaments, this parliament in particular. What had previously been the province of courts and was capable, to some extent, of incremental development over time will now only be capable of change by statutory amendment. That is a perfectly ordinary consequence of the enactment of a bill, but we are dealing here with a bill which would be the subject of focus in every court, in every jurisdiction, across the country on every day that the courts sit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can say similar things of other legislation, like the corporations and securities legislation, but the concern I have is generated by the fact that this bill has not generated any interest whatever within this parliament on its passage through, and it is in fact a significant moment in the history of the administration of justice in this country that the bill appears likely to be passed in the near future. I seriously doubt whether, if significant defects are identified in the future in the bill, it will be possible to generate sufficient political interest and parliamentary interest for amendments to be dealt with with the expedition and the priority that, for my part, I believe they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has taken 17 years from the sowing of the seed or the germination of the seed to this point. It took eight years for the Australian Law Reform Commission to present its report and it has taken nearly 15 years from the time the Attorney-General's reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission was given to reach this point. It is a significant event, and I only regret that more people did not recognise it for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to say anything about the contents of the bill. It would be impossible to do justice to its contents in any significant way, but I do make the point which has been made by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). He referred to the difference between the Commonwealth and New South Wales in relation to the admissibility of legal professional privilege. The difference appears to be that the New South Wales Attorney-General, with considerable support, favours the admissibility of evidence on the basis that documents came into existence for the dominant purpose of the obtaining of legal advice. The position of the Minister for Justice is different and the bill itself is different; it applies the sole purpose test rather than the dominant purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I must say that when I first read the case of Grant v. Downs, which was the first statement of the sole purpose test&mdash;I read it many years ago, so long ago I am not quite sure when it was, but the decision was in 1976&mdash;I thought the High Court had got it wrong and I thought that the dissent of Chief Justice Barwick was right. I have not changed in that view since I first read the case. I note that in Waterford v. the Commonwealth in 1987 the High Court, at least a majority, referred to Grant v. Downs in terms which suggested an approval of it. I do not think that Grant v. Downs was directly in issue before the High Court in Waterford v. the Commonwealth; it was more a question of whether the legal professional privilege rule would be extended to the seeking of legal advice within government, so the exact extent or application of the rule in relation to sole or dominant purpose was not an issue. But I would urge the minister to pay heed to those who have urged before me the New South Wales view, because I think the New South Wales view is right. I commend the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Might I firstly say that we have reached this point in relation to this legislation largely because of the good cooperation of all members and senators in progressing a matter which has required a considerable amount of coordination between the Commonwealth and the states. We now have a piece of legislation which has, with one exception&mdash;which has been noted and commented on in this debate&mdash;been agreed between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales. New South Wales was selected by the other states to be their frontrunner, as it were, in determining a common position that might then be the basis of common legislation, and that is a mark of the great maturity of those involved in the legal profession and those who have involved themselves in the debate thus far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the time, and the fact the opposition has indicated that we will be able to progress this matter through fairly promptly today without difficulty, I will make some quick comments about the sole purpose test, which has been the main issue raised today. We understand that there will be further debate in due course in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government opposes the amendments that will be moved in relation to dominant purpose for the following reasons. The first reason is that the sole purpose test is, in my opinion, all that is necessary to protect the public interest involved when a person consults a lawyer. That person should be able to make a full and frank admission to the lawyer of all relevant facts and circumstances in which he or she seeks legal advice or professional legal assistance in relation to litigation. Any broader test for privilege for communications or documents involving a lawyer has a potential to erode a balancing of other significant public interest, that is, the public interest in courts having available to them all relevant factual material in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are also opposed for cost of justice reasons. The sole purpose test is relatively easy to apply, particularly compared with how a court might be expected to apply a dominant purpose test. This point was accepted in the interim report on evidence by the Australian Law Reform Commission which stated that a dominant purpose test may be more difficult to apply than a sole purpose test. There is perhaps more room for argument and false claims about the appropriate purpose. An examination of the document will often be sufficient for the sole purpose test, but not for the dominant purpose test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sole purpose test has been working well for several years. I confidently expect that the test will be interpreted in the same way as the High Court has interpreted the common law sole purpose test, that is, as explained in Waterford v. the Commonwealth. In Waterford the High Court looked at the purpose for which the document was created in applying the sole purpose test expounded in 1975 by the court in Grant v. Downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to believe that courts would set out to create a difference between the test applying under the bill, the test applying at common law, and the sole purpose test, by deciding that the same language should be treated differently. The comments made by Mr Justice Smith to the Senate committee were that a solicitor's file containing notes of instructions from an advice given to a client might not, on a strict application of this test, be privileged under the bill. It was argued that because a document on the solicitor's file came into existence for a variety of purposes, including a record of work done for the purpose of charging the client, privilege would not attached to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That analysis is not correct. Clauses 118 and 119 afford privilege where evidence would disclose a confidential communication made or the contents of the document prepared for a relevant sole purpose. Even if, for the sake of the argument&mdash;and I certainly do not concede it, I think it is wrong&mdash;a particular document on a solicitor's file is not privileged in its character as a document, it would be privileged if evidence of the document would result in disclosure of a confidential communication made between the client and the lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to address this matter at length here. There will be occasions in other places for the debate to be extended. I do believe that this is a matter in which the Commonwealth is perfectly justified in adhering to the position it took. I note, simply for the record, that originally it was also the position of the New South Wales government as part of an agreed process. It is disappointing that on this issue we are not ad idem, but each government, for its own reasons, thinks that this is an issue of principle. It will be ultimately for the parliament to decide which of those approaches is the correct approach to take. I have no hesitation in advocating the basis and propriety of the view that we are adopting as a government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various procedures for withdrawing from treaties, and the procedure generally depends on the terms of the relevant treaty. Most treaties provide that withdrawal will take effect at the end of a specified period following notice of withdrawal by the withdrawing party. Were the Australian Government to decide that it was no longer in Australia's interests to be bound by a particular international agreement, it would need to observe the conditions for withdrawal provided for in that agreement. All countries enter into international agreements on this understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Constitution, the treaty making power is vested in the Federal Executive. Accordingly, only the Federal government is authorised to enter into or withdraw from an international agreement on behalf of Australia. Withdrawal from an international agreement is a treaty action of similar significance to becoming party to an international agreement, and similar domestic procedures apply. For example, in deciding whether to withdraw from a particular agreement, the Government would usually consult interested sections of the community.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, although the declaration to which Mr Mack refers was made on 20 July 1989, not 28 July 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) A number of Australian nationals employed by the aviation company under contract to the PNG Government have served as pilots for Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) UH-1H helicopters. The PNG Government has repeatedly assured the Australian Government that the aircraft are used in accordance with the guidelines set down and agreed between both governments in July 1989. These provide that the aircraft are to be used for purposes that are limited to such activities as transporting troops and supplies around Bougainville, patrolling and surveillance activities and evacuating military and civilian casualties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware of only one Australian national being wounded while operating a PNGDF UH-1H. He was shot in the leg while flying in central Bougainville in 1992. The Government is not in the possession of any evidence to suggest that at the time of sustaining the wound he was engaged in any offensive military activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian nationals are also employed as helicopter pilots on Bougainville by other civil aviation companies contracted by the PNG Government. The Government regards the details of their employment and activities as matters for the PNG Government and the contractors and individuals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) serving as loan personnel with the PNGDF under the Defence Cooperation program have from time to time visited North Solomons Province. Their visits have been at the request of the PNG Government under the terms of the letters signed in 1977 by the Papua New Guinea and Australian Ministers for Defence on the use of ADF personnel in politically sensitive areas. Such visits are approved on a case by case basis by the Australian Minister for Defence. They have been limited to providing technical advice for the PNGDF and Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC). There has been no ADF direct involvement in mounting or participating in PNGDF operations on Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware that there may be other Australians living in Bougainville. One Australian has been reported to be living in BRA controlled territory in central Bougainville and there may be an Australian teacher in the Talena district. In addition there are several business people (mostly in the construction industry) present in Bougainville at any one time. As many of these people do not inform the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby of their movements, it is impossible to provide further details. The Government has no reason to believe however that any of these people are engaged in "military or military-style operations" in Bougainville.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Some of the Australian nationals employed as UH-1H pilots by the PNG firm contracted by the PNG Government, may have been involved in conducting surveillance of the PNG/Solomon Islands border. The Government is unaware of any further activity that would be relevant to this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Government understands that the PNGDF carries out the internationally accepted process of calling on vessels suspected of illegally crossing the PNG/Solomon Islands border to halt and be searched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is aware of incidents where vessels crossing the border have been fired upon by the PNGDF on occasions when those vessels have refused to allow a search or have fired at the PNGDF. The Amnesty International report for 1993 contains allegations of unarmed vessels being fired at by the PNGDF. The Government is not able to confirm the accuracy of those reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Australian Government has a keen interest in the human rights situation on Bougainville and has regularly engaged the PNG Government, including at ministerial level, on reported incidents of human rights abuses. During regular visits to Bougainville since mid-1991, Australian High Commission officials have investigated PNGDF practices on Bougainville and its relationship with local communities. Human rights issues were given particular emphasis during the visit to Bougainville in April 1994 by an Australian parliamentary delegation which was funded by the Australian Government. Some of the issues raised have included the alleged execution of Ken Savia (a former minister in the Bougainville Interim Government), treatment of BRA captured by the PNGDF and the detention without trial of BRA members. The Australian Government has also strongly supported the proposal that Papua New Guinea establish a Human Rights Commission and has offered both financial and technical assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frequency with which the Australian Government has engaged the PNG Government on human rights issues makes it impracticable to give comprehensive detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) There are no international agreements to which Australia is a party concerning matters dealt with in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978.
