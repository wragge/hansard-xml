<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President and I have agreed to a proposal by the Parliamentary Education Office that a new video on the role and operation of the parliament be produced. Many of you will be aware of an earlier film, produced first in 1989 and updated in 1991, which was also commissioned by the Parliamentary Education Office. The many changes in the membership of both houses since then, and the need to show a fresh image of the role of parliament, necessitates a replacement video. Please reflect on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tender to make the new video was won by ABC TV Marketing. Its team of script writers has been working closely with the PEO and with senior officers of both chamber departments to produce a script which will focus on the legislative, representational and scrutiny aspects of parliament, together with the role of the executive government and of parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director of the video, Mr David Barrow, is sensitive to the parliamentary environment and is acutely aware of the discretion that needs to be exercised in making a video such as we envisage. The success of the enterprise will depend very much on the cooperation and understanding which the production team receives. I commend it and the important work that it is doing for the parliament to you. If you find over the course of the next several sitting weeks that a camera crew is operating within the building and is wishing to take footage of you going about your parliamentary duties, I would appreciate your cooperation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of Auditor-General's audit report No. 20 1993-94&mdash;Efficiency Audit: Northern Land Council</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report I have just tabled is the committee's review of the Auditor-General's efficiency audit of the Northern Land Council. The audit was conducted at the request of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), following concerns raised about the financial administration of the Northern Land Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report was tabled in December 1993 and referred by the House to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs committee. The audit report covered a wide range of issues affecting the council's financial administration and made 52 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the audit report was tabled, the Northern Land Council had agreed with 49 of the recommendations and had begun to implement many of them. A number of the recommendations agreed to received only qualified support from the Northern Land Council. The committee decided that in reviewing the audit report it would concentrate solely on the recommendations to which the Northern Land Council had not agreed and on a number to which the council had given only qualified agreement. In a general response to the audit, the Northern Land Council welcomed the efficiency audit report but stressed that the results of the audit revealed no evidence of serious illegal or improper action on its part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes that the Northern Land Council has agreed with the vast majority of the recommendations; ATSIC has agreed with all of the recommendations affecting it; the relevant agencies have agreed to work together; and the Australian National Audit Office will conduct a follow-up audit in 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 3 of the audit report was that the Northern Land Council incorporate the financial reporting of trust account moneys in a note to its financial statements since they are funds of the land council while held in trust. The accounts should also include a statement concerning compliance with section 35 of the act during the year. The Northern Land Council initially disagreed with this recommendation. The Northern Land Council claimed that as this information could be commercially or socially sensitive it published global financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NLC advised the committee that its original disagreement was to the publication of the details of individual transactions of the royalty trust associations. The NLC has now agreed to publish the income and expenditure statements of the trust accounts. This has been given effect in the Northern Land Council's 1992-93 annual report. The audit office indicated that it believed recommendation 3 has now been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 18 the audit office recommended that the Northern Land Council implement a time allocation mechanism to allow the project based expenditure control system to allocate salaries and administrative overhead costs to project tasks. The NLC disagreed with this recommendation, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Land Council questions the practicability of this recommendation especially in small sections working on complex inter-related issues. Time allocation may be appropriate in relation to projects which are or could be externally funded. This issue is being reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Land Council said that its disagreement with this recommendation was on the basis of the unknown practicality and consequences of time allocation for staff time on all projects. It objected to implementing this recommendation without first establishing the benefits. ATSIC accepted the Northern Land Council's argument that the practicality of the proposal is questionable. The NLC advised that it will review the proposal and, if it appears beneficial, will implement it on a trial basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NLC advised that its 1994-95 budget will allocate salaries and overheads to departmental areas to more accurately reflect the costs associated with each department. The Australian National Audit Office has indicated that it supports this move by the NLC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee notes the changes being made by the NLC for the more accurate allocation of administrative costs and its willingness to evaluate and trial time allocation to project tasks. The committee is satisfied with the NLC's response on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 24 the audit office recommended that ATSIC recommend to the minister that he apply section 34 of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, where appropriate, to include any subsection 64(1) surpluses of administrative funds from the preceding year in the approved estimates of expenditure for the current year; in other words, to carry over funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the receipt of mining royalties by the Commonwealth or Northern Territory governments, mining royalty equivalents are paid from Commonwealth special appropriation to the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account&mdash;ABTA&mdash;which, in turn, makes payments to the land councils under section 63. These arrangements result in land councils receiving in excess of 70 per cent of their subsection 64(1) income payments in August and February each year. As the NLC's requirements for funds vary between $600,000 and $900,000 per month, this creates cash management problems. The decline in mining royalties and their equivalent payments to the ABTA has resulted in land councils requiring more supplementary subsection 64(7) funding to meet their administrative costs in pursuit of their statutory functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office was concerned that the drain on ABTA reserves be minimised. It pointed out by way of contrast that the Central Land Council had offset administrative surpluses against next year's budget and decreased their draw on the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NLC disagreed with this recommendation querying which circumstances would be considered appropriate. The audit office believes that the appropriateness of an approach to a surplus is a matter for resolution between the minister and the land council. In a letter to the NLC following the release of the audit report the minister indicated his support for the recommendation. ATSIC has also supported the recommendation. The NLC said that it will make a submission to the minister on its interpretation of the legal position. The committee strongly believes that surpluses of administrative funds should be carried over to the following year, wherever possible, to avoid further drawing on Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 5 the audit office recommended that the Northern Land Council cease the practice of providing advances to the chairman and council members and recover all outstanding amounts forthwith. The Northern Land Council gave only qualified agreement to this recommendation. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Land Council is placing greater scrutiny on advances but reserves the right to provide advances under extenuating circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The Northern Land Council makes advances to council members of travelling and mileage allowances. Some other advances are made to council members for non-council related expenses when requested. These moneys are advanced on the grounds that the council members will become entitled to sitting fees at some time in the future and that moneys advanced to them can be recovered from these sitting fees. The relevant remuneration tribunal determination provides that the chairman must certify attendance before payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office considers that the provision of cash advances and payment of the chairman's personal credit card accounts by the Northern Land Council&mdash;subject to later repayment by the chairman&mdash;and the making of advances to council members is inappropriate and in contravention of the full council resolution prohibiting advances to members. The committee believes that the audit report recommendation should be fully implemented. The committee understands that the full council of the Northern Land Council considered this matter at its meeting in mid-March. It deferred making a decision until its next full meeting but affirmed that, in the meantime, the decision of the full meeting of June 1987 to cease advances should stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation No. 6 the audit office recommended that the Northern Land Council seek the advice of the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of Finance as to the appropriateness of its present flexible remuneration arrangements and develop guidelines for their continuing application. The Department of Industrial Relations advised that the benefits included in the Northern Land Council's flexible remuneration packages are not significantly different from those applied by other Commonwealth statutory authorities to their senior executives and other senior staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report also points out that prior to implementing the flexible remuneration packages the Northern Land Council did not consult with, nor gain the approval of, the Department of Industrial Relations, as was required by the Aboriginal Land Rights Act at the time. In addition, the Northern Land Council did not consult with the Department of Finance regarding superannuation arrangements for those staff in receipt of the packages. The audit office points out that, as this has not been approved by the Minister for Finance, it may constitute an unapproved superannuation arrangement which, under section 7 of the Supervisory Mechanisms Act, is void in law. The Northern Land Council may also be acting in contravention of its superannuation trust deed if it does not allow increased contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Land Council operates under a paid rates award&mdash;the Public Service Union (Central and Northern Land Councils) Award 1990&mdash;which specifies the salary range for staff. Flexible packaging may be negotiated with the union in the context of workplace bargaining. However, the audit report says the Northern Land Council gave only qualified support to this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evidence provided, the committee believes that the Northern Land Council should be able to negotiate acceptance of these remuneration arrangements. While these negotiations may take some time, their effective resolution will be able to be assessed in the follow-up audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommendation 52, the audit office recommended that ATSIC encourage regional councils to consult extensively with land councils especially in relation to the development of their regional plans. The Northern Land Council gave only qualified support to this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that both bodies have their own statutory objectives and responsibilities. The committee agrees with the audit office that a closer relationship and improved coordination would benefit the effectiveness of both organisations. The proposal by ATSIC for the development of a formal protocol which would detail the specific roles and responsibilities of the respective organisations is strongly endorsed by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that there is now almost total agreement on the 52 recommendations of the audit report. The Northern Land Council has recognised the need to improve its administrative systems and management practices and has made considerable progress towards achieving these improvements. The Northern Land Council has indicated a strategic and corporate planning process and taken action to address some of the immediate organisational issues. The Northern Land Council's action plan for the implementation of the Auditor-General's recommendations indicates a strong commitment to improving the effectiveness of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the implementation of these changes will result in a stronger, more effective council, to the greater benefit of its constituents. I thank the committee secretariat&mdash;in particular, Allan Kelly, Trish Carling and Penne Humphries&mdash;for its hard work on the preparation of this report, and I thank all other committee members for their involvement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted that this report has come before the House because there is a widespread perception throughout the Australian community that mismanagement of Aboriginal affairs and organisations takes place fairly frequently. This is why ATSIC has its own internal audit office, which is doing an excellent job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be stated that this particular audit inquiry arose because Senator Grant Tambling raised it in Senate estimates committee hearings in November 1992 and May 1993. I think it is significant that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, (Mr Tickner) said that `even before allegations were made in the Senate, I had independently sought advice from the Auditor-General on the need for an investigation into the financial administration of the Northern Land Council'. That investigation was warranted. Fifty-two areas were found where financial mismanagement was in place. Having said that, I make the point that both the Northern Land Council and ATSIC have bent over backwards to ensure that the shortcomings are remedied and that things are now going on the right and even keel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee has a responsibility, not only to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community, but to this parliament and, indeed, to the whole of Australia. I wonder whether this particular case is merely the tip of the iceberg. It is in the best interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that every opportunity is provided to investigate charges of mismanagement. I am aware of two cases in my own electorate&mdash;one which the Federal Police are investigating and another which the state police are investigating. I am flooded with complaints from Aboriginal people about mismanagement. This is not in the best interests of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island community or in the best interests of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the audit office report. I certainly welcome the fact that both the Northern Land Council and ATSIC have really taken every possible step to make sure that these errors do not occur again. I believe that we should have the opportunity of having investigations, wherever those charges are made. It is not right that they should be swept under the table. It is in the best interests of Aboriginal people that guidance and help are provided in the financial management of their own affairs. </PARA>

<PARA>Mr Speaker, you can see that I did have a vested interest in sitting down at the appropriate time&mdash;I had to make way for the next speaker, who has a most important statement to make relevant to the interests of Australia in Antarctica. The Australian Antarctic presence is a very significant one and in the last week or 10 days we have had a very interesting concentration on Antarctica. Many of us would have seen the last of the six series on Antarctica by David Attenborough screened by the ABC last Thursday night, and the Andrew Denton program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Money or the Gun on Ice</EMPHASIS> screened last Wednesday night, which I must declare an interest in. It was an excellent program and my son was the director of it. I am very proud of him and Andrew Denton for the program they produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From last Monday, we had available for viewing here in Parliament House&mdash;on the House of Representatives side on the first floor&mdash;a superb and wonderful collection of Antarctic photography arranged by the Australian Antarctic Division. I congratulate it on the exhibition it has put together. It is superlative, it is first rate, and I would recommend every person in Australia, if they are going to be in Canberra, to make a point to see this exhibition which will been on show until the end of May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this debate today which celebrates the 40th anniversary of the establishment of our base at Mawson. Tonight we have the annual dinner with the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance, a cross-party, totally bipartisan informal group of members and others who have been to Antarctica or who take a major interest in it and work for the benefit of Antarctica. As well, on Wednesday night we had the screening of another documentary in the Parliament House theatrette. So this does tend to focus the attention of Australia on Antarctica at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 20th century Australia's expeditions to Antarctica have won international recognition for their contributions to the knowledge of the continent. Since 1936, when we took over the area that Britain had, we have exercised or claimed sovereignty on 42 per cent of Antarctica&mdash;Australian Antarctic territory. The expeditions of Mawson in 1911 and 1914 were quite dramatic. You might recall, Mr Speaker, that he and some others of his party were late getting back to the base, the ship had to sail without them and they had to winter and spend the whole year there waiting for the ship to come back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is of some significance that that great and wonderful Australian photographer, Frank Hurley, was with Mawson at that time. It is relevant, of course, to the exhibition which is on show in the House at the moment because the photographic coverage of Antarctica has gone on, in Australian terms, since Frank Hurley went south and wintered with Mawson. I know that Mawson and others found that eating the livers of dogs tended to make the soles of their feet fall off because of the excess of vitamin A, but I do not know whether Frank Hurley ever had that wonderful experience. I hope he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I would recommend and hope that when you visit the exhibition you will take particular note of the photograph taken by Frank Hurley not when he was with Mawson but when he was with the Shackleton expedition. It is a photograph of Shackleton's ship, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Endurance</EMPHASIS>, which was thrust out of the sea by the pack ice and was later crushed and sank. This particular photograph was taken by Hurley at noon on midwinter's day, 1914. The ship is shown as pushed right up out of the ice&mdash;the sky, of course, is pitch black because at that stage there was 24-hours darkness&mdash;and he exposed the film by causing a series of 36 explosions around the scene at the same time. It is a wonderfully dramatic photograph, and I am particularly delighted that it was given to me by the two twin daughters of Frank Hurley, who live in my electorate at Coffs Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's scientific association with Antarctica has gone on well beyond the Mawson expedition. In 1947-48 the first of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, ANARE, set up research stations on Heard Island, an Australian territory and our only active volcano, and Macquarie Island, which is actually part of Tasmania. In 1954 Mawson station was set up. It is the oldest continually operated of all Antarctic continental stations. In 1957 we established our base at Davis. In 1959 the Americans gave us their Wilkes base which we later transformed&mdash;10 years later, by the way, in 1969&mdash;into Casey. That was when the increase of snow and ice forced the abandonment of Wilkes. Casey, like the other Antarctic stations, has been rebuilt on a new site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Antarctic Division was established by the government in 1948 as a permanent agency to administer and provide logistic support for ANARE, the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories. The division enhances Australia's scientific, environmental, political, strategic and economic interests in Antarctic and subantarctic regions and preserves our sovereignty over the Australian Antarctic territory. The science program aims to improve our understanding of Antarctica and enhance our influence in the region by undertaking valuable research. This research covers the biological sciences, atmospheric and space physics, glaciology, medical research, science support, geoscience, meteorology and oceanography. In passing, I would like to pay tribute to the tremendous contribution made by the Assistant Director, Science, of the Antarctic Division, Dr Pat Quilty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the pioneers of scientific research in Antarctica and we remain a very active participant in international research programs. Some examples of this are that our marine science program has added to the world knowledge of krill and the whole Antarctic ecosystem, and our plant studies have sought to determine what plants grow where and how variable they are. One of the fascinating things one finds when visiting Casey is the mosses, which grow quite close to the base. During the winter they are covered by several metres of ice, but with the thaw they come out; there is the moss, resplendent in its beautiful green, together with legless mites which live within it and survive the dreadful Antarctic winter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also undertaking land based studies of vertebrate animals, the life forms of lakes and the study of fossils up to 4.2 million years old. Only in the last week we have had this wonderful discovery of a new dinosaur in Antarctica. This is part of the continuing research program which Australia and other countries are embarked on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have discovered fish with antifreeze proteins. I am sure that, because of that discovery, in the fullness of time significant advances will be made in research affecting the health of humans. We have discovered plants which make their own sunscreens. Again, this is something that will be of value to humanity. We drill the ice to get climate information over millions of years. The international drilling operation has revealed the evolution of the earth's crust, from a combined surface and underground observatory. We are very involved with upper atmospheric physics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mawson station was established in 1954. I pay tribute to those early expeditioners. What a wonderful job they did. I would also like to pay particular tribute to Dr Phillip Law, who was the initial director of the Antarctic Division. I believe Phil Law is a man whose contribution to Australia has never been fully recognised. He did a remarkable job. He established Mawson&mdash;named in honour of Sir Douglas Mawson&mdash;on 13 February 1954. Ever since, it has had a remarkable record of scientific operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1955 its scientific operations were among the most sophisticated in Antarctica and included the first cosmic ray observations south of the Antarctic Circle. From 1968 to 1974 the division launched the geological and glaciological research program in Prince Charles Mountains, 400 kilometres inland from Mawson. I must say that one of my most fascinating experiences was, unfortunately, not to have visited the Prince Charles Mountains but to have seen some of the coal that has been brought from there and also some of the fossils of leaves which very much look like gum leaves and which provide evidence that Australia and Antarctica were once joined. I pay great tribute to all Antarctic expeditioners and the contribution they made to world science. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to second this motion. I am also delighted to speak on this important debate, which is in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the first Australian base on the Antarctic continent. This base was Mawson, which is now one of the three permanent bases that Australia has on Antarctica&mdash;Mawson, Casey and Davis&mdash;and, of course, there is one on sub-Antarctica at Macquarie Island. I know of no-one who has been to Antarctica and whose life has not been changed by that experience, who has not been awed by the experience. Antarctica fascinates because of the challenge of the unknown and of the danger, because of its awesome size and dramatic beauty, and because of the scientific interest in this unique environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Australia has played such an important role, as we claim 42 per cent of the Antarctic territory. In 1933 Britain transferred to Canberra sovereign rights of the territory&mdash;all of Antarctica south of 60 degrees south and between the longitudes of 160 degrees and 145 degrees east, except for a small part claimed by France in 1924. Australia formally accepted control in 1936. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's associations with Antarctica go back to its known early European history: to James Cook's great southern voyage in 1772-75, the first to cross the Antarctic Circle. Many of the pioneering journeys of the 1800s in search of knowledge left Australian ports. In the 20th century Australia's scientific expeditions to Antarctica have won international recognition for their contributions to knowledge of the continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica is also of fundamental importance to Australia. There are three key elements in Australia's approach to Antarctica: its nearness, our sovereignty, and international cooperation, both diplomatic and scientific. For Australia, the most crucial point is that Antarctica is part of our region, our neighbourhood. It dominates the southern approaches in our weather. This nearness means that Antarctica is part of Australia's area of strategic significance. It also means that weather patterns of the Antarctic, the Antarctic cold transmitted by air and sea currents, have a direct effect on the Australian land mass. It affects our ecology and contributes to Australia having a great variety of weather conditions. Australia, incidentally, is the second driest continent after Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This nearness also makes it natural, perhaps inevitable, that Australians should have been among the first and the most extensive explorers of Antarctica. Our records of exploration and scientific endeavour go back now over 90 years and are the basis of Australia's claims to sovereignty over a considerable area of Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Nevertheless, Australia has been one of the pioneer supporters of peaceful international cooperation in the Antarctic&mdash;hence the title of the exhibition on the first floor of this building that I urge all honourable members and visitors to visit. It is entitled `Antarctica: land of peace and science'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were heavily involved in the international geophysical year in 1957-58. The level of international cooperation in Antarctica at that time involving many interested nations convinced us, as it did other nations, of the need to find a way of maintaining and developing that cooperation. We were among the founders of the Antarctic Treaty. More recently, Australia played a leading role in the conclusion of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the headquarters of which is located in Hobart. </PARA>

When we think of Antarctica we think of it as being all white, but it has the most incredible range of colours. All this, and more, is Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our ever increasing search for minerals, some people recently argued that Antarctica should be mined. Not satisfied with cutting down rainforests or desecrating some of the most beautiful and fragile parts of the world, the miners cast their covetous, greedy eyes on the last remaining wilderness&mdash;Antarctica. Imagine the scene described above with a great overburden of mining waste. Imagine the whiteness spoilt forever by huge oil slicks or the stillness of Antarctica pierced by the noise of mining activities. Recently the 39 nations of the Antarctic Treaty formally banned mining for 50 years in this the last wilderness continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica has been designated as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty is a substantial advance by treaty nations in seeking comprehensive protection for the Antarctic as a great wilderness on earth. The protocol prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources other than scientific research. Australia recently ratified the Madrid protocol. Australia's concern for the environmental aspects of Antarctica is reflected in its current science program. It is interesting that in a world dominated by conflicts, of competing and conflicting ideologies and philosophies, long before there was international cooperation in other spheres, there was cooperation on Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the last clean place of any size left on earth. How long it can stay that way I sometimes wonder because there will most likely be increasing numbers of tourists, ships, garbage and pollution in general. Already elements of pollution are there. I pay tribute to the Australian government for its clean-up measures at our bases in Antarctica. I believe that our record in Antarctica is second to none. When I was in Antarctica, as well as visiting the Australian bases I visited the Chinese and Soviet bases. Our protection for the environment was better than that practised at those bases. Recently, the Tasmanian government has agreed to the return of rubbish from Antarctica. I congratulate it for that. At the April meeting of the Antarctic Treaty nations Australia was successful in ensuring that the treaty nations adopt guidelines consistent with treaty protocols for tourism to Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the continent of Antarctica itself is largely a frozen wasteland, the waters around it are the richest reservoir of life on the planet. They support the familiar large animals of the far southern seas&mdash;penguins, gulls, seals, dolphins and whales. The sea is also rich in krill, which unfortunately has been overfished by the Japanese and others. If we damage the region badly, which, even with the best will in the world, mining and tourism would inevitably do, we would tear an enormous hole in the fabric of the planetary ecology and cause damage elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica is without a doubt the world's greatest wilderness. This vast land and its surrounding seas are dominated by nature&mdash;by cold and wind, ice and snow. The continent itself is barren. Antarctic wildlife depends for its survival on food from the ocean. Humans can exist there only with outside support. In such a place many countries have decided to establish bases in which people can live and work. They have done this for many reasons but predominantly it is the desire for understanding. Antarctic research has brought new life to great questions about the earth, its geophysics, its geology, its ecosystems, its atmosphere and its place in the universe. It has also provided the world with an unprecedented opportunity for cooperation between people of many nations in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge. The Antarctic region is valuable to the people of Earth because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. This motion pays tribute to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve the Antarctic in as pristine a state as possible. This is not too high a price to pay, and the scientific and environmental integrity of Antarctica is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity or in the name of dubious short-term economic enrichment. We on earth have mined, farmed and raped much of the world. We have done tremendous damage to this planet. Surely there is one place on earth that can be left in its pristine state for the benefit of everyone and for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to all who have been associated with Antarctica, from the early explorers who showed such great courage and determination as they travelled into the unknown to the early scientists and, over more recent years, those who continue to study in Antarctica. Here I would like to pay tribute to someone from my own electorate of Throsby, the late Bob Dovers. Bob and his father were the only father and son team to visit Antarctica. His father, George, wintered in Antarctica from 1911 to 1914, and Bob twice wintered there from 1947 to 1948 and again from 1951 to 1952.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I pay tribute to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) for introducing this motion into the House, and endorse not only his remarks but also those remarks made by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). As both honourable members have reflected, and as I am bold and almost on the edge of the standing orders in reflecting, I suspect the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) will be similarly making a bipartisan contribution to this debate because of the degree to which all of the Antarctic and Antarctic research has reflected bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>

I wandered through there and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would understand my sentiment when I recalled the return of the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) from an expedition to Antarctic who brought back what are quite remarkable photographs of his experience in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those of us who, in our time in this place, have reflected less than charitably on what we saw as the relative insensitivity to some issues of the honourable member for Maranoa. We may well have been labelling him unfairly, looking at him in the light of his photography; or it may be that Antarctica wove on him the same spell it weaves on everyone else and revealed a side to him that others of us have not given him credit for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Be that as it may, this morning I want particularly to focus on the second part of the motion that the honourable member for Cowper has brought into the House calling on us to celebrate this year, the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Australian base at Mawson. Without any sense of parochialism, Mr Deputy Speaker, I stand here as a South Australian acutely aware of the contribution made to South Australia's academia and to Australia's Antarctic exploration by Sir Douglas Mawson. I, as you know, was won over to an affection for Antarctica after reading Lennard Bickel's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">This Accursed Land</EMPHASIS>, which was the story of Mawson's Antarctic expedition. I could not believe the courage, endurance, bravery and determination that Mawson had shown against quite impossible odds. How could one be so lonely, so cold and so ill for so long and still persevere?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up just one of the comments made by the honourable member for Cowper. As I recall the story of Mawson's most remarkable return, it was in fact alone that he returned. It was alone that he observed that the ship had sailed and it was this emaciated skeleton of a man called Mawson who, having lost both of his companions, Mertz and Ninnis, struggled over the embankment towards the base and was not recognised by his companions. The one companion who rushed up to him opened Mawson's parka and said, `My God, who are you?' so emaciated was Mawson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not allow me to go on in detail, but I reflect on Mawson's courage as alone he had made this almost one-month journey, having lost both of his companions, only to return to find that the ship had sailed and to find a handful of his fellow explorers who had remained at the base lest any one of the three of them on the Mawson expedition should return, as Mawson did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us who have visited Antarctica&mdash;I was in the presence of the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Cowper when we, with Mr Mountford, visited Antarctica&mdash;were caught up in its majesty, its grandeur and its isolation. In many ways, the awe that one feels at this remarkable land resembles some sort of spiritual experience. In picking up the first part of the motion of the honourable member for Cowper, I want to recognise the valuable and significant contribution made to world science by Australian Antarctic expeditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something of a touch of irony in the simple fact that I represent an electorate that is totally different from Antarctica in all senses. My electorate is both hot and dry. Antarctica is not recognised by most people as a dry place. Currently gripping my electorate is a certain obsession with whether or not it is going to rain. The information as to whether or not it is going to rain in much of southern Australia is probably held in the ice core of Antarctica. Much of the scientific and meteorological work that is being done in Antarctica will have a major impact on the Australian climate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Then went up a long, fairly steep slope thickly covered with snow, sinking half way to knees . . . A few moments later I was dangling on end of rope in crevasse, sledge creeping to mouth. I had time to say to myself `So this is the end', expecting every moment the sledge to crash on my head and both of us to go to the bottom unseen below. Then I thought of the food left uneaten in the sledge&mdash;and, as the sledge stopped without coming down, I thought of Providence again giving me a chance. The chance looked very small as the rope had sawed into the overhanding lid, my finger ends all damaged, myself weak and as it had been warm day I had taken off most clothing and left rest very open&mdash;all now filled with snow and fingers fast chilling.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to Antarctica was the experience of a lifetime and allowed us to reflect on some of the diary entries of Mawson and to begin to understand the extent of the personal agony and courage that Mawson, Phillip Law and so many others displayed in the cause of science and understanding our planet earth&mdash;and in the cause of research in a range of areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has four permanent bases there: Macquarie Island, Mawson, Davis and Casey. It was the Casey station that we visited in 1986. I am probably the only party leader to have visited that area. I hope others will take up that challenge. By doing so we start to understand the range of linkages and interconnection between Australia and that continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientific endeavour of the Australian Antarctica division includes the examination of the biological science area, atmospheric and space-related issues, glaciology in some detail&mdash;and medical research as well. In saluting those involved in our efforts on that great continent to the south, I especially salute those who, over winter each year&mdash;from April to October&mdash;in the cause of science in effect are locked in at Mawson, Davis and Casey in those extreme conditions. I hope that when this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> is relayed to them at some stage they will read that both sides of the parliament join in extending a greeting to those with that dedicated commitment which has seen Australians carrying out their work and scientific endeavours in 1994 and all other winters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that regard that I highlight to the House that a lot of the frontal systems of our weather pattern originate around the edge of the Antarctic continent. Katabatic winds descend from the South Pole. In many places the ice mass is higher than 10,000 feet. It is quite high even near the coast, such as the Law Dome, which is named after Phillip Law, a distant relative of my wife, Judy. It has now been drilled for the information going back through thousands of years that can be gained on the various layers of the Law Dome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those katabatic winds sweep out to sea and then start to swirl in a way which creates a series of low systems which, in turn, create the south-west fronts that the honourable member for Wakefield and other members have referred to. The import of the weather pattern on southern Australia is real, and that is why we need more research and monitoring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our hope and prayer, as we speak this day, that there might well be a fair dinkum south-west front in the making.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there was much debate about the decision to name Australia's first station on Antarctica after Sir Douglas Mawson, because his career in exploration and science speaks for itself. It started in 1907 when he was a member of the Shackleton expedition. My first interest in Antarctica was excited when I received a school prize about the Shackleton expedition which contained a lot of photographs taken by Frank Hurley. Mawson reached the South Magnetic Pole. He climbed Mount Erebus and published observations relating to mineralogy, terrestrial magnetism and a wide range of other subjects. He headed south again in 1911 as leader of the largely Australian expedition at that time to Cape Denison, which is one of the windiest places on earth, although the honourable member for Cowper and I went to a pretty windy place on Heard Island. Who can but wonder and feel inspired by the epic journey of lone survival which Mawson endured after the death of his two companions, Mertz and Ninnis, and by the privation endured during a second winter there?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advancement of science and exploration were the foremost tasks confronting the expedition. He mapped more than 1,500 kilometres of coast, probed 500 kilometres inland and gathered a lot of scientific data. He was knighted in 1914 and had his book, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home of the Blizzard</EMPHASIS>, a classic of polar literature, published. He led two expeditions to Antarctica between 1929 and 1931. The literature describes them as cruises, but some of us know that there is no such thing as cruising in Antarctic waters, as has been mentioned by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). We travelled for some time at the rate of half a knot. The former member for La Trobe, Peter Milton, who I think is still in the House, was rescued by a Soviet ship when he was stuck travelling at naught for too long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowper and I were caught in pretty terrible circumstances, being confronted with 20-metre waves. The ship was rolling 45 degrees each way. If it had rolled 60 degrees, then it would have gone upside down. It certainly was not a cruise. We lost some 20 drums of fuel. We also lost quite a lot of equipment, which we saw go overboard. It was rather a tense time; certainly not a cruise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mawson, after his active involvement, was involved with the establishment of the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947 and was chairman of the national committee on Antarctic research. The Mawson station was established on 13 February 1954. It consisted of simple huts and support buildings. It was a base. It was a home and a workplace of sorts. It was from there that we established Australian pre-eminence in glaciology, physics and biology. Two other stations were built&mdash;Casey and Davis. Mawson, Casey and Davis were rebuilt and modernised in the 1980s. We have the new Mawson station. </PARA>

<PARA>It is with the greatest sense of urgency that I move this private member's motion today. It is with urgency because, despite the increasing number of studies carried out on Australia's coastline, our most precious heritage is being degraded and destroyed at a rapidly accelerated rate. There is no greater tribute to our ignorance than the monuments we have created in coastal Australia. We have all seen them, and we should all share in the shame of their existence. They range from the relatively small civil constructions to unprecedented engineering blunders such as breakwaters along estuary mouths for a shipping trade that no longer exists, but they are structures that have changed the course of rivers, the coastline and adjacent beaches to their detriment. Of course, there is the plethora of ocean outfalls for sewage that pour enormous volumes of land-derived wastes and all the soluble nutrients and toxins of a modern, industrialised society into the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our coastal landscape is obscured by high-rise buildings that capture the view&mdash;and damn everyone else's! The mangrove  wetlands have been killed and filled, often with garbage, so that a golf course, perhaps, could be built. Coastal roads that have been carved into cliff faces have accelerated erosion as well as created traffic congestion. Sand mines have raped our beaches of heavy metals and have left a legacy of bitou bush and other imported plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had decades of piecemeal encroachment. Why? It is because we are lovers of the sea. The suntanned Aussie surfer is an international symbol that characterises our aspirations. The coast is where most Australians want to live; where there is the greatest growth; where the grab for land is taking place&mdash;be it wetland, sand dune or headland. The development of our coastline must be very profitable judging by the glossy brochures advertising, `Your last opportunity for a place in the sun.' Yet it is profit for the few and a loss for the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the area which I represent has been dubbed `a blue water wonderland' by the local council&mdash;indeed, it is. A total of 330,000 tourists visited Port Stephens last year and spent $1.3 million. They come in increasing numbers to enjoy its magnificent water sports: its swimming, boating and fishing. The local economy thrives on the Port Stephens festival, the big game fish competition, which is the biggest in the world, and the myriad of spin-offs that tourism brings to the area; yet the Port Stephens council has currently approved a development against the wishes of local residents. It will allow a magnificent stand of trees, estimated to be over 200 years of age, to be bulldozed and land to be filled by up to two metres of sand so that all building sites will be above the required AHD level. The local Aboriginal Land Council has claimed it as a sacred women's birth site. It is a unique living laboratory and an avifauna haven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local government does not have the resources and most councillors do not have the expertise. Too often they see development as offering a promise of income for urgently needed infrastructure in their own patch. They are bullied, even threatened and hoodwinked, by the glossy environmental impact statements that boast the name of a supposedly reputable firm of environmental scientists which has been consulting with the developer all along on how to get a successful result from council. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I saw this motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> last week, it was with a great deal of interest that I put my name down to speak. As was the case with the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), I have been involved in local government on the mid north coast of New South Wales for a number of years, representing an area that has experienced a great deal of growth at a fairly rapid rate. I have also been involved in a number of fairly contentious developmental decisions concerning the coastline and in a number of exercises in local government whereby we have had to restore damage that had been done by previous development and protect development that had been put at risk by poor planning in years gone by.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very complicated and complex issue. The honourable member for Paterson has addressed a number of different issues in his motion. While I agree with some aspects, I certainly disagree with others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point in the motion before the House is that coastal development is accelerating and is indiscriminate. It is certainly accelerating, but I do not believe all coastal development is indiscriminate. I am sure that the honourable member for Paterson, with his local government background, would probably agree that times have been changing, albeit slowly, in the attitude of some developers to development along the coast. The development can be done in a balanced fashion, taking into account the environmental concerns that we continue to face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with some of his remarks relating to the bodies that are damaging the coastal environment. We had the opportunity to experience the doggedness of the bureaucracy through the augmentation of a sewerage treatment works in the local government area I represented some years ago. I, and another fellow who was representative of the grazing community, fought long and hard for almost two years to establish a dry land disposal system in one of the town areas in that council area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We kept on running up a lane and into brick walls because it was not an acceptable practice to the engineers involved, the public works department. Since then, I believe, they have changed their attitude to a certain extent. But certainly it was not a viable option as far as they were concerned at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not just the developers and it is not just state government; the professionals in many of the bureaucracies around Australia are not prepared to contemplate lateral thinking or change. So let us not blame it all on the developers. Today we are seeing more and more developers who are prepared to consider the environmental impact. I agree with the honourable member for Paterson that from time to time the environment is paid only lip-service in regard to the environmental impact studies that have to be done. Certainly you can get a study written whichever way you want. On the other side of the coin, opponents to development can get environmental impact statements done the way they want. Whoever is paying the fee will get the report tilted in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was extremely difficult in local government as far as planning was concerned when two fairly eminent professionals in a particular area held diametrically opposed views on what impact there was going to be on the environment with a particular development. It became very onerous for the average person representing local government in making these decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not brand all coastal development as derogatory to the environment, or as indiscriminate. It is changing. The Commonwealth has a role to play, albeit not in an overriding sense. We should be working with the states. If we are to create a national policy, it certainly should be implemented by way of state legislation. That is if we are going to stick with the view&mdash;that I think still prevails&mdash;that land use decisions and legislation and planning decisions and legislation should remain with the states. I know that they probably vary around Australia, but certainly in New South Wales at the moment the New South Wales government's coastal policy controls to a certain extent development within that one-kilometre zone and requires an environmental study prior to rezoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was not aware, as the honourable member for Paterson informed the House, that this does not include Newcastle, Sydney and Wollongong. The impact on the coastal environment in those areas is probably more to do with sewage outfalls&mdash;not so much sandmining. The coastal strips are probably more highly developed as far as residential areas are concerned than other parts of New South Wales. When considering rezonage within that one-kilometre area it should be borne in mind that it takes in a fair slice of what is already developed. Some of the urban areas in my electorate, like Forster Tuncurry, Port Macquarie, the Camden Haven area and Harrington now would wholly and solely fall within that one-kilometre zone. So I suppose it is something we should be mindful of, but let us not lose sight of the fact&mdash;and I am not here defending the New South Wales government&mdash;that that policy does exist at the moment. It is incumbent on local government authorities to be aware of that. It is a key criterion. I know it is a key criterion in the local environment plan in the Manning and Great Lakes areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to the point I was making, if we are going to have a national policy on coastal development, my firm belief is that it must be implemented by state legislation. The states must maintain control of planning in these coastal areas. Whilever we believe in the federal system and conduct a federal system throughout the Commonwealth we must maintain the states' right to the planning controls over land use and not centralise that power here in Canberra, which is far more remote from the individual circumstances in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the third part of the motion of the honourable member for Paterson he talks about the consultative aspect in regard to national policy where the Commonwealth minister and state ministers can get together. He is talking about the ministers for the environment, but I think that should also include the ministers who have responsibility in the planning areas because they really go hand in hand. If we are going to establish environmental aspects of planning they must be implemented in conjunction with the planning department. Certainly my understanding is that in New South Wales state environmental planning policy is policed by the planning department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be not only environment ministers but also planning ministers involved in that consultative process. If they reach final agreement on a national policy, it should be implemented via state legislation, not Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The moratorium on all rezoning in subdivisions of land within one kilometre of the coast concerns me a little. In New South Wales, if there is an application for a parcel of land to be rezoned within that one kilometre coastal strip, then there has to be an environmental study attached to the rezoning application. In the planning process for these sorts of issues, where we say we are going to have a moratorium on development of subdivisions, we may lose sight of the fact that someone in the recent past may have purchased land with a reasonable expectation of being able to develop it on the basis of the way it is zoned today. To set an arbitrary date that eliminates the ability of that person who has invested probably quite a lot of money into that parcel of land because of the zoning is something that we have to examine very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has happened that local government bodies have implemented changes in planning policy and said, `Today is the day. You were there yesterday. Bad luck. You have dipped out to the tune of a couple of hundred thousand dollars. Tomorrow we start afresh.' That is not fair. We need to be very careful how that form of moratorium may be introduced. I tend to agree with a moratorium on rezoning, but certainly we need to be very careful in the case of the subdivision of land that has already been rezoned to a certain use. Not everybody can afford such a loss. They are not all big time developers with overseas connections. Quite often we are talking about people who may have taken a redundancy package from their long-time place of employment. They have invested in a small parcel of land in area that may be developed into a residential type development with no impact on the local area. We must be very careful that we do not discriminate against those people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, I make another reference to the former member for La Trobe, Mr Milton, who was the chairman of the House of Representatives  Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts when that committee started an inquiry into the coastal zone in 1989. I recall visiting many places. I know that report was handed down in 1991, but I am saddened to hear that very little has happened since. However, some things have happened, and I will mention them during my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to support this motion, which I am sure will create a controversy. However, I believe it should be supported to draw attention to the rapid degradation of our magnificent coastline. Our coast has been described very succinctly in the report of the coastal zone inquiry produced in November 1993. The overview said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coastal zone has a special place in the lives of Australians. Most Australians want to live there and if they can't they want to take their holidays there. It contains  diverse ecosystems and a high proportion of Australia's industrial activity occurs in the zone. It is a priceless national resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's coastal zone is more than a national asset. It is irreplaceable capital. We should strive to pass this capital on to the next generation undiminished. From it we ourselves derive the interest on which we live and depend. If our forebears had known what we know now, and had not squandered what they did, the returns to us today would be higher than they are. The strain in the coastal zone shows we are continuing to eat away at the capital, at precisely the time we need it most. What is worse, we have been too often unaware of doing it, until the consequences have become too obvious to miss, and the risks to our future impossible to ignore.</PARA>
<PARA>It is time for us to become aware. It is time for us to act before it is too late. The average growth rate of Australia's east coast strip in November 1993 was 1.9 per cent&mdash;almost double the national average of 1.1 per cent. Close to nine out of 10 Australians live in the zone, but since the 1970s there has been a profound shift in where they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost half of Australia's total population growth in the past two decades has been in the non-metropolitan coastal zone. This growth in the zone is far from fully understood. Economic development, an ageing population, growth in tourism and associated industry, as well as changing social values, clearly are important factors. So too are government policies affecting retirement income, social welfare and taxation. Policies promoting the decentralisation of industry must also be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Necessary data from the 1991 census, which would allow a detailed analysis of the causes of this mass migration away from the cities and towards the coast, is not yet available. The point is, however, that the trend is set to continue. That is the assessment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the period to the year 2005 at least. By comparison with what we have witnessed to date, the impact on towns, cities and the environment generally will be proportionately greater. By 2005 almost one million additional people probably will be living in the non-metropolitan coastal zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two factors are likely to impose particular strains. One is that the areas of greatest growth in the past are likely to continue to grow as strongly as before. These areas are principally in south-east and North Queensland, coastal New South Wales, south-east Melbourne and the areas immediately north and south of Perth. An almost uninterrupted ribbon of urbanisation is fast developing from the south coast of New South Wales right up to Hervey Bay, Queensland. The beginnings of a similar phenomenon are apparent in North Queensland. The Albert Shire, which links Brisbane to the Gold Coast, is the nation's fastest growing municipality. Since 1976 its annual population growth has averaged 11.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have collected just one or two examples of news items from the past few weeks which demonstrate the type of thing that is happening.

<PARA>This ad shows a point with four houses on it. There is absolutely no public access. This is the sort of thing that is happening all around our coast at the moment. In Frankston, where I come from, down in Flinders there are private beaches. The public is not allowed on them; they are owned by someone and no-one can get to them.

<PARA>This is the fear of local government. I believe local councils do not have the expertise to make the informed correct decisions about our coast. The coastal zone inquiry has proposed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the enactment of a Commonwealth Coastal Resource Management Act. This Act would incorporate the objectives and principles for coastal management agreed by the Commonwealth, by the States and by Local Government. By the very fact of its enactment, the Coastal Resource Management Act would underline the importance of the Coastal Zone in the scheme of national affairs, and give it due recognition.</PARA>
<PARA>It has proposed nine objectives: coastal zone resources should be available for fair and equitable public and commercial use; consequences arising from the highly dynamic nature of coastal environments should be recognised and acted upon; public access to the coast should be maintained; areas and features of significant ecological, physical, cultural, indigenous, historic, landscape and scientific importance should be conserved; the biological diversity of marine and terrestrial ecosystems should be maintained; the quality of coastal waters should be maintained; informed public participation should be ensured; indigenous interests in the coastal zone should be recognised and incorporated into management arrangements; and understanding of coastal zone ecosystems and natural processes and the effects on them of human activities should be enhanced. These are very worthy objectives and should be implemented as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fund the implementation of these objectives, taxes, levies, development fees and other financial instruments should be introduced to make certain that there is enough money to buy back privately owned coastal properties and rehabilitate that which is degraded. Already the objections are starting. This is part of a letter I have received:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you as a member of the Federal Government in relation to the recent recommendation from the Coastal Zone Inquiry to encourage State taxes on coastal hotels. This recommendation is ill-advised and will have extremely serious ramifications for the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that there are many meetings going on right now between state and federal governments to reach an agreed position regarding our coastal zone. Community groups, local, state and federal governments all have a responsibility to the people of our nation. Their duty is to obtain a decision with which we can all be satisfied, and that decision is the proper management of this priceless asset. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak to the motion of the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), for the thrust of the motion impacts significantly on my electorate of Stirling, which, for the record, encompasses the best beaches in the world. I have mixed feelings about this motion. On the one hand, there are coastal developments which I am not opposed to, and within my own electorate I point out the Observation City resort as an example of a positive development which has benefited the area. On the other hand, there are examples of development for development's sake, and again within my own electorate I point out the Trigg bushland as an example of where development was proposed but which was quite stupid and totally unnecessary. It is quite incomprehensible as to why it was thought of in the first place. I would like to expand on these two different examples&mdash;one a positive development, the other an unnecessary one&mdash;to illustrate the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Observation City resort is a major hotel complex on Scarborough beach, one of the most popular beaches in Western Australia and a retreat for many tourists within Western Australia, the eastern states and overseas. It has created many jobs within my electorate; it has earned tourist income for our state and many local businesses within my electorate. One of my only regrets is that the complex itself is foreign owned. Nonetheless, the development of Observation City was a definitely positive move and one that I have always been proud to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also add that there was a great suspicion surrounding the approval process with Observation City, and it was, of course, linked to the scandals of WA Inc. While it is regretted that the development was tainted by suggestions of corruption, wrongdoing and ill-conceived motives, my support for the development of Observation City is in-principle support. I would like it placed on the record that, whilst the somewhat dubious approvals which enabled the Bond Corporation to be granted the right to build Observation City should be questioned, the actual development itself has my support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also note that there were some concerns about the development with regard to the fact that Observation City interfered with television reception. That is more a planning fault than anything else and should have been overcome during the building of the resort, but the development should not have been opposed for that reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a speech made by Mr Ric Charlesworth, the former member for Perth, in 1991 on a report by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;of which I and the honourable member for Paterson are members&mdash;he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the committee when on one of its meetings&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">started off, of course, at Scarborough Beach. If one stands on the beach in Western Australia, one can look as far as one wants north or south and see beautiful white sands and lovely blue water. Unfortunately, the one thing that obscures one's vision is that monolith at Scarborough, Observation City, a testament to the forces of evil.</PARA>
<PARA>The former member never questioned the impact on the environment this development had, and I am not aware of any damage to the environment that it has caused&mdash;that is, I doubt that any damage occurred. It is certainly not an eyesore, though I understand it did disturb the views of some neighbours to the resort. This development, it should be noted, has enabled not just the people of Stirling but the people from the lesser states east of the Sandy Desert and tourists from overseas to enjoy and appreciate the beautiful white sands and lovely blue water referred to by Mr Charlesworth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To relate this development to the motion of the honourable member for Paterson, I would suggest it is not an indiscriminate development and that we should not assume that because one wishes to develop land on or near a beachfront it is environmental vandalism ensconced in scandal and should be opposed. We should provide serious consideration to all such developments and not write them off without any consideration. Nevertheless, I still sympathise with his motion and agree that we do need uniform policies which will maintain the precious environmental aspects of the coastal regions of our nation. We must safeguard these regions&mdash;indeed planning policies must consider the impact on the environment wherever development takes place whether it is on the coast or deep within our vast land mass&mdash;but we should not oppose all development under the guise of it being environmentally unfriendly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why a uniform policy is required, but I do not think that in the interim&mdash;until a policy is developed&mdash;a moratorium on the rezoning and subdivision of land within one kilometre of the coastline is a suitable action, particularly in view of the time it often takes for such decisions to be made. In this case it would require agreement between the environment ministers of all states plus, I would suggest, our planning ministers as well as local government ministers and then the cooperation of local government. In fact, this last point that coastal management needs to jointly involve federal, state and local government was&mdash;it has been pointed out to me&mdash;recently noted by Justice Stewart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in the interim, we do require responsible decision making and certainly not the rash develop-at-all-cost ideas that have permeated government authorities in different areas of the country, which have consequently devalued many beautiful areas of coastland. While development should be allowed it must proceed with caution and the second and third parts of this motion should allow for that, though, I repeat, I do not think that a moratorium is particularly necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned previously another area of my electorate, the Trigg beach bushland, which was proposed to be developed but thankfully commonsense has prevailed and the development has been abandoned. There is quite a difference between this and the Observation City development in that the Trigg development should have involved major site works, the destruction of considerable natural vegetation, and alteration to the natural dune landscape to create artificial depressions and so-called green spaces. Such environmental damage did not occur with the Observation City development. In fact, before Observation City there was an establishment in Scarborough right in that very area known as the snake pit, and that pretty much described the entire run-down beachfront area at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trigg bushland was a good idea which went over the top. There were some alterations which were probably necessary and would have been welcomed, such as an upgrade to the nearby car park and toilet facilities, coupled with a revegetation program. However, what eventually developed was a master plan which went well beyond the original proposals and would have been quite destructive to the local environment. These examples do show a need, as the motion of the honourable member for Paterson urges, for nationwide uniform environmental and planning policies. We certainly do not want another Gold Coast, which was an excessive abuse of our coastal region. However, the likes of Observation City and the Hillarys Marina, which is further north in the electorate of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), are worthy developments which I have no qualms about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking directly to the motion, I do not think there has been excessive and indiscriminate development in the coastal regions of Western Australia. I do agree with the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) when he said that we have to remain vigilant on this. I can agree that other parts of Australia have suffered from irresponsible decision making but a moratorium would not fix the problem; only the introduction of responsible planning and environmental policies would. As the motion indicates, it would be best if these laws were uniform across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am in total agreement with the second and third points of the motion. I respectfully suggest that our committee&mdash;that is, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;look further into coastal development policies and, in particular, the possibility of forming nationwide uniform environmental and planning policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I concur with the third point&mdash;that all environment ministers, state and federal, should meet as a matter of some urgency. I also suggest that we should include state planning and local government ministers, for they also have responsibility in this area. While I have reservations about some points of the motion, I certainly concur with the thrust of it and I commend the honourable member for Paterson for bringing this very important and topical issue to the attention of the House. This government accepted the report on our wounded coast in 1991. This report has already been referred to by the honourable member for Paterson, yet it has not been acted on.

<PARA>As an island nation, Australia is more dependent on shipping than most other nations for imports and exports. It is a scandal that so little of our trade is carried in Australian flagged and crewed vessels. Indeed, 96 per cent of our external trade is carried in foreign flag vessels. But it would be an even greater scandal if the Australian National Line were sold off. It would also be economic folly&mdash;economic folly because the world's fleet is ageing. People today are not building ships and, even if a start were made today, in eight to 10 years there would be a shortage of ships and trained personnel to work on these ships. Instead of talking about selling off Australian shipping, this House should be urging the building of more Australian ships. I give the commitment here that I will continue to work to ensure that the ANL is left intact and to have the shipping line Australian owned, Australian flagged, Australian crewed and under Australian regulations and award conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments have made very poor political decisions in regard to the ANL. The Hawke Labor government pledged a $100 million grant to recapitalise ANL in 1989. The money was to allow ANL to restructure and purchase new vessels. ANL had to enter into complex financial arrangements, including the sale of vessels to keep afloat when the government stopped the grant. The construction of one vessel, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">River Tamar</EMPHASIS>, began at Carrington Slipways in Newcastle. After the shipyard went into receivership, a further $10 million capital injection was promised to complete the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">River Tamar</EMPHASIS>, but it never eventuated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than a decade ago, the ANL was on its knees but the  government would not write off the debt. It decided to convert the loans to government equity in ANL. Since 1983 the Commonwealth has invested $100 million in ANL. In return, the employees and management have increased the net worth of the company by $450 million. Australian seafarers have been committed to ANL and industry reform. The Maritime Union of Australia helped make the line more efficient and viable. It did this to keep the national shipping industry afloat. It saw Australian crews reduced to below OECD levels, it has multiskilled and has been at the forefront of national reconstruction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL is extremely important because we Australians own it. The Australian people own it; it is our shipping line. Without an Australian National Line, we are in the hands of overseas interests. The asset sales task force is methodically stripping away our heritage, our wealth and, I believe, the control Australian people have over our economic future. It has sold viable enterprises to people whose only interest is self-interest, at great cost to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is selling off assets that give wealth back to the people. The task force consists of and is advised by economic rationalists. Privatisation looks good to them and opens up plenty of consultancy work for the advisers. Australia is left with the damage bill. ANL has 14 ships. It employs between 700 and 800 seafarers. The National Line covers the key world trades of Asia and Europe. It is Australia's largest employer in overseas trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ANL is privatised, the 14 ships will go as well as the 800 seafarers. We have to rebuild ANL. It is in our national interests to do so. In 1928, the Bruce government gave away our Commonwealth line for a song. It must not happen again. ANL provides important net balance of payments benefits that would be lost if it were taken over by a foreign shipping line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national interest requires that Australia maintains an adequate supply of shipping to keep the country going during times of national emergency, be they trade wars or military conflicts. We in Australia spend over $7 billion per year on the carriage of our imports and exports, with a net cost of $2 billion to the balance of payments. The sale of ANL would give away our seat at the conference tables around the world to foreign owned, multinational self-interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is at the end of the world shipping lines. The sale of ANL would effectively give away the control of these economic lifelines. ANL is a key player in the world shipping scene, protecting our economic rights. It provides important maritime skills, management and marketing expertise that would be lost with any sale to overseas interests. Australian National Line is the only international sea carrier that is based in Australia and is able to represent Australian export interests at meetings of international operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we sold off ANL, the other Australian owned shipping lines would also flag out. For example, if ANL were sold to overseas interests, the BHP fleet would obviously flag out. I suggest that we would get a situation where the BHP fleet could be owned by Hong Kong interests, registered in Cyprus and flying the Cypriot flag and have Greek officers with a mixed Burmese and Filipino crew. These well-maintained and well-crewed Australian ships would decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The motion also mentions cabotage, so I will talk a little about it. I was one of the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure who brought down the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. That report highlighted the condition of many ships coming into Australia. Yet these are the very ships that the vested interests who push for cabotage to be lifted want on Australian waters. Not only are these ships an international disgrace; they are a danger to the coastline of Australia. A number of them have become coffin ships to significant numbers of seafarers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what some honourable members opposite claim, there have been extensive and successful reforms to shipping and the waterfront in Australia in recent years. When those vocal claims for the removal of cabotage are made, we should look very hard at the calls by the vested interests, such as the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the International Bulk Commodities Group for the relaxation of cabotage and the turning over to foreign flagged vessels of the sea link in our domestic transport chain. If this massive distortion of our economic transport chain were to occur, it would destroy forever the chance we may now have, slim though it might be, to build a truly domestic transport system. But this does not worry those who want to make a short-term quick buck. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only difference now between Australian shipping and our foreign competitors is that many operate under flags of convenience from havens denied to Australians. Often their crews do not pay tax. If that handicap were removed by properly structuring the fiscal circumstances of the Australian shipping industry, Australian shipping would then be seen in its true light as an effective and internationally competitive activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Australian flagged ships are of a high standard. I believe that our reputation has been enhanced by the recommendations of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, the majority, but not all, of which have been accepted by the government. But what will happen to that reputation if we sell our fleet? In my view, it is essential that we maintain ANL as an Australian owned, Australian flagged and Australian crewed shipping line where people are employed under Australian standards and conditions. I make no apology for saying that. I will fight with all my ability to see that this is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we prepared to put the future of our trade in the hands of foreign shipping interests? Make no mistake: if we sell off ANL, this is what we will be doing. As I said before, instead of talking about selling off ANL, we should be talking about investing in more Australian ships. If we are really serious about protecting the Australian maritime environment, there would be no talk of selling off ANL. We are more likely to be able to protect our environment if we are dealing with our own registered, flagged and crewed ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During recent years I have personally inspected much of the substandard shipping detained around Australia. Anyone who doubts the condition under which these ships sail, the condition of the ships and the condition of the crew, ought to have a look at some of these ships. Some of these conditions were highlighted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report. The crews had to work under appalling conditions. They received starvation wages or sometimes no wages at all. There was a lack of food and the crews suffered physical and sexual abuse. People in ports such as Newcastle and Port Kembla will repeat these stories. If people doubt it at all, they should talk to the chaplains from the Missions of the Seamen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My preference is for all of ANL to remain in public ownership. I do not see what this craze is to sell off everything which is under public ownership. I am an old-style socialist who believes in public ownership; I make no apology for that. A minimum should be an ANL, with majority Australian ownership and with Australian flagged and Australian crewed vessels. It should operate under Australian awards. The main operations must be in Australia. There must be a majority of Australian directors, and there must be an Australian chairperson. I am all for keeping ANL as it is&mdash;100 per cent Australian owned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Towards the end of his speech the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) outlined the reason for bringing this motion before the House. As he said, he is an old-time socialist and he believes in government ownership of various entities throughout the community. That is what the real basis of this motion is. There is a debate within the government about privatising ANL, and the honourable member prefers to see the Australian national shipping line remain wholly owned, 100 per cent owned, by the government. The honourable member's motion is, no doubt, really about preselection and getting support from the correct unions within his electorate. We need to be aware of the basic reason for this motion coming before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that aside, the first part of the motion states that this House supports majority Australian ownership of the Australian National Line. I notice that the honourable member for Throsby does not want 51 per cent Australian ownership, but 100 per cent. That is his basic starting point. That is part of the platform of the left wing faction of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is very supportive of Australians owning shipping lines around Australia&mdash;not just one, hopefully several. It would be good if we had competitive Australian shipping companies which are able to make a real go of it. The motion moved by the honourable member for Throsby belongs to a different era. It is an archaic way to approach shipping in this country. It goes back to the debates of the 1960s, maybe the 1950s, about how Australia should interact with the world. The fact is that we now operate in a global world community, particularly with regard to shipping. The essence of this motion is to have an Australian national line, irrespective of how good it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am fully supportive of ANL being a shipping line if it is competitive and if it operates effectively. But, as the honourable member for Throsby illustrated, the government has had to pump $100 million into this operation over the last 10 years to keep it afloat. Does that really mean that we have got a shipping line which is competitive and effective? I think that is very questionable. Hopefully, ANL is now competitive. I hope and certainly desire that it is a competitive shipping line. In some respects it is. To argue in this House today that we should maintain 100 per cent ownership of the shipping line, irrespective of how good it is in its operation, is archaic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member is saying `hands off' in regard to overseas interests. What about hands off in other areas, if that is what he wants to do? But that is not the world in which we as Australians any longer live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are totally interconnected with other communities and other operations around the world. As with environmental matters in this country, we live in a global and economic community. We cannot just shut our eyes to the competitive influences which are now operating in the world in this area. Let us take a positive approach on this matter. Let us have more than one shipping line which is totally Australian owned. For example, Brambles is a company which owns shipping. I would hope that a company like that, owned by Australians, could become a large shipping line around the world. Let us have other shipping lines developed; there are lots of other small operators around. We should not have a head in the sand approach that only one Australian national shipping line can be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having a more effective shipping line in Australia is not the only issue we should be addressing; we should also be addressing waterfront reform. This was touched on briefly by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby. I would like to illustrate in this debate some lack of coherency in this area in government policy. The government talks about improvements in waterfront reform, which has been done largely through deregulating and changing what has been there in the past. I think it has brought about some real improvements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own port of Burnie, Tasmania, the fifth largest container port in Australia, there have been some considerable improvements. Those improvements, though, have come about not by hanging on to past archaic ideas on how to do it but by moving forward. Just to illustrate, for example: all the waterside workers on the Burnie wharf are employed by the Burnie Port Authority. That authority also owns the Burnie Wynyard airport. If a ship is not in port at the time, those workers will also go out, if required, to the Burnie airport and do work out there. If there is work in the office to be done by the Burnie Port Authority, the people who work on the wharves will also go there. There is no idle time any longer. As many in this country would know, there was a time when there was a lot of idle time on our wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in the waterfront area have made the transport industry more competitive. With shipping, we have the idea that we can hang on to and keep a company as a national, government owned company and if it does not trade properly keep pouring money into it. That is not the way in which Australia will get exports moving around this country nor to other countries overseas. There is a lack of coherency between waterfront reform and the motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Throsby on shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government talks about having a flat playing field so that we can compete on an equal basis. I would agree with that: let us have our shipping compete on an equal basis. Let us make sure that overseas lines do not come in here with their shipping being subsidised and so undermining our shipping lines. I agree with that. However, the government has to make sure that the cost structures of shipping are not increased disproportionately with those of overseas shipping. For example, in the last budget the government increased excise by 3c a litre. That put up the cost of transporting of ships by $288,000 per vessel per year just by adding to the fuel costs. What did that mean? It meant that fuel costs for Australia's nearest shipping line competitors was 43 per cent higher and 70 per cent higher when compared with the world's best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, we cannot have government members coming in here and saying, `Let's keep our shipping line and have a flat playing field' and, on the other hand, saying, `Let's increase excise on fuel for our shipping.' I think all of us in Australia recognise that as a nation we have to be competitive. Our shipping lines also have to be competitive. I would welcome having ANL remain as it is, if it is truly competitive. But from time to time we see that that is not necessarily the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion assumes that the government can pick winners. Why should ANL be better than any other Australian owned company operating in Australian waters? I do not believe that governments should be in the business of picking winners. What we should be doing is encouraging as many different people as possible to own ships around the Australian coastline, and to be competitive, aggressive and effective operators. This country, being an island continent, certainly needs access to shipping lanes around the world. It would be good if we controlled a lot of companies that had shipping interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in regard to cabotage, the previous speaker mentioned that it brought in the idea of safety&mdash;that Australia can control ships that come into Australian waters. That is the way in which we should operate. We should be exercising control. There is no reason why we should allow ships to operate within our waters without due safety provisions. As for cabotage, which enables us to keep other ships out and keep our own ships for intrastate shipping and so forth, I do not think this is the way in which Australia can go. I do not think we can hide our heads in the sand in this area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite surprised by the ignorance shown by certain people on the other side. It has been suggested that the proposition put by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) is archaic. It may be timely in the sense that it has some historical background and maybe we ought to go through that, but before we do, I would point out that the other day a question was asked of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) about the level of foreign aid given by this country. In his reply, the Minister for Finance suggested that one of our problems in delivering foreign aid and delivering it within our budget requirements is that only 38 per cent of our GDP is in public ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He quite rightly pointed to Sweden&mdash;a Scandinavian country&mdash;which has 72 per cent of its GDP in public ownership. He talked about the foreign aid that it can give and the dollars and cents that it can throw at projects. It has no difficulty finding these dollars and cents because a high level of its GDP is in public ownership. So before people on the other side start talking about the fact that it is wrong or archaic for Australia to have public ownership of resources, I think they should look at the 1990s and the Scandinavian countries which are doing quite well with high levels of public ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the realities. The first national line was set up in World War I. It was set up because there was a strategic need for this country to recognise that we are a big island, that nothing comes into or out of Australia in great quantities unless it is by sea. I would have thought that those on the other side had realised that. Obviously, they have not. In a military sense, strategically it is ideal for the Australian government to have some control over movements into and out of our own ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of trade, it was recognised back then that we did need to have a national carrier, someone who could protect the interests, not just of one or two rich companies, but of all Australians. That is why it was established. The honourable member for Throsby mentioned the demise of that first Australian national line during the term of the Bruce-Page government. Let us look at why the Bruce-Page government got rid of that national line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lo and behold, Prime Minister Bruce had vast connections with P&amp;O! He had a great deal of trouble with the wharf unions when he could not get some of his goods on to the Christmas market. It is historically documented. Therefore, he pressed for those workers on the docks and our seamen to be forced under. The only way he could do that was by selling out our national line. He did so at a pittance. It took many years for us again to be in a position to have a national line, which we now have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that Australia has not moved. We happen to be exactly where we were in 1917. The water between us and Hong Kong is just as vast. The continents may have moved a millimetre, but it is nothing which will affect our position in terms of access to world markets and the ability to get vast quantities of our goods out and other goods in. Therefore, strategically in terms of trade all of the things that were mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby&mdash;being able to be involved in international shipping boards and keeping on the pulse of what is going on&mdash;are integral to our having a national line. They would be reasons enough, but there are more reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby described himself as a socialist. I also put my hand up. I do not in any way suggest that this is a dirty word. What does it mean to me? It means that I care about ordinary Australian people. I think there are some things which all of us should own. All of us should benefit from the minerals under the ground, not just foreigners or outside companies. We should all benefit from health and education. That is what socialism is about. It is not about knocking out people's ability to set up companies and go forward. It is about saying that there are certain things that all of us should benefit from. I will never resile from that. We need health, we need education and we need roofs over our heads. These things should be financed paid for by things which are collectively owned by all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will never sit in this country and be happy if what has happened in Britain happens here. Britain has tried to privatise the water, for God's sake! So if someone cannot get a drink and does not have enough bucks, that person is supposed to die. These are the ideas of unbridled capitalism, along with the idea that people can be used to the extent that they are some sort of fodder or unit. That is an archaic idea. That is the idea that should be taken out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that there is a world crisis in shipping. Anyone who took five minutes to find out about it, instead of standing up waffling on while knowing absolutely nothing about shipping, would know that $400 billion, if spent today, would not be enough. Australians in our gallery now do not realise! How are we going to have a push of exports to Asia if we do not have ships? The world fleet is on average 18 years of age. The recommended maximum age of a ship is 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby talked about those rust buckets in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. They take the majority of the world's cargo. The honourable member for Throsby and I are concerned about the seamen they take with them when they hit the bottom. That is not to mention our concern about those rust buckets going over our reef. How will Australians feel when half-rusted-out oil tankers coming down here end up on our reefs? What sorts of costs will we bear then?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the shipping crisis is not addressed, we as an island nation are in deep trouble. We need to export to Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hilmer has indicated in public debates all over this country that competition policy does not give efficiency or equity in the allocation of resources. All we have to do to know that is look at Optus and Telecom. There are two sets of lines going side by side. Does that give us any more services? No, it does not. When I try to use a mobile phone in my electorate, I cannot get through. Resources would be allocated if we had efficient public-ownership and no privatisation. </PARA>

Would people like to be in that position again? I for one would not. I for one believe that we need to keep the core of the industry that we have on board. It is from that core that we can build a sustainable and long-term shipping industry. Of all the places in the world, this country needs it more than most.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I do not think many people realise the importance of the maritime industry to Australia: it is an $8 billion industry. It is therefore important that, before we progress any further, we come to a proper understanding of where the maritime industry is going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I am happy to speak in this debate on the motion of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). I wish to speak on some of the peripheral matters that should be determined within this debate, such as the government ownership of the Australian National Line. I also refer to the pool of maritime labour which is under union control and the maintenance of cabotage on our Australian shipping coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the first to acknowledge that, over the last 10 years, the image of the maritime unions has dramatically changed in Australia. There have been great improvements in workplace practices, ship manning levels, demarcation issues and many other conditions which in the past made the Australian shipping industry so uncompetitive and which, unfortunately, allowed Australia to drag well behind the rest of the world when it came to international shipping. As I understand it, improvements in work practices alone resulted in $217,000 per vessel being saved on that last round. When looking at our industrial situation compared with that of the rest of the world, I believe these costs are now below OECD levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I maintain that, in order to become internationally competitive, much more has to be done. Shipowners cannot get these productivity gains, which the government is seeking under enterprise bargaining, while the union has this pool of labour which it allocates to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I wish to address the issue of Australian ownership. The only problem with ANL retaining its government ownership is that, as has been said, it almost has a conflict of interest; the owners of the line are the people responsible as a government for trying to provide the industrial framework to make the Australian shipping industry provide for itself. The opposition would love the ownership of the line to remain in Australian hands. But, when it comes to asking where that capital is coming from, one wonders whether those savings are available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in the white paper prepared by the government that the airports are up for sale. Qantas is on a public float. The question is: where does one find the capital? As I said before, there has to be a change from government ownership. I wonder how the first item of the motion of the honourable member for Throsby will come into effect if we expect the majority of Australian ownership to come from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a recent example of the shortage of capital in Australia. Two abattoirs which were owned formally by Borthwicks in the Mackay and Bowen areas in my electorate were sold to Australian Meat Holdings. It was forced to sell because of a monopoly in the marketplace. It could not attract 100 per cent of Australian buyers in the first place. As I understand it, the price was as little as $30 million for the two of them. Eventually, Mackay Sugar took a 30 per cent interest, and a Japanese interest took 70 per cent. I understand that as of the last month or so it is completely Japanese owned&mdash;foreign owned&mdash;and there has been no FIRB inquiry. In the light of this, one has to wonder where that capital has come from, particularly when we know an expanding foreign debt has to be serviced and our superannuation funds are apparently closed to such investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn my attention to the matter of union crewing of ships. I think this is a vital case. There is no doubt that, while there is union crewing of ships, it has a capacity to add costs. The transfer of those crews from one port to another, travel expenses and things like that add considerably to shipping costs. There is no chance of enterprise bargaining while the companies themselves, while not employing that labour, are removed from that direct employment. In this regard, I believe it is the only industry in Australia that exercises such an archaic practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second case is the Coal Industry Tribunal, which is isolationist in what it does. In the famous white paper of last week, I genuinely support this statement on page 40:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Negotiations on company employment in our shipping industry are being undertaken under the auspices of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>I give wholehearted endorsement to that. I ask, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether you, as the mover of this motion, approve of that statement, as you no doubt approve of the sale of the airports of the FAC to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is very important that crews are controlled by the shipping companies, particularly if we want a great Australian shipping industry&mdash;one that can have direct contact with the ship owners to get real productivity from enterprise bargaining. I think it is all the more important, particularly when the people who are paying the bills at the moment and are trying to meet international competition are not the ones who employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the final matter of cabotage. I believe the honourable member for Throsby has said on previous occasions that cabotage is the safety net for the industry. I do not believe it is. I think the safety net for the industry is the manner in which the Australian government controls and regulates the Navigational Act on maritime safety. It depends on those people as to whether we have a safe industry or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week we were debating in this chamber matters that referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> report, the Navigation Act and other incidents. This argument depends on how international bodies can become operative in ensuring the safety of these ships. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), talked about rust buckets. The international recommended standard is a vessel no older than 16 years. The average age of ships now is about 18 years. I think it is very important that we implement international maritime law to make shipping safe, and cabotage is not the only issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue that is not addressed by this&mdash;it surprises me&mdash;is how government charges and taxes influence the viability of our own Australian shipping industry. Bearing in mind that 94 per cent of international shipping in and out of Australia is done by international companies and not by Australian companies, one has to look at the reason why our own companies are not competing. We can look at the recent increase in the excise on fuel, which I understand raised the price of fuel by some 55 per cent. The additional cost per vessel operating in Australian waters is $288,000, which far offsets the $217,000 per vessel gained from the last round of industrial negotiations. The shipping fuel costs are now 43 per cent higher than our nearest competitor and are nearly 70 per cent higher than world best practice. How can we become internationally competitive with those costs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also look at the additional costs of labour in Australia&mdash;which is ours alone&mdash;through payroll tax, the superannuation guarantee levy and the fringe benefits tax. They are greater than any of our competitors. These are the things that we must address if we are to bring Australia back to a competitive edge&mdash;not cabotage, the ownership issue or industrial awards. This factor is torpedoing our shipping lines at the moment. How they can survive in the light of this is a major problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to draw to the attention of honourable members an anomaly in the family payment scheme, an anomaly that is sexist and highly discriminatory. I have a case of a constituent who is being discriminated against because of his sex. He is the father of a three-year-old and he has custody of his child. He is therefore eligible for a sole parent benefit. But the Department of Social Security will not pay the benefit to him. Why? Because under section 831(2) of the act, the payment must go to the female in any relationship, even though in this case the female is clearly not the custodial parent. The money has to be paid to the woman with whom he is living&mdash;he has recently formed a relationship&mdash;even though the child is clearly being looked after by the father and the female in this relationship has no children of her own. Still, the family payment is being given to the female and not the father.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. On Friday, I had the opportunity to visit Warrnambool and meet with something like seven regional boards representing subregions within the western district of Melbourne. The response to the previous day's statement on industry and regional development was very positive. What was positive is a recognition that, while the initiatives in terms of regional development were regarded as modest and certainly not as a big spend, they came and were welcomed because they provided the opportunity to build on initiatives and ideas that are being developed in that part of Victoria and that region of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the white paper indicated is not some intention to drop proposals or dollars all round the country but an intention to work with regions to ensure that over time the very best ideas and the most creative proposals are picked up. Those creative proposals will enable regions of Australia to become increasingly competitive, building around their strengths. As honourable members opposite know, one of the strengths of that western district of Melbourne clearly is the port of Portland. One example mentioned in discussion as part of those consultations was the potential for the further development of the port.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is not that the government had not already taken some initiative as part of a small program called the SLEC program&mdash;strengthening local economic capacity. A small amount of money has been made available to the city of Portland to work on the potential for developing that port for an export industry. This week, leaders of that city are in China, following up a previous visit from Chinese leaders from Henan about the possibilities of building links between those ports and developing exports and an exchange of activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of proposals were put forward by various leaders, one of which was the development of a multi-million dollar krill fishing industry as a potential growth industry out of that port. The development and the associated infrastructure clearly would require, and would receive, very substantial local support. Talks have indicated the possibility of further support from private industry. The state government and the Commonwealth government might both be involved in the development of that kind of proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of regional Australia, no-one is suggesting that what should be developed should be developed anywhere else but in those regions. No matter whether it is in Victoria, North Queensland or regions in other parts of Australia, I think the leadership recognises that what is needed is an approach which develops a partnership with government and which provides a framework for the private sector that can mean not only new industry but also new jobs and an often unrealised potential in terms of the industries and the characteristics of a particular region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement has been well received not only there but around Australia. It is an approach which is intelligent, which builds on local creativity and which provides opportunities for partnership. Whether it is in the infrastructure fund, the $70 million fund announced in the paper, whether it is through infrastructure bonds where superannuation funds and private investment can feed into infrastructure or whether it is the pool development funds, which will mean that small business in many areas will have the opportunity to receive investment and to pick up developments that will lead to further employment, the reaction to the statement has been very positive. I noticed in a very representative series of meetings on Friday that people involved in regional development saw the government's statement as being very much in the right direction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exaggerating? We are already at four per cent, or have you not heard? Can you not read a set of national accounts? We are already at four per cent for the year. When we look at the fundamentals in the economy, compared with the recent past when we grew at an average of 4 1/2 per cent between 1983 and 1990, we see a much more competitive economy, much more competitive product markets with lower tariffs, a much more enhanced productivity culture in the economy, a much more flexible labour market, low inflation, low interest rates, a high profit share and a 33 per cent tax rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="443" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The reforms to social security announced in the white paper are a major overhaul of the social security system. The central objective of these changes is to achieve a situation where, irrespective of unemployed people's circumstances&mdash;whether they are single, members of a couple with or without children&mdash;unambiguously they benefit from increasing their work effort. That is the central objective of those changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have been broadly welcomed across the board. Robert Fitzgerald, President of ACOSS, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberalisation of the income tests on unemployment benefits and the introduction of the parenting allowances were a tremendous boost to low income earners.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in the light of some of the things the opposition has been saying. This is what people who actually work with low income people have had to say. David Cappo, National Director of the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major reform of the social security system centres on the introduction of new income test arrangements which recognise the increasing participation of women in the labour market. These arrangements are overdue and will provide much needed incentives and greater flexibility for individuals and couples wishing to increase earnings through casual and part-time employment.</PARA>
<PARA>Bishop Michael Challen, Executive Director of the Brotherhood of St Laurence, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has been bold . . . changes to unemployment allowances should encourage people to take up more part time and casual work . . . significant assistance to low income families.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a set of changes which has been broadly welcomed. The parenting allowance, in particular, is a major element in those changes. What it means is that, in many existing situations where there is a couple with dependent children and one member of that couple is offered a low paid full-time job, that family can often end up worse off in financial terms by taking up that opportunity. This change changes that situation fundamentally. It also means that low income families have a more realistic choice as to whether they want one of the couple to stay home and engage in full-time parenting activities. It does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is contrary to the suggestions of some journalists, including Glenn Milne, in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He asserts that the economic and social effect of the parenting allowance and income splitting are the same. That, of course, is an utter absurdity. There is a range of important differences both in the overall philosophy and the effect of our parenting allowance and the income splitting changes favoured by the opposition. Glenn Milne only referred to one aspect; that is, the parenting allowance goes directly to the carer whereas income splitting benefits the primary taxpayer. But that is just one, and not really the most significant, of the changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other massive differences conceptually in introducing a parenting allowance, which is up to $132 a week, and which will benefit 118,000 low income families on average to the tune of $59 a week. It is a major redistributive measure as well as anything else, as well as helping to overcome these work force disincentives. Where it contrasts with income splitting is that income splitting is fundamentally regressive. Greater benefits go to people on high incomes and people at the bottom end of the scale actually lose under income splitting. That is one huge difference. Our parenting allowance is a highly targeted payment which is directed towards low income families specifically. The other major difference is in the impact on incentives to participation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at this, we have to look at the totality of what we are doing here. As well as introducing the parenting allowance, we have decided to separately income test the two partners of a married couple. What that means is that, unlike the present situation where, say, we have a married couple where one of the partners does a day or two of part-time work and earns a bit of income, if the second partner is contemplating taking up a part-time work opportunity, they face a $25 free area. Once they have earned that first $25, they go straight into a 100 per cent withdrawal rate&mdash;a massive disincentive to taking up significant work effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our new scheme they will be income tested separately so that the spouse in that circumstance would have a $30 free area, followed by a 50 per cent withdrawal rate for the next $40, followed by a 70 per cent withdrawal rate thereafter&mdash;a far more liberal and favourable situation. If we contrast that with the impact of income splitting, we see that the effect of income splitting is to ensure that a second earner contemplating entering the work force has to encounter a higher marginal tax rate because of the effect of income splitting; in other words, he or she faces a major additional deterrent to participation in work.</PARA>

Does the Prime Minister expect Australians to believe that there will be no increases over the next 12 to 18 months in interest rates and that everybody in the market is wrong and he is always right?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oh dear! Yesterday I took the opportunity to explain the point about the long-term bond rate and the bond market. That was that interest rates in the long-term bond market were well into the teens in 1990-91 and cash rates were at 18 per cent and today they are at 4.75 per cent. Under the government's policy, we have reduced interest rates by roughly one percentage point intermittently from 18 per cent down to 4.75 per cent. Honourable members opposite should know that when interest rates rise there is capital profits for bond holders. The Australian bond market has been amongst the most strongly performing over the last couple of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened is that bond holders with many bonds, knowing that the capital profits game is finished and looking at international trends in bond prices and bond yields and the prospects for inflation&mdash;after the United States Federal Reserve Bank increased its short-term interest rates in the face of what it thought may be some pressure on inflation&mdash;long bond holders in the United States, started to sell their bonds; and when you sell a bond, when you walk out of it, the yield rises. So the yields rose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here, as I said last week, the Australian bond holders in the bond market sold too&mdash;so the yields went up&mdash;simply because the profits game was over, and they were not going to sit there apparently for the long haul taking the coupon. They wanted to get out and get into equities or something else. That has driven up the yield. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the white paper or the budget. If you think that, you guys must have lived under a rock for most of your lives. That is simply the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the questioner that cash rates are still at 4.75 per cent. We in this country have succeeded in getting inflation down to around two per cent on the basis of much restraint on the part of the work force and good sense on the part of employers in not pushing price increases. As a consequence, we have a number of policy instruments to deal with inflation, and the accord and the commitment on inflation no greater than our trading partners' average are important ones amongst them. So, too, is monetary policy. It always will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion that what has happened to long-term bond rates is in some way a judgment about Australian economic conditions and policy is basically fanciful. The judgment is that interest rates are not going lower; therefore, there are no more short-term profits to be had. So those who have basically a bellyful of bonds have decided to sell some. In doing so, in all hopping out at once, which is the essence of the market&mdash;getting in first and being first out&mdash;the yields went up. If those opposite do not understand that simple point, I do not think I can drive any other thoughts through their minds.</PARA>

I was delighted, for instance, that organisations like the Metal Trades Industry Association described the white paper as a constructive contribution to public policy. The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures said that a helping hand for the long-term unemployed had been extended in the government white paper and it is also in the best interests of industry. Mr John Morrison of Holden's said that the white paper would boost confidence and help us develop long-term employment opportunities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, those in the business community&mdash;as distinct from the financial markets, about which much was written&mdash;the people who actually run businesses and employ people, have in terms of their organisational wings come out very strongly in support of the white paper. They have because they know that there has to be a complement to skills formation in this recovery and they know that a society which is divided into those in work and those out of work, in the end, is bad for business and bad for the long-term cohesion of the country. It is a great tragedy that this is not known on the other side of public life in this country. We have had the smokescreen from those saying, `Well, the long-term unemployed will only displace jobs of people of shorter term duration in unemployment,' or the other notion that the only way to create jobs is to cut wages and debase conditions.</PARA>

Can the minister confirm that over 200,000 people will now be moved out of the unemployment statistics in this way, despite the fact that they do not really have jobs?

The decision that I announced on Friday for an adult training wage is a major breakthrough in helping solve the unemployment problem in this country. It is a breakthrough that has been arrived at with the trade union movement. This afternoon I will be going to its executive meeting to conclude negotiations in relation to the youth wages. But it has been suggested, as the honourable member's question indicates, that this somehow is a borrow of the policies of the opposition. Let me just remind the House what Fightback mark 1 had to say in relation to Austrain. It said that the scheme allows participants to be employed on training wage rates which would vary depending upon the amount of time out of work. After six months unemployment an employer will be able to offer a job at 90 per cent of the award wage or other equivalent minimum and, after 12 months unemployment, 80 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

But the point I am trying to make is that your policy bears no resemblance at all to what we have been negotiating with the ACTU. As a great concession for getting adults back into the work force, apart from that 90 per cent, 80 per cent, discount, their next great hit was to reduce it to 70 per cent for the long-term unemployed. There was no reference to training, except once a person got to 45 years of age. The only training guarantee under your Austrain proposal would apply to youth in qualifying circumstances and those over the age of 45. I am advised by my department that in relation to the long-term unemployed some 60 per cent of people would miss out as a result of that in terms of genuine training. The only way they would be able to get a job is to front up with a stigmatised wage and say, `This is what has to get me back to work.' In the same document, the opposition said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Austrain gives the long-term unemployed the opportunity to find their own on-the-job training.</PARA>

He quoted a section from the Fightback document to say that `a person who has been in receipt of JSA and Newstart for 12 months or more will have access to a voucher'. What Mr Milne failed to include as the preamble to that section was these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second category of training vouchers will be made available to the long-term unemployed, i.e. those who have been unemployed for 12 months or more over the age of 45 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Your commitment was not genuine. Your commitment was to reduce the wages and reduce them more, depending on the length of time that people had been out of work. It was not a commitment to genuine training. Ours is a position that gives incentive to train, combines the subsidy with it, has the commitment to the training wage and to genuine accredited training. That is why it has got community support, whereas your divisive, punitive approach was rejected&mdash;and it ought to have been.</PARA>

Are you aware that, including the artificially subsidised jobs funded by your department, two million new jobs between now and 30 June 2000 mean more than 890 net jobs created every day between now and then? I remind you that the green paper argues that the five per cent unemployment target requires sustained growth of about 4 3/4 per cent, which has not been achieved for a consecutive six-year period since the late 1960s. Given this basic fact and Access Economics' predictions last week of growth falling to 3 1/2 per cent in 1995-96 and three per cent in 1996-97, what confidence can any reasonable person have that the government is capable of even approaching the five per cent figure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for her question and acknowledge her very keen interest and hard work on behalf of Defence Force members and their families. This government has always recognised that support for families in the total work force concept is very important, and no more so than in the case of the ADF. Defence Force families face particular difficulties, given the forced mobility and the lifestyle effects that are required of them due to military service. The need for a review of family services was given a great stimulus earlier this year with the release by my predecessor, Senator John Faulkner, of the Defence Force families' mobility and dislocation study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While finding that ADF families were generally happy with their lot, he did have a number of specific recommendations, one of which was that a review of family support services for the ADF should be provided. Accordingly, I announced earlier today that such a review headed by Ms Valerie Pratt&mdash;who may be known to members of the House as a former head of the Affirmative Action Agency and a past member of the Defence Housing Authority Board&mdash;will take place and will report within six months. The aim of the review is to look at ways of making the wide range of family support services that are available to Defence Force families, such as family support funding, child care, information services and so on, more effective and more efficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is nearly 10 years since such a review was undertaken, and I do not need to remind the House that during that time much has changed in the defence force organisation&mdash;the ADF in particular&mdash;and in its deployment, not to mention societal values as a whole. The review will consult widely with service personnel and importantly with their families, including through the National Consultative Group of Service Families, which is a very active and worthwhile organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, a lot of good work has been done for Defence Force families in the last few years, and I think the other side of the House would acknowledge that with some level of bipartisan support. I would think that would be particularly the case in things such as defence housing. I look forward to this review of family support services for ADF and family members, to work on that good work and to build on it, particularly in this, the International Year of the Family.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his question and his particular interest in the question of a new airport for Sydney's west. I will be relatively brief. I can confirm that in the white paper we agreed to the accelerated development of a major runway at Badgerys Creek that is capable of handling large aircraft both taking off and landing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now proposed that that 2,900 metre runway be commissioned by 1998-99. It is a real runway, not a pretend runway. We see it as an essential catalyst for the future private sector investment in the airport, the associated airport services and the terminal facilities that are necessary for the establishment of regular public transport operations there. In addition to the airport, we have also set up a task force to make sure that the necessary planning is undertaken for an early expressway link and the reservation of a rail corridor so as to meet future demand for transport between Badgerys Creek and Sydney airport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The major beneficiaries of these developments are the people of western Sydney, who have direct access to the airport facilities years earlier than had been originally proposed. There will be a significant direct and indirect employment opportunity available in western Sydney and the Macarthur region flowing out of these works. The establishment of a major airport is also likely to attract other industries to the region, again with consequent employment opportunities for western Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, the establishment of this airport has also been strongly supported by residents living in Sydney's inner suburbs. Those residents have long called for the acceleration of the second Sydney airport in the knowledge that its development will protect them from the further erosion of the existing night curfew at Kingsford Smith. Our decision accordingly results in a win-win situation for the people of inner Sydney and the western regions of Sydney.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of certain electors of the Division of Parkes, (Broken Hill, N.S.W.), point out to the House the fact that, parents are unable to claim as dependents any child who is 16 years-of-age or over as a tax deduction on their taxation return. At the age of 18, the youth of Australia are considered adults and therefore eligible to lodge a voting preference, and are considered responsible enough to get married and take on adult responsibilities. But for the Tertiary Student to be defined under the status of `Independent Student' for Austudy purposes they must fit into one of the following categories:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have been previously granted independent status by Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are 23 years-of-age or over.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are married or have been married.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are or have been in a de facto relationship and there is a dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have or had a dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Been supporting themself by working or getting a pension, benefit or allowance.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are an orphan, a refugee, or homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We the electors also point out to the House the fact that many of today's youth are starting their tertiary education soon after the completion of their secondary education, at the age of 19. The migration from secondary to tertiary studies at this age, is due to the fact of the unemployment situation they would be facing if they decided to delay their tertiary studies. Many of these students come from country areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the geographical isolation that young adults from country areas face when undertaking full-time tertiary studies, an extra financial burden is placed on the parents of such students. Many of these parents are able to only obtain, or are employed in part-time positions, due to the unemployment situation that most country areas are experiencing today. Therefore there is a need for them to seek a second job or for both parents to gain employment to keep up with their financial commitments and to also assist with their child's (young adult's) educational expenses. Without this extra income many of these young adults would not be able to pursue their tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By being defined as dependent tertiary students, at the present age definition of dependency, on the away-from-home rate of payment, as outlined by the Austudy system of classification ie under 23 years of age, this therefore means that the student's allowance is assessed on the combined income and assets of both parents. In many cases the extra income puts the adjusted family income well above the minimum, but not above the maximum income at which Austudy remains payable. "The priorities of Austudy are to encourage young people to stay in education and to provide assistance to those who wish to gain an initial post-secondary qualification" (p.19 `Austudy Information Booklet', 1989). With the more realistic 19-years-of-age limit consideration of independent status for tertiary students on the away-from-home rate of payment, Austudy would be fulfilling one of their priorities to the isolated tertiary student and encourage them to remain in the education system by assisting them to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We the petitioners also point out to the House, that not only in Broken Hill, but in other areas of the state the unemployed youth at the age of 18 to 20 years-of-age, whether they live at home or in rental accommodation (shared or low rental), have the same living expenses almost identical in terms of: clothing themselves, paying accommodation costs, and recreational needs. Therefore there should be an equality in the rate payable to the youth on the Job Search allowance for this age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore ask the House to take action in having the age limit as considered by Austudy, for single tertiary students, who are receiving the away-from-home rate of payment, eligibility for independent status, lowered from the present 23 years-of-age to 19 years-of-age. We your petitioners also ask the House to take action in bringing about the equality in the rate of payment for the unemployed 18 to 20 year old youth of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday afternoon, 6 May, I attended a most moving ceremony in the Bundaberg botanical gardens. Some 500 Bundaberg residents and visitors, including 150 who flew from the Solomon Islands, attended a weekend of activities which celebrated the centenary of a locally founded church and participated in an unsolicited act of reconciliation with Australian people.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The venue was the verandahs and grounds of one of Australia's great colonial buildings, Fairymead House. This huge 64-square house, built along the lines of a classic Indian bungalow, forms a unique part of Australia's architectural heritage and has a unique place in the lives of many associated with the Queensland sugar industry. The Fairymead plantation, which was founded in 1880 by the Young brothers, Ernest, Horace and Henry, owes its name to an early visitor who, looking out on the fields in the rising mist, said that it looked like a veritable `fairy mead'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fairymead House stood in the cane fields, just north of Bundaberg, adjoining Fairymead mill. In 1890 it became the home of the Young family, the members of whom have made a significant contribution to the sugar industry, first, in their own right, later, as the Fairymead sugar company and, still later, as the Bundaberg Sugar Co., of which Fairymead was an early and major component. In 1988 the house was donated to the city of Bundaberg, along with a sizeable donation of $40,000, and moved to the botanical gardens where it stands in juxtaposition across the lakes from the equally famous Hinkler house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why, you might ask, do I give this historic background? It is because this house and the Young family were inextricably linked with the event which these Solomon Islanders and Australians of South Sea Islander background were celebrating. It was the 100th anniversary of the South Sea Evangelical Church. This group ranks with its Catholic and Anglican brethren as one of the most significant Christian groups in the Solomon Islands. Ernest, Horace and Henry Young had a sister, Florence, who loved these Melanesian workers and commenced Bible lessons for them in 1882. From these humble beginnings followed, in the 1930s, a simple timber church and church hall which, I might add, have been donated by the Bundaberg Sugar Co. to the South Sea Evangelical Church in recognition of the family and to celebrate the centenary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to 1884, the mission commenced in earnest, and Peter Ambuosa returned to Melanesia with the object of bringing his people to Christianity. That, in essence, was the reason for the celebration. Because of the repatriation of South Sea Islanders in 1906, many took their acquired Christian teachings with them. In fact, 18 per cent of the Solomon Islanders see Bundaberg as the genesis of their faith. As I sat looking out at these 500 local citizens and visitors, I must admit that I was filled with emotion: how could these people who, as a race, had been treated so wretchedly by generations of their Anglo-Australian masters return so openly and happily to celebrate their heritage?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an address of welcome by the Bundaberg Mayor, Alderman Nita Cunningham, Bobi Kusilifu gave an unbiased, if not generous, appraisal of the South Sea Islander heritage in Australia. He was followed by the guest of honour, the Hon. Michael Maeliau, Minister for Home Affairs in the Solomon Islands government. His speech was truly memorable. Putting behind him the inhumanity, beatings and ill-treatment, he offered a pledge of forgiveness and reconciliation. He said that the Solomon Islanders' tradition is that, when forgiveness is offered, it is absolute and unequivocal on their part. Without either judging or reflecting on the efforts between white and indigenous Australians for reconciliation, I could not help but observe how abundant was the goodwill from these people who had made such a significant contribution to Australia's early economy and received so little in return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a generous act of faith demands an examination of our own collective conscience on how Australia has treated its citizens of South Sea Island extraction. I refer the House to the motion moved by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on 30 September 1993. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House acts urgently to respond to the recommendations in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The call for recognition</EMPHASIS> to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)an end to discrimination against the descendants of South Sea Islanders;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4)that descendants of South Sea Islanders remain proud Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>At the time, he lamented that the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission of 15 December 1992, then nine months on, had not been acted upon in relation to the South Sea Islanders. Now, another 7 1/2 months further on, nothing has changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While, as a nation, with faltering degrees of enthusiasm, purpose and effectiveness, we have sought to address the injustices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, little has been done for those of South Sea Island extraction. Against Australia's 230,000 Aborigines and 27,000 Torres Strait Islanders, there are approximately 20,000 South Sea Islanders who rely on conventional avenues of support to advance themselves individually and collectively. There is no $1.3 billion ATSIC funding for them to draw on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might reflect on the appalling social injustices that were perpetrated on these people not only before but also beyond the physical aspects of the turn of the century; we might reflect on their forced repatriation when many of them, having worked their hearts out and built lives in Australia, were returned to their home countries to become outcasts all over again; and we might reflect on the most deliberate lack of educational facilities. This discrimination did not end until 1932-33 and shamed the then Queensland government to open special schools for Melanesian children initially around Mackay. It was not until the 1960s that a significant number of these children enjoyed secondary education, to say nothing of the refinements of such things as remedial teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might reflect on the mainstream churches that, after the repatriation of the South Sea Islanders to the South Pacific Islands, excluded those remaining from their mainstream congregations. We might reflect on those islanders, even Australian born, who were discouraged from working in the sugar industry. This was their entitlement as Australian born citizens. In fact, the Amalgamated Workers Association, later the AWU, denied them membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we, the current generation, are fair dinkum, we might look at some specific catch-up mechanisms. These are not people with a handout mentality. They are proud and gentle people who have made a significant contribution to this country. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall that, when the honourable member for Dawson made his speech, he outlined those who had lost their lives fighting for this country in Vietnam. He outlined significant contributions by people such as the author, and Mackay citizen, Noel Fatnowna, Mal Meninga in sport and, I might add to that, Faith Bandler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a first step to correct these injustices and to respond to the act of reconciliation which I witnessed on Friday from these Solomon Islander people, we might select a small number of well focused catch-up programs in the fields of health, education and housing. Between 1863 and 1906, 62,000 people from 80 Melanesian islands became part of the wider Australian community. No group of immigrants, if we can call them that given the way they were recruited, were so badly treated. Nevertheless, a significant group of them chose, from different sides of the Coral Sea, to seek a new and unqualified relationship with Australia as it is today. The gesture calls for reciprocity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a weekend of functions, memorial services, cultural gatherings, et cetera, the leader of the group, the Hon. Michael Maeliau, extended gifts of war clubs, spears and war boats as symbols of aggression never to be used again, and certainly not against Australia or Australians. Amongst these, a symbolic club, which the minister asked to be presented to the Australian parliament, was given to me. I extend this symbolic club to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on behalf of the Hon. Michael Maeliau, Minister for Home Affairs in the Solomon Islands government, and ask that you hand it to the Speaker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in response to the shameful comments by the conservative parties last week concerning veterans entitlements. On the ABC and in local newspapers in Queensland honourable members opposite tried to scare our war veterans by telling them that the government is preparing to cut their benefits. This tactic was deplorable and was quickly squashed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). When asked about it in this House, the minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . under this government the principle will always remain that the ex-service community is a unique and highly respected section of our society and deserves to be treated in a special way.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All Australians owe veterans from all campaigns a huge debt of gratitude&mdash;a debt which will be very difficult to repay in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that conservative members were `scaring an older section of our community by making people think they are going to lose entitlements which they will not lose'. The day that these allegations were made in Queensland calls came into my electoral office from veterans concerned about the loss of their entitlement. These people were scared. Some of them had fought long and hard to get their disability recognised and compensated. One old veteran said that years ago he was made to feel like a criminal when interrogated by various boards and tribunals about his claim for TPI. Given the latest allegations, he and others like him were being told that they could lose the entitlements that they had fought so hard for over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a feeling which I am personally familiar with in the sense that in the mid-1970s my father had his disability pension arbitrarily cut. It took years for it to be restored and finally increased to a TPI pension following numerous appeals to the appeal bodies. He died, however, knowing that finally his country had valued his war service but he never forgot the crass and harsh attack upon his benefits by the then Fraser government. It is in this context that veterans have received the latest scaremongering from the conservative parties. One particular veteran visited my office and spoke about the added stress and anxiety the report had caused him and his mates. As he spoke his voice was shaking and the perspiration was running down his face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people out there in our community working hard to ensure that veterans are treated fairly and justly. People like Eric Kay, state President of the RSL in Queensland, and Ted Tremayne, President of the Clayfield Toombul sub-branch of the RSL, are constantly on call for their members. People such as Kev Dean, President of the Sandgate branch of the Incapacitated Servicemen and Women's Association, a tireless advocate of disabled veterans, are constantly doing the rounds speaking to the veterans community. People such as Roy Glanville and Pat Quinn of the Kedron-Wavell RSL, Gordon O'Sullivan of the Sandgate RSL, Syd Bradly and Mick Beeston, President and Secretary of the Geebung RSL, Jim Comerford and Bert Bunning of the Banyo RSL and George Catchpole and David Prince from the Nundah-Northgate RSL all know just how alarming such claims from the opposition can be and what personal distress they cause to the veterans themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of scare tactic headline grabbing makes their work so much harder and creates unnecessary anxiety and suffering to people who have already suffered enough. This is particularly the case when we consider the government's recent record, which is eminently fair to veterans, in particular; the increases in the rate of service pension from 22.7 per cent of average weekly earnings in 1983 to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;the last time the pension rate was higher as a proportion of average weekly earnings was in March 1949; the legislation that has been passed to ensure that the TPI pension is paid for life; the indexation of fringe benefits income limits in line with consumer price index movements; the extension from 1 April 1993 of the full range of Commonwealth fringe benefits to all service pensioners and to all war widows in receipt of a social security pension; the introduction of the extreme disabled with adjustment benefit for severely disabled veterans; and a seniors health card which will be extended to all those veterans, spouses and carers who meet the age requirement and are eligible for service pension but whose assets exclude them from receiving the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments from members of the opposition are also particularly regrettable when one considers the policy alternatives put forward by them in this House. Although they profess to have dropped Fightback, they constantly come into this House and call for cuts in public expenditure. In particular, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), constantly calls for this country to adopt Asian levels of taxation. Adopting Asian levels of taxation in this country would result in cuts to the revenue of between $10 billion and $20 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adopting a taxation level similar to that of Indonesia would require cuts to the revenue of something like $12 billion in this country. When it is considered that in the last budget the government allocated in excess of $5 billion to veterans entitlements, the sorts of spending cuts called for by the opposition would involve cutting the full amount of money allocated to veterans in this country twice over. The opposition is bereft of any serious policy in this area and it ill becomes its members to come into this House and elsewhere to use those scare tactics, which have no foundation in fact or government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to talk briefly about long-term unemployment. We all know that it is a huge problem in our community, threatening not only the people involved but our whole social fabric. If Australia does not invest in the job compact as proposed in the white paper we will pay more later, economically and socially. Acting on long-term unemployment is not just a question of social justice, important as that is. It is also a question of economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of looking at the bleeps on the computer screens, the money markets would do far better to look at long-term unemployment and all of the social and economic arguments for implementing a job compact to rid us of that problem. Dealers in the money market so critical of the white paper should take the time to drop into the Smith Family on their way to the futures market so that they can find out about what is happening in the present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little awareness by some economists and money market dealers of the full extent of the problem of long-term unemployment. They are unaware not only of the social cost but also of just how many of our resources, human and capital, are being wasted. The fact is that long-term unemployment corrupts our labour market and erodes our competitiveness. If some of the dealers in the money market were being economically rational, they would consider the case for intervention in terms of warding off unnecessary wage pressures and inflationary pressures flowing from the skills mismatch between available vacancies and the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Ross Gittins has written frequently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the problem is that there is too little consciousness on the part of economists and idealogues in the money market of the extent of the problem. What many of them are unaware of is not just the social cost but also the huge waste of resources, both human and capital. Economists must be mindful of the numbers of long-term unemployed and the economic costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that cutting back on long-term unemployment is very good news for the budget and very good news for the economy. Dr Bruce Chapman of the Australian National University has produced a set of hard-headed calculations setting out the potential benefits of attacking long-term unemployment. He has found that, if we can decrease the number of long-term unemployed so as to cut 0.5 per cent off the current unemployment rate, those put to work will provide $110 million in taxes for the government and the reduction in unemployment benefits in one year will be $327 million. So the overall attack on the budget deficit is about $440 million. In addition, those long-term unemployed put back to work would add almost $800 million in additional output to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Chapman has gone further and said that if we were to cut 0.876 per cent off the existing unemployment rate there would be a net gain to the budget of $765 million. Reflecting further, he stated that if we gain impetus and succeeded in cutting the unemployment rate by 1.25 per cent the benefits to the budget would pass $1 billion, reaching almost $1.1 billion. The saving in unemployment benefits would be over $800 million and increased tax receipts would approach $300 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find depressing is that so many dry economists, dealers in the money markets and others take none of this into account. The only solutions they put forward are cuts to the social safety net and challenges to the strategies suggested in the white paper. What the markets have to understand is that the white paper expenditure is a cheap way out. What I cannot understand is why they do not take the long-term view. The sorts of policies they advocate will produce an underclass. When they talk about cuts to the safety net everybody in this House should understand that the emphasis should be on the word `safety'. If we want to live in a civilised community free from poverty and tensions that produced events such as the LA riots, we have to take the long-term view. A recent report from the Australian Institute of Criminology concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our fear as criminologists is that two to three decades of continued relegation of more than 300,000 Australians to long-term unemployment may put us at risk of crime figures close to those of the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the compelling case in the short term and in the long term to do something substantial about long-term unemployment. The measures advocated in the white paper&mdash;the measures which provide real incentives to business, the measures which shake up the Commonwealth Employment Service, the radical changes to the social security system&mdash;combined are producing and will produce the most comprehensive attack on this problem ever seen in this country's history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prompted to participate in this grievance debate by comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time. During question time the Prime Minister reflected on his visit to the Sunraysia region and on what he had seen in the Sunraysia region while in the company of my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). The Prime Minster reflected on his concern about the message that had come to him in the Sunraysia about the need for irrigation redevelopment and about the particular frustration that he found with the fixture of small farm size that needed some sort of intervention, he felt, in order to be exanded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the Prime Minister's foray into a region that is very like my own. I welcome his recognition, for the first time in this House, of what horticulture can offer in terms of a turnaround both in employment opportunities and in export opportunities for Australia. I particularly welcome his recognition of the fact that there is a need to change irrigation practice in the Sunraysia and, indeed, in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission area because that is much of what I have been saying during the 11 years or so that I have represented the seat of Wakefield in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly pertinent that the Prime Minister should come into the House today, in May 1994, making a plea for the sorts of changes he felt were important after his visit to the Sunraysia. I suspect that my state right now faces the real threat of drought conditions. I am not a scaremonger, and I concede that it may well rain within the next month and the threat of a drought may be averted, but we certainly have experienced, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, would be aware, the driest March in 124 years and a real failure of rain since November last year. This means that the reservoirs that are part of Adelaide's catchment area for domestic water are now running desperately dry and are being topped up and maintained only by constant intervention of water from the Murray, charged of course from the Murray-Darling Basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also not without coincidence that my observations and the Prime Minister's remarks occur in 1994, which is the centenary of irrigation development in the Riverland area. I thought, in view of the remarks made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), and in view of his reflection on the white paper, it was worth the House considering that in 1894, 100 years ago, the government of the day decided to intervene in the economy, as the government of today has decided to intervene, and provide an opportunity for those who had been unemployed and who had been caught up in the bitter recession that had preceded 1894 to set up irrigation settlements along the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that those irrigation settlements, established at Waikerie, Moorook, New Residence and Lyrup, had varying success. In their early days, the only opportunity new settlers had to access any one of these settlements and the only way provisions could be got into the settlements was principally by way of paddle-steamer down a river whose flows were unpredictable. Sometimes the area was accessible; sometimes it was not. As a result of this uncertain accessibility we had the settlements of the river serviced irregularly, facing all sorts of medical deprivation, facing sometimes food deprivation. The fact that the river's flow was so unpredictable meant that the irrigation settlements they established sometimes ran short of water because the pumping location was not low enough to pick up what was a diminishing water flow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you will appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, these were communities in which frustration was inherent. It is interesting to note that these communities were originally set up as communal settlements. Every member of the community was expected to make a contribution into a common pool and to withdraw resources from that pool as they were required. While the intention in these settlements was no doubt honourable, they failed for a very human reason. In many instances, the family men decided that this was to their advantage because they were quite rightly able to draw more from the pool to support their families. But the bachelors in the communities became frustrated because they saw themselves as making every bit as energetic a contribution to the pool but were unable to withdraw the same amount from it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary has made an interesting intervention about the concept of cooperative public houses, which I freely concede did subsequently survive. Even today, cooperative irrigation&mdash;that is, water distribution&mdash;has also been very successful. But the concept of a communal settlement failed. It needs to be recognised that this was a very important exercise in social engineering that failed. It was originally set up by the government as a role model for government intervention, relieving the desperate need of the unemployed in 1894.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want my remarks to be construed as some sort of criticism of the government. In fact, I am the first to concede that much of what the government has done in maintaining the existing Murray-Darling Basin has been commendable. In my own electorate, between the communities of Woolpunda and Waikerie, the government has spent about $25 million on salt interception schemes to keep these riverland settlements alive and well and to ensure that the quality of water in the river is maintained. That $25 million picks up what is a natural saline inflow&mdash;not a drainage saline inflow&mdash;resulting from the area having once been a vast inland sea. The consequent salt interception scheme, which involves 49 bores along both sides of the river, intervening in water that is two-thirds as salty as seawater, has meant that the salinity at Morgan, at the point at which the river ceases its westward journey and turns south to the sea, will be reduced by eight per cent. That is commendable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that government intervention from both sides of the House, but currently from the Keating government, has been useful in maintaining water quality. However, I qualify that comment by referring to the experience of the people of 1894 when government intervention effectively failed because it imposed on them a nanny state. The government wanted to assume responsibility for everything and they desperately wanted responsibility, particularly for the direction that they were choosing to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of May 1994 and the white paper, I think it is useful for the government to consider the opportunity that horticulture currently offers in terms of job creation. My criticism of the white paper is that there is too much emphasis on training and too little emphasis on job creation. The government has clearly recognised, by its decision in the white paper to inject $850,000 into the Sunraysia community, that putting money into horticultural areas will generate opportunities for horticultural advancement and export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My plea in this grievance debate is that the $850,000 ought not be made available in lieu of the commitment the government already had to River Murray salinity control; that is, I do not want it to be part of the capital works funding that I have already enjoyed in my electorate and that has to happen in the Sunraysia, regardless of the white paper. Rather than using the instrumentality of the white paper as some form of intervention in the life of the community, I call on the government to recognise that those communities are already alive and well. In the case of the dried vine fruit industry, the dried tree fruit industry and the wine grape industry, those growers are doing well. The opportunity exists for the government to build on its white paper in tomorrow night's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should offer the one industry which is most burdened in the Sunraysia, in my own area and in the Riverina-Darling&mdash;that is, the citrus industry&mdash;an opportunity for some sort of tax break. Currently, if citrus processors use 25 per cent of Australian juice, they get a sales tax concession on the juice that they produce. But under GATT that 25 per cent arrangement would have to disappear. I think it would be appropriate for the government to consider supporting these horticultural areas, not only by this injection of Sunraysia funds but also by treating the citrus industry as the dairy industry is treated and treating 100 per cent juice just as pure milk is treated. Therefore, pure juice should be treated as sales tax exempt. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Science and technology are vital to Australia's future. In increasingly highly competitive and contested markets, technological innovation is fundamental for firm survival. Innovation is a necessary part of investment and economic growth. In building on Australia's capabilities in science and technology, there must be a realistic assessment of our strengths and weaknesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's previously inward looking industry policies, adopted over many years of coalition rule and extended during the Fraser era, damaged the technological fabric of our manufacturing base. Further, the increased importance of manufactured goods in international trade and the need to further process Australia's mineral and agricultural products have demanded renewed technological effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition&mdash;the Liberal and National parties&mdash;is completely unsympathetic to these changes and the challenges facing the nation. Honourable members will recall how the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) came under the spell of his svengali, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who was the self-proclaimed political mastermind of that 500-page suicide note known as Fightback. Who is the honourable member for Goldstein? David O'Reilly, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 3 December 1991, described him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kemp, 49, is Hewson's shadow minister for education, one of the little-known frontbenchers who would evolve into household names only if the coalition won the 1993 election. Quietly spoken, with a tailored beard and piercing blue eyes, he played a vital role in helping to construct the GST package. After Hewson himself, Kemp became the mastermind of the most adventurous piece of political and economic policy making by an opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 18 March 1992 was headed `Kemp wants fair go for rich Australians'. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 8 March 1990, written by Tim Colebatch, quotes the honourable member for Goldstein as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It was the Fraser government that really stood at the turning point of Australian history . . . It was during those years that the agenda which is still being written and carried out was first initiated."</PARA>
<PARA>That is in stark contrast to an article by Michael Warby, a member of the Federal Council of the Liberal Party, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Quadrant</EMPHASIS> magazine of May 1994. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fraser Government presided over the period when high inflation, mass unemployment and plummeting national savings rates became entrenched, and growth in living standards stagnated.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not the end of it. In an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 13 August 1991, under the heading `Education', the same David O'Reilly referred to the honourable member for Goldstein in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of the market would gradually permeate education. Shadow minister David Kemp says by the end of the century the local school should have greater control over its own destiny, being essentially an independent "enterprise" where the principal, for example, would have the power to hire and fire staff and parents would have greater power as "consumers". Schools would be funded by their capacity to attract students.</PARA>
<PARA>In his own right, as shadow minister for education, the ideological prescription of the honourable member for Goldstein would have damaged the future of education in Australia. The coalition's education policy was condemned by the electorate at the last election. Perhaps the coalition considers the honourable member for Goldstein safely placed in the science portfolio where his electorally damaging excesses will have little impact. But I urge the Liberal Party to consider not just electoral expediency but also the national interest in the allocation of portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many countries in our region would find it strange to have a shadow minister for science denigrating Australia's capabilities. Australians should not underestimate the damage his statements can make. It becomes more serious when the Leader of the Opposition receives his information through the ideological filter of the honourable member for Goldstein. The Leader of the Opposition, in his address on science and technology delivered on 27 April this year, informed his audience at Monash University of the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent study by UNESCO found that the science and technology effort of countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan now surpassed that of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar assertion is to be found in an article by the honourable member for Goldstein in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 February 1994. That statement is false. Australia spends more on R&amp;D than either Singapore or Taiwan. As I informed the House on 25 November 1993 during the grievance debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1990, Australia's expenditure on research and development was $US4 billion. In the same year, Singapore's research and development expenditure was approximately $US320 million. Based on UNESCO data the expenditure on R&amp;D by the ASEAN countries, in total, was less than $US1 billion, a quarter of the R&amp;D expenditure of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's scientific research effort is efficient and effective. A measure of Australian research effectiveness is the share of published work in scientific journals made up by Australian scientists. Australians contribute about 2.1 per cent of world scientific papers, more than double the combined total of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia, whose scientists contribute about one per cent of scientific papers. These figures clearly demonstrate that Australian scientific research output far exceeds the combined total of those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of deriding Australia's research and development effort, the Leader of the Opposition should be promoting Australia as a regional powerhouse of research and development. If he took the time to talk to the state premiers, I am sure that they would tell him that Australia is one of the most competitive places in the world to undertake research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Australia is attracting the world's best research companies and their staff. Major international enterprises with significant investments in R&amp;D in Australia include Digital, UNISYS, Oracle, Ericsson, IBM and Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques. Firms which have made recent decisions to establish R&amp;D centres in Australia include Data General, Canon, Motorola, NCR, Siemens and Microsoft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Digital has established a global development centre at Bond University to act as a focal point for Optus's operational support system, R&amp;D and engineering expertise for global telecommunications. The centre employs 45 R&amp;D engineers and involves an investment by Digital of $50 million to the year 2000. In March 1994, Digital announced it will invest an additional $50 million by the year 2000, and this will involve an additional 40 computer software engineering jobs. Exports are estimated at up to $700 million over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could mention the work that has been done by UNISYS, Motorola, Siemens and Microsoft. Microsoft established its regional headquarters in Australia in 1993. The regional headquarters is responsible for key corporation mandates in the area of systems education, product development, the provision of developer support for the Asia-Pacific and key R&amp;D. Microsoft has committed $65 million to R&amp;D and exports over the next four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein has continued the practice he established as education spokesperson of attempting to ingratiate himself with his constituency regardless of his and his party's policy position. In his media release of 4 May, he stated that the white paper  `misrepresents funding for science agencies as an increase'. The honourable member for Goldstein knows that the government has done precisely what it stated it had done in the white paper&mdash;it has increased funding by $34 million per year over the next three years. The funding base is from the forward estimates published and available for all to read in the budget delivered last year in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While playing games with statements by the government, the opposition remains coy about its own intentions. The personal philosophy of the honourable member for Goldstein has been outlined in a speech entitled `Dismantling the juggernaut'. He advocates `liberalising the technology market' and pointedly refers only to education and basic research&mdash;not strategic research&mdash;as areas of public good that markets cannot adequately provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the opposition. The time has come to throw away ideological blinkers and embrace a bipartisan approach to the nation's science and technology capability&mdash;a bipartisan approach based on recognising Australia's strengths, not denigrating them, and recognising that there has been an explosion of innovative activity in Australia's best firms. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few weeks, thousands of women in my electorate have signed petitions seeking that the government increase funding for breast cancer treatment and research. I am sure that many women across the nation have also signed petitions. I understand that petitions will be presented to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) today to present to the House. Many thousands of signatures will appear on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today, 100,000 women have breast cancer disease and every year in the order of 2,500 women die of breast cancer disease. It is time that the government recognised its responsibility and initiated a national strategy for breast cancer treatment and research. It has neglected to address the matter in a systematic way. We have heard a lot of rhetoric about breast cancer over the last few years, but we have not seen much real action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it difficult to understand how medical researchers and the medical profession can stand up today and criticise parliamentarians when we take this issue to the public and see that it is forwarded in a positive way. For too long parliamentarians have been accused of just getting up, spouting rhetoric and not taking any action. This time we have acted on this important national issue. The accusations from the media, the medical profession in some areas and cancer foundations have come in thick and fast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government develops a strategy. The benefit of a national strategy is well supported by the success of the national heart program, which has achieved a drop in the mortality rate of heart disease. A similar approach must be put in place to tackle breast cancer. This issue simply has to move beyond politics, both in this place and within the medical fraternity. It is a killer disease that delivers sick women every day to death, and it affects many of the nation's families. The strategies that need to be put in place are numerous, but they include things such as new treatment and resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An expanded program will be designed to ensure early detection. We need an awareness and an education program to educate the women and men of this nation and the general practitioners. We need a network for the coordination and exchange of data. At the moment, it seems to be a little hit and miss. We need to increase the number of women with breast cancer admitted to clinical trials. I think at the moment about 250 women are involved in clinical trials. Dr Forbes would like to see that expanded to 3,000 women. At the moment, the funding is not there to allow this expanded clinical trials program to proceed. That should be part of the whole approach, part of the total strategy of addressing this issue of breast cancer treatment and research funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that strategy we need to look at issues in detection and treatment, such as the difficulty for country women who cannot afford to leave their families and head to the city for weeks of protracted treatment in the case where they are found to have a malignancy. So many of these women have to opt for a total mastectomy, which means the total removal of the breast and surrounding tissues, instead of a partial treatment which would mean the retention in most cases of that woman's breast. I think it is a sad indictment of the way we have proceeded with the treatment programs and the detection programs that we do not offer to our country women opportunities to have the same kinds of treatment as women in the city areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition at no time has advocated an increase in funding without a proper strategy to ensure that funding allocated does produce the very best results. I am sure that all of us would want to see that. But it is a great shame to this nation that the concern by many parliamentarians on both sides of this House has been hijacked by criticisms, as I said earlier, from many people across many interest groups. A joint statement put out recently by the Australian Medical Association and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians warned that it would be a tragedy if politicians dictated the research agenda for doctors and scientists. I did not think that the call for increased funding meant that politicians were going to dictate the way in which those funds were to be utilised within the area of breast cancer research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They went further to warn that Australia's high standard of medical research would be threatened if medical research funding were not channelled through a peer review. Again, I do not think that there is any indication that decisions about how breast cancer research funding would be used would be dictated to by any of the parliamentarians supporting this issue in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They went further to say, `We strongly support additional funding being made available for breast cancer research.' I am not quite sure what they mean by this. It would seem to me that both of these statements are in contradiction. But, they said, the best way to do this is to increase the total pool of funds available to the NHMRC for medical research purposes. I have no argument with this at all. We all know that in Australia today we set aside 1.4 per cent of our total health budget to medical research. That is a total disgrace in a developed nation like Australia. The international best practice is two per cent. We have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) get up in this place and beat his chest and say that he is going to increase research funding up to two per cent, but then comes the bad news&mdash;not until the year 2000. It is not good enough that by the year 2000 we will lift our funding to the point where it is in other developed nations today. The Prime Minister must with some urgency address the need to lift medical research funding here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laurie Wright from the Cancer Council warned that the minister could be setting a precedent for the government. He said she could be putting her foot on a fairly slippery slope by using political persuasion to get more research on a nominated disease&mdash;that if the government is seen to bend to pressure groups and certainly if there is a very powerful lobby headed by no less than the Prime Minister's wife, then we do not know what issue will be picked up by an equally powerful group. But that precedent was set some time ago. It is an unfortunate fact that when the government allocated $10.5 million in 1993 to the national AIDS program fund, the process of lobbying for medical research was well established. The precedent has been set. It is the government who has taken the lead on this agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can blame women and men in Australia for taking the initiative to lobby government over a disease that affects so many families and with a death rate reputed to be increasing at the rate of two per cent per annum. Senator Richardson, in answering a question put to him by Senator Kay Patterson on Commonwealth funding for research, made the point himself that funding for medical research is not distributed on the base of disease state. I am not quite sure what he means by that. The National Health and Medical Research Council, he went on to say, advises the government on the allocation of funding for health and medical research and proposals are assessed on the basis of scientific merit, not specific disease state. If that is the case, why have we had a budget directed to AIDS research that in the last several years has exceeded $10 million?</PARA>

The Treasurer is rostered to appear tomorrow, but in accordance with the normal practice he is to be excused from attendance tomorrow. That is, it has developed as the practice in this House that the Treasurer is not to turn up at question time on the day of the budget. It used not to be the practice, I might say, but we have become a little more precious and fragile in recent years and we find it necessary not to turn up on the day of the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had an indication from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), or through his office, that the Treasurer may be turning up on the Wednesday but I want something more than that. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know and the House knows how unhappy we are with the new question time arrangements and I just want to say again that it will be absolutely outrageous if both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are not present. Everyone knows that this Prime Minister interferes very heavily in budget preparations. Virtually not a day goes by without there being some story in the paper about how the Prime Minister has intervened to overturn a decision of the Expenditure Review Committee. He was in there making a big bloke of himself by allegedly overturning some decision in relation to funding for Aboriginal health and he was at it again in relation to foreign aid. So he cannot on the one hand say, `Ralph may be there but this is my budget,' sending that signal to the outside world, but when it comes to a bit of accountability before the parliament not be there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what I am saying to the Parliamentary Secretary opposite, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), is that unless we have an undertaking that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are going to be here&mdash;and I would like the undertaking to be given during this debate&mdash;I am sorry but I do not regard the sort of generalised indication through his office that the Treasurer might turn up on Wednesday as good enough. I say again: he is going to deliver the budget tomorrow night. He is going to go to the National Press Club at lunchtime on Wednesday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report I present concerns the unauthorised disclosure and publication of details of a draft report and deliberations of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. The articles in question appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 October 1993 and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 21 and 25 October 1993. In addition, comments on a WIN evening news broadcast on 25 October were referred to the committee. Each matter concerned a then forthcoming report from the public accounts committee on the operations of the Australian Taxation Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence received by my committee enabled it to find that the publication of the articles complained of in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 October, one of the articles in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 25 October and the comments on the WIN news broadcasts of 25 October, each indicated a knowledge of discussions which had taken place at private meetings of a sectional committee of the public accounts committee. These proceedings have not been authorised for publication. My committee was not able to make a finding in respect of two of the other articles complained of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received evidence of the effect that the unauthorised disclosure of the information in question had on the work of the public accounts committee. My committee was impressed by the evidence of the chairman and vice-chairman of the joint committee who spoke of the traditions of the public accounts committee in terms of its bipartisanship and the confidentiality which characterised its proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee of Privileges was unable to ascertain the source of the disclosures in question. If a person or persons responsible for the disclosure or disclosures acted deliberately, he, she or they were guilty of a serious breach of the prohibitions on unauthorised disclosure. In light of its findings, the committee is, however, unable to make any recommendations on the particular matter referred to it. The committee took the opportunity presented by this reference to consider the procedures which are followed in respect of complaints about the unauthorised disclosure of committee material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since September 1990, successive Speakers have required committees from which there have been unauthorised disclosures to undertake some preliminary consideration of the matter before a decision is taken by the Speaker as to whether a prima facie case exists. These procedures have served the House well, although, unlike the position in the House of Commons, they have not been endorsed explicitly by the House itself. In our view, it would be desirable for the House to adopt such procedures formally, and we have included in our report a draft resolution which would achieve this. We commend this proposal for the consideration of members. We also recommend that steps be taken to provide briefings for media personnel at which such matters could be explained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report concerns the service of a writ on the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca). The writ in question was served on behalf of a Mr A. Robinson and followed a letter the honourable member for Bowman had written to the then Minister for Arts and Administrative Services concerning government decisions on Comcar. Mr Robinson took objection to comments made about him in the letter and caused a writ to be prepared and served on the honourable member for Bowman seeking damages for libel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has examined the relevant law on this matter and has received written and oral evidence and submissions from the honourable member and from Mr Robinson. The committee accepts that, in writing to the minister as he did, the honourable member for Bowman was making representations on behalf of constituents and others in circumstances that would be familiar to all members. It accepts that, as a result of Mr Robinson's action in causing a writ to be issued and served on him, the honourable member felt constrained in making further representations on behalf of his constituents in relation to decisions about Comcar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law is such that letters concerning constituency and related matters from members to ministers do not form part of proceedings in parliament. They are thus not protected by parliamentary privilege. Nevertheless, each House has the power to deal with offences which, while not breaching any particular right or immunity, do amount to improper interference with the free performance by a member of his or  her duties as a member. The committee has considered this aspect in respect of this reference. We have been very conscious of the situation in which the honourable member for Bowman has found himself. We appreciate the constraint under which he has found himself after the writ was served on him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has concluded, however, that there is no evidence to establish that Mr Robinson had intended to interfere improperly with the free performance by the honourable member for Bowman of his duties as a member. It has found that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, a finding of contempt should not be made in respect of Mr Robinson's action in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In speaking to the reports of the Standing Committee of Privileges, can I first deal with the public accounts matter. Whilst not offering a dissenting report in relation to the matter, I think it is fair to say that the roles of committees have changed over time. I think the worst thing that can happen to a committee is that its recommendations be ignored, its report pigeonholed and no further action taken. I think the parliament has to understand, now that the House has adopted&mdash;very much at the urging of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay)&mdash;a more vigorous committee system in line with the Senate, that very often a committee's role is just beginning rather than finishing when it brings down its recommendations. I agree with the Chairman of the Standing Committee of Privileges, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford), that this presents a real difficulty for committees, given the current standing orders. As a chairman of a joint select committee, I must say that I think we need to work out the thin red line, if you like, between preserving the interests of the House and informing the public, which we have an overwhelming right to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the more important report is the one concerning the issuing of a writ against the honourable member for Bowman. I am not issuing a dissenting report, but I want to say frankly to all honourable members that it is a very sad day when, having written a rather fulsome and frank letter to a minister which the committee has conceded is a legitimate communication between a member of the House and a minister, the subsequent publication of that letter has led to the issuing of a writ on a member and the privileges committee has been unable to find a breach of privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really goes in this modern era to the heart of the role of a member of parliament. It was all right at Federation when there were no offices and when people would come here for six months at a time and not be overly concerned about written forms of communications with ministers because, frankly, with seven portfolio ministers, business could be done in person anyway. But technology has moved on. People's demands have moved on. We have all now been beneficiaries of that revolution of actually having electorate offices amidst the people whom we seek to serve. We have all been part of that revolution that has given us staff in those electorate offices amongst the people whom we seek to serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my time, we have actually got fax machines. We have dispensed with pigeons and turbocharged pigeons; we have letters, we have faxes and, in fact, we can E-mail communications to ministers. But I regret to say, and I am sure my honourable and learned friend the chairman of the privileges committee would concede, that privileges have not caught up with that fact. I would assert on behalf of all members of this House that I ought to be able to frankly and freely state my mind to ministers of the Crown on behalf of my constituents unencumbered by the threat of a writ or a defamation suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the honourable member for Bowman, who was perhaps even more concerned about what was happening to Comcar than I was, felt that way when he first wrote that letter to the then Minister for Arts and Administrative Services. I do not argue before my peers that publication of that letter should be privileged&mdash;that is, that the publication in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> should be privileged&mdash;but I do argue very strongly about the rights of members of this House to communicate to ministers in a very up-front way because I regret that these days, and perhaps it was ever thus, members sometimes need to do so to attract the attention of ministers and, if not their attention, the attention of their staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I am very conscious that members of this House, and certainly members of the privileges committee, are very concerned that the rights and prerequisites of members should not overwhelm and overpower ordinary citizens. I think that is very perceptive because I think that is a function of the age in which we live. I would be one who would support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very difficult to accept the argument that Mr Robinson, a senior public servant acting in charge of Comcare, who had served in a ministerial office, was somehow ignorant of the forms of the House and the force of privilege.

Therefore, I do not say that he should have no rights before this House but that we ought to be cognisant of his background. We should not assume him to be innocent when he is fully knowledgeable. If anything, that is where I take exception to my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But I am heartened by the Committee of Privileges. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest that you should be, as all other members of the House should be. We need to bring privileges up to the modern day. There ought to be no more cases like this one. When as members of parliament we write to the executive and ministers of the Crown, it ought to attract privilege. When we fax communications to ministers of the Crown, it ought to attract privilege. When we EPN through our electorate offices via the network, it ought to attract privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am heartened by the fact that my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide and the privileges committee are going to examine this very issue. I believe that after they have examined it carefully and in detail they will agree with me that no member of this parliament should be intimidated by standing up in a very frank and fulsome way to the highest or the lowest in his or her electorate. We have an unfettered right to represent our members to ministers and to be unencumbered by threats, pressure or any consequence other than wishing to fight and stand up for those constituents. Whilst I support the Committee of Privileges report, I do so in the knowledge that things must and will change for the future so that no other member will be placed in the same position as the honourable member for Bowman.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the discussion that took place last Thursday, much was being made by members of the opposition about the requirement under the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;the amendment will deal with it later&mdash;for the establishment of a register. The accusation was consistently being made that the establishment of a register would be taking the industry back to the pre-reform arrangements. I mentioned that that was not the case, and it certainly is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register proposed by the bill does not have any bearing whatsoever upon the employee arrangements or the employer arrangements within the industry. The bill requires a committee to establish a register for the names of stevedoring employees, and the amendment that is being proposed by the government will ensure that employers will not have to provide any employee information where, for example, time and wages records are being maintained. These proposals enable the requirements of the convention to be satisfied without any additional obligation on employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For normal transactions, there is already a requirement for normal activities to keep those records. So the bill, in effect, proposes streamlining the stevedoring legislation and maintains the reform that has already been achieved. I find it very difficult to understand why the opposition has been able to work itself into such a frenzy about this aspect of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mentioned in Thursday's debate the comparison of performance of ports. Again, those who criticise the waterfront seem to be obsessed with what happens inside the wharf gate and are totally unable to see that there is life beyond the waterfront gate. In fact, there are greater costs incurred beyond the gate in the journey back to the landside origin or landside destination of cargo. There is greater potential in that area for improvement in productivity. This obsession with what happens inside the gate diverts us from what we ought to be looking at these days: how do we get the users of the waterfront to better coordinate their activities to get a better level of efficiency in how they fit in with the services being provided on the waterfront?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the comparisons are made between Australian ports and external ports. I will run through some figures to put this into proper perspective. Making international comparisons with Australian ports is extremely difficult. Almost always the comparisons are of unlikes; Australian ports are compared with Asian ports. In 1992-93, for instance, the total number of 20-foot equivalent units, TEUs, handled by all Australian ports&mdash;and over a dozen of them handle some number of containers at some time&mdash;was 1.8 million. That compares with the largest port in the world, Hong Kong, with which we are often compared. In calendar year 1993 Hong Kong handled 9.62 million TEUs. Singapore, which is the second largest port, handled 9.04 million TEUs. Comparisons between individual Australian ports and ports like Hong Kong, Singapore and Rotterdam&mdash;as I have said, they are comparisons of unlikes&mdash;serve no useful purpose and confuse the debate rather than enabling us to concentrate on the areas where there is room for improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at last year 1992-93&mdash;I should correct those figures I have just used&mdash;we see that the actual number of TEUs handled in Australia was 1.935 million. In the six months to the end of December across Australia, in Sydney, Melbourne, Fremantle and Adelaide, 928,211 TEUs were handled. That does not include&mdash;there will be some addition to that&mdash;TEUs handled by the ports of Newcastle, Port Kembla and the Tasmanian ports; in all, more than a dozen ports. But it enables the parliament to get some grasp of this fragmented task we have in Australia. In New South Wales, in 1992-93 there were 565,000 containers handled. To get some sort of comparison, we can say that in New South Wales twice as many containers were handled as in Queensland. Victoria handles three times as many containers as are handled in Queensland over the course of a year. I mention that again to concentrate upon this fragmentation of the Australian task. It is idiotic and irresponsible to argue that we should be trying to achieve or are expected to achieve within Australia the same handling rates as are achieved in the great ports of the world, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Rotterdam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next important point to make is that the size of ships we handle in Australia is much smaller than those handled in the great ports I have mentioned. The numbers of cranes used on those great ports are much greater. They might be working with one or two cranes. The configuration of ships is different. There are obstructions. If we go down to the port at Botany and look at the size of some of those ships, we find that they are carrying 250 to 300 containers with gear and away hatch covers, with the configuration I have mentioned, the location of the masts and the cranes. It is like trying to compare the unloading of a utility with the unloading of an unobstructed semi-trailer; they are just `unlike comparisons'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point is the gear used in Australia. The youngest crane in Australia is 20 years of age. That compares to the `you beaut' gear being introduced in the great ports of the world. Then we have the comparisons where we are told that the costs or port charges of some of the port facilities are greater in Australia. What is not said in that kind of comparison, from whatever source it comes, is that in many of the overseas ports the capital investment is provided by government; the cost is not borne by the port users. So either the capital investment is subsidised or, in other cases, the ports are not required to pay dividends, as is the case in all of the major ports in Australia. In effect, the major ports in Australia have now all become de facto taxing agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the comparisons of those, we will see that the level of revenue being extracted from the ports really amounts to an industry policy; that the state governments, particularly New South Wales and Victoria, require their port authority to level a scale of charges to generate the dividend that they want from those ports. In effect, that amounts to an industry policy. In both of those cases, the governments ought to come clean and declare it to be an industry policy rather than having this de facto tax or industry levy masquerading as simply a port charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charges of the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales have been falling. Port revenue per tonne dropped from $1.73 in 1986-87 to $1.33 in 1992-93. But the question I want to ask is: how much further could that revenue have dropped if the MSB were not required to pay a dividend? With Commonwealth government business enterprises, GBEs, the government's standard for dividends is around 50 per cent of operating profit. In 1992-93 the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales had to pay almost all of its operating profit to the state government. It made a profit of $91.8 million, $89.5 million of which had to be paid or handed on to the state government by way of dividend. So I think it is fairly clear that the use of the ports and port pricing policies by state governments is a major factor in the charges that are imposed on port users for containers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland separately has made the point that in that state, in the process of corporatising its ports, it will not be converting its ports into milch cows, as have New South Wales and Victoria. That, in effect, will give Queensland an advantage. If we look at the upgrading of the National Rail Corporation which is taking place, it is well likely to be the case a few years further down the track that, as the Rail Corporation improves its performance and linkages with Queensland ports, they will benefit to the cost of the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. We might argue that Sydney and Melbourne will maintain a number of containers. However, if they maintain the number of containers that they are handling, it is more likely that they will not get their share of the growth that is occurring and which is ahead of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be competition between the ports for cargoes that are mobile and can be transhipped between ports, such as by the north-south land bridge we are talking about from Brisbane south to Sydney and Sydney south to Melbourne. That will have an effect on how the ports perform and, hopefully, on the state governments, unless the Council of Australian Governments at its meetings reaches an agreement that port authorities should not be operated as milch cows; that the concentration upon efficiency, productivity and minimisation of costs to users will be the priority. If there is to be some arrangement between federal government and state government over revenues that may have to be forgone or altered, I hope the Council of Australian Governments will have that item on its agenda and will be looking at improving performance in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A paper from the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics, which was used recently, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major issues in the debate about the Port Authority charges is the appropriate balance between ship and cargo based charges.</PARA>
<PARA>But, on a cost per TEU basis, cargo based charges, which are the charges levied by port authorities on behalf of state governments, still represent about 60 per cent of port and related charges. So the debate goes on from the other side of the House and out in selected parts of the general community about stevedoring charges and waterside workers. Waterside workers and stevedoring companies have improved their productivity and performance. They are doing a much better job, even though their youngest crane is 20 years of age and even though the utilisation rates in some ports are quite low. But, given that improvement has taken place, it is to little avail if the reductions being made there are being offset by the levying of state based charges, what we call cargo based charges which, in effect, are the charges levied for wharfage. That is the major area which is involved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always interesting to sit and listen to the comments made by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), who is quite respected around this place for his experience and views on these matters, particularly on matters pertaining to his former portfolio. I will take up a couple of points that the honourable member has raised in comparing like with like. The honourable member for Shortland was comparing gross throughputs between some of the major ports around the world and some of the ports around Australia. What we need to identify is the productivity of the ports. Accepting the fact that our ports are smaller, that we have fewer loading cranes and that we deal with smaller ships, a comparison must be made between the productive ability of those ports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the opportunity just recently to visit the port of Botany and to speak with representatives of both the stevedoring companies that deal in the port of Botany. They indicated to us that their throughput was just under 20 TEUs. I accept the point that some of the major ports overseas that the honourable member for Shortland alluded to have a much higher throughput rate of TEUs, but the accepted world practice standard should be around 26. It is certainly not impossible to ask that we should be aiming for that target in Australia. I accept that we might not be able to achieve the 30 TEUs that is achieved in Auckland, or the higher amount achieved in some of the ports that the honourable member for Shortland alluded to, but we should be improving on 19. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If it is a fact that the state governments are impeding the more competitive operation of our ports, the Council of Australian Governments should be discussing it. We are talking about a major impact and the impediment to our exporters in this country, not only to manufacturing exporters but also to mining exporters and exporters of primary products. It is a terribly important aspect of Australian industry, a terribly important aspect of our primary industry, and one which this parliament must pay particular attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member indicated that there was an amendment coming from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton), but my understanding is that reference in the legislation to the register is not eliminated, and that is the concern of industry. The industry is arguing that waterfront reform was supposedly a move from industry based agreements to enterprise based agreements. The stevedoring industry does not believe that this bill is going to effect that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 amends the Industrial Relations Act 1988 to abolish special provisions for the stevedoring industry, which have become redundant in the Industrial Relations Act. It also seeks to amend the stevedoring industry levy acts purportedly to reflect changes in the industry. The Minister for Industrial Relations claims that this is following an industry move towards enterprise agreements. But we are saying that we are enshrining some of the pre-reform principles that used to be involved on the waterfront, rather than moving towards enterprise agreements with this amending bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were changes to the composition and function of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, which administers the industry levies, and to confine it to administering only the special levies. These special levies include the Stevedoring Industry Acts (Termination) Act, Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act, Stevedoring Industry Levy Act and the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act. The amendment will also insert sunset clauses in each of the three remaining levy acts so that they are automatically repealed when the SIFC has discharged its remaining obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stevedoring employers oppose this bill. The stevedoring industries are opposing it because, contrary to the assurances of the minister in the House, the amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act would reintroduce an industry register. It will again raise the spectre of industry levies and it will threaten the reintroduction of the industry labour pooling arrangements. This is counter to the entire enterprise thrust of the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A statement issued by the Association of Employers of Waterside Labour indicates that the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 must be amended&mdash;that is, as it is before us&mdash;if it is not to be an instrument for reversing waterfront industry reform in Australia. The offending features of the bill are the plan to provide for maintenance of a register of stevedoring employees; the intention to allow the imposition of additional or increased stevedoring industry levies; and the plan to remove the right of stevedoring employers, through the registered organisation of employers, to nominate the members of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to represent the employers, which seems a little ironic. The minister, in his second reading speech on this bill, with regard to the provision of that register, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision for registers was also relevant in meeting Australia's obligation in relation to ILO convention 137. At the completion of the reform program, all parties agreed that the registration system incorporated in the General Agreement of 1977 would cease to apply. The bill removes the requirement that the committee maintain a register of waterside workers for these purposes and in relation to levy collection, although the committee will establish a register of names of stevedoring employees, consistent with the convention.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we have been criticised by the government for highlighting this point of the government tying this country to international conventions and, in particular, this ILO convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to have a look at which countries are signatories to this ILO convention and which are not and which countries we trade with that are signatories and which are not. I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the signatories to this convention: Afghanistan, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Greece, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania and Uruguay. The countries that have not signed the International Labour Organisation convention 137 are the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Germany, Canada, Russia, the Ukraine, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, South Africa, Nigeria, Brazil, Argentina and Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his No. 1 lieutenant, the Minister for Industrial Relations, have been dressing themselves up as the white knights who are going to lead this country away from being tied to Britain, tugging our forelock to the British, and who want this country to be independent and individual and not commit itself; yet we are continually being reminded about our ties to these international conventions. This is only one convention that is relevant to this particular bill, but it is being used as one of the mainstream arguments for the maintenance of a register as far as this legislation is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister is overseeing the increasing and burgeoning national debt of this country in excess of $200 billion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has us tied up to that many international conventions that every time something comes up in this place we find this nation has been committed to another international convention without reference to this parliament&mdash;a parliament that is representative of the people of Australia. If the opposition in this parliament wants to have any say on these conventions, we have to come to this place and move a disallowance motion. Again, we have heard from all the speakers on the government side on this bill of the use of that international convention as an excuse and a reason why we must maintain that register, which is diametrically opposed to what the waterfront reform was all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the government speakers have also indicated how good we are going on the waterfront. There is no argument that it has certainly improved out of sight. But even the recent OECD report on Australia's performance has indicated that Australia's performance on the waterfront is still only 60 per cent of the OECD average. The government all too often will run off and use statistics produced by the OECD, and the government will put its spin on them when it suits it. But when it does not suit the government the statistics are not correct, they are not relevant&mdash;we are comparing unlike with like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland asked a while ago how we can compare ourselves to major ports like Hong Kong. But on a productivity basis per man per hour we must be able to. The equation used by the OECD indicates that we are operating only at 60 per cent of the OECD average and that the throughput of our container terminals, on the stevedoring companies' admission, is around 19.8 or 20 TEUs. The OECD has indicated that to be world competitive we should have a throughput of about 26 TEUs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stevedoring employees are obviously opposing this bill. They are opposing this bill because it is contrary to the assurances of the minister in the House. The amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act would reintroduce the industry register. It will again raise the spectre of industry levies. It will threaten the reintroduction of industry labour pooling arrangements. This is counter to the entire enterprise thrust of the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is obvious disagreement and continued tension on the waterfront between employer and employee groups. The Maritime Union of Australia continues to believe that waterfront employees should enjoy employment arrangements above and beyond the rest of the Australian work force. That is what this is really all about. Why should one select group in the community enjoy a more privileged position in the industrial relations policies of this nation than any other section of the community? Why should they be different from people who work in other industries? They should not, but again we are seeing the organ-grinders, the particular unions around this country, getting their payback after bankrolling the Labor Party back into government last year. The minister is the monkey dancing to the tune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill is quite clearly the result of successful pressure brought to bear by the Maritime Union of Australia on the federal government so as to operate a statutory regime which is contrary to the basic principles of waterfront reform, which has already been bought and paid for by the taxpayers of this nation for $400-odd million. The MUA maintains that stevedoring employees are entitled to a job for life, except where the MUA agrees otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the feature of the waterfront industry which the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority said ended with its final report in October 1992. But the attitude of the MUA, as clearly demonstrated by the recent stevedores dispute, is clearly unchanged. Notwithstanding all the money that has been spent to buy out the special privileges of the waterfront employees, the MUA still insists on the right of veto over compulsory retrenchments, even when the retrenchment is economically vital to the health of an enterprise or otherwise in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By supporting this bill the federal government is helping the MUA turn back the clocks to the ugly days of excessive union power. Last week one of the speakers&mdash;it was probably the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis)&mdash;challenged members of the opposition to read the judge's statement from the Industrial Relations Commission over that industrial dispute which came about when Australian Stevedores attempted to reduce its work force by 55. It had nothing to do with the conditions that existed. The reason the judge in that case indicated that those people should be reinstated was that Australian Stevedores did not go through the correct procedure in dismissing those men. In my view this is a fairly hollow argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That adds a bit of strength to the concern being shown by employers right across Australia with that same element in the Industrial Relations Bill, which the minister put through the parliament before Christmas in 1993. The onus of proof of unfair dismissal is being put onto the employer rather than the employee. It is a complete turnaround to what has been accepted as the norm where the employee, or the aggrieved person, goes to the Industrial Relations Commission and says, `I have been unfairly dismissed.' It is the norm right throughout common law in Australia that the person who makes the application to the court should be able to prove that he or she has been unfairly dismissed. It is the exact reverse in the industrial relations legislation introduced last year and it was borne out in this case. The reason the judge could instruct Australian Stevedores to reinstate those 55 employees was that the procedure it followed in the dismissal was incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not explained the reasons for the reintroduction of the register. The government has told everyone that it is necessary to meet ILO convention No. 137, which requires the creation of registers for industry pooling arrangements. The industry has indicated the reasons the register should not be there. The register of waterside workers was a feature of the former industry based employment arrangements, the very point the Minister for Industrial Relations was using to sell the Industrial Relations Bill last year&mdash;because of enterprise agreements, not industry agreements. To work in the industry the employee had to be on the register. A registered waterside worker who was idle on a shift was entitled to be paid if available for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Collection of industry levies, which funded this and other industry wide employment obligations, was connected with the use of registered waterside workers. Industries which do not adopt industry employment structures have no need for industry registers of employees. Such registers could have no function. Indeed, a register would be an unnecessary imposition on employers, a potential bar to entry by new employers and an invasion of the privacy of individual employees. There is no future need for a register in the stevedoring industry if it is to have enterprise employment structures rather than industry-wide employment structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maintaining a register when its former purposes have disappeared is contrary to the public interest. Why then is maintenance of a register proposed in clause 20 of the bill? I do not believe the proposed amendment does away with that aspect. If there is no need for a register, there is no need for it to be mentioned anywhere in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maintenance of a register of stevedoring employees is keenly supported by the MUA. The reason the MUA insists on the maintenance of the register is the role it wishes the register to play in helping to enforce the MUA's view that stevedoring employees, unlike other employees in the community, should never be liable to compulsory retrenchment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No plausible explanation has been given by the federal government for allowing the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee the function of recommending new and increased levies. Given the conduct of the MUA during the Australian Stevedores dispute and its attitude with respect to the register, the irresistible conclusion is that the federal government is deliberately leaving the way open for the introduction of funding arrangements sought by the industry to underwrite the cost of port pools for surplus registered stevedoring employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even assuming that this might not be the conscious policy of the federal government, it is the logical consequence of the government's actions and it will leave the government open to the inevitable pressures brought by the MUA to preserve the MUA's crown jewels: jobs for life for stevedoring employees. However, the government has denied the logical consequences of the creation of such a register, which would be a push for a return to pooled labour arrangements and, presumably, some form of general levy. The government is therefore chasing its own tail in the drive for reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no sense in the simple creation of a register. It proves nothing and it solves nothing. The Maritime Union of Australia has already flagged its intentions to return to pooled labour arrangements. It has openly refused to concede individual companies' rights to terminate redundant labour&mdash;that was seen recently&mdash;and therefore the union would almost certainly use the register to try to re-introduce pooled labour arrangements across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The re-creation of the register is inconsistent with the stated purpose of the winding up of the SIFC. In fulfilment of the federal government's micro-economic reform policy in the waterfront to date, employers have contributed $255 million and the federal government&mdash;the taxpayers&mdash;has contributed $165 million. This money has been spent in funding the special redundancy and early retirement program recommended by the Inter-State Commission and adopted by the in-principle agreement designed to see 3,000 stevedoring employees leave the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employers' contribution is funded by way of a statutory industry levy. Of course, in the long run it is the Australian consumer and the exporter that bears the great bulk of this cost either through taxation or higher consumer prices. The federal government now appears to be cooperating in a reversal of policy on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By persisting in its present course, the government leaves the way open for the Maritime Union of Australia to press for industry based solutions in respect of surplus labour and the imposition of new levies to fund that surplus labour. This should alarm anybody concerned to see the apparent gains from micro-economic reform on the waterfront not squandered. Minister Brereton has misled the parliament on this issue. He told parliament on 23 March that any decision to reintroduce a register would not be made by him. He claimed that the Australian Stevedoring Finance Committee will be making the decision. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill was proposed to achieve a number of purposes: firstly, to secure the stevedoring industry levy collection arrangements, incorporating the abolition of the general levy and continuation of the special levy with respect to the financing of the redundancies that the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) has referred to; secondly, to restructure the functions of the Australian Stevedoring Finance Committee; and, thirdly, to abolish a variety of obsolete arrangements with respect to industrial relations that are specific to that industry. In order to do this, there are amendments to various acts of parliament relating specifically to the stevedoring industry and also to the Industrial Relations Act itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a wide range of reform on the waterfront during the period that this government has been in office, particularly under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority which was established by the Labor government. Widespread reform has emerged from a reform program negotiated between the ACTU and the government to apply for a three-year period from 1989 to 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new award for the industry called the Stevedoring Industry Award was negotiated, and that was ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission in November 1991. That new award replaced roughly 17 awards that previously applied in the stevedoring industry. It brought multiskilling into the industry. A new classification of stevedoring employee replaced the previous award classification of waterside worker. As a result of these changes, a number of organisations, including my own former organisation, ceased to have a role in the waterfront industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the introduction of multiskilling, even though the Federated Clerks Union still represented a significant number of waterside workers&mdash;namely tally clerks and clerical workers&mdash;it became apparent that it would be against the interests of those workers for us to seek to separately represent them any further. That would have denied them access to the benefits of multiskilling, of which there are a number, and it would have denied them access to career paths that were set out in the structure of the new award. Therefore, our organisation withdrew from that area and negotiated arrangements to hand over the rights of representation to the Waterside Workers Federation, which is now part of the Maritime Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite that as an example of how cooperation with government, the various unions involved&mdash;there is now one union&mdash;and, at least to some extent employers, has achieved a great deal on Australia's waterfront over the past five or six years. I think this contrasts fairly starkly with the record of the previous coalition government in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and other opposition speakers in this debate have claimed that this legislation will bring back pooled labour and that the recent shift to company labour will be reversed. As has been stated by previous speakers in the debate, that is not the case. There are quite explicit and straightforward reasons why the register will be maintained in a particular form as a result of this legislation. Clearly, that does not relate to any suggested reintroduction of pooled labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government, the work force on the waterfront has been reduced by 57 per cent and productivity has increased by roughly 60 per cent. The ship turnaround time has more or less halved. Container handling rates are now on a par with the most efficient ports overseas. We now have a single award rather than a multiplicity of awards. The rates that are charged for stevedoring services are now 20 to 30 per cent lower than they were previously. Given the change that has occurred in productivity and the amount of labour involved, one might ask why that change has not been greater. I recommend that the honourable member for Lyne examine other parts of the waterfront industry to explore some of the issues he has dealt with, instead of pursuing the typical coalition approach of blaming the workers and the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, very little was achieved by the previous coalition government in this area. What the Labor government has achieved has been with the cooperation of the union. Given how difficult it is for any union to accept loss of jobs for its members and to accept a reduction in work opportunities for the people it represents, great credit must be paid to the Maritime Union of Australia&mdash;and previously the Waterside Workers Federation&mdash;for the fact that it has contributed to this process in the way that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are in part necessary because employers have not been quite as cooperative in a process that they and their representatives in here say is so important. In particular, they have been less than cooperative in paying the levies that are required to fund the redundancies from the waterfront work force. It is ironic to see representatives of the coalition standing up in the House today and last week attacking the level of cooperation from the union in this matter when the union and the work force have been remarkably cooperative. It is the companies that, in some instances, have dragged the chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register is being maintained to ensure that Australia continues to comply with ILO convention 137 dealing with dock work. This convention was ratified by Australia in 1974 and requires that a register be maintained as a basis for permanent employment and also as a basis for dealing with a variety of other matters such as occupational health and safety, training and similar matters related to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a debatable point whether Australia needs to maintain a register in order to comply with the convention. But, in my submission, the better view is that we should maintain the register in order to ensure that we do comply. We have heard a few sneering references from one or two speakers on the other side about the countries that have ratified this convention as compared with those countries that have not. We hear that the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile and Argentina are examples of countries that have not ratified. The tone of the voices opposite indicates that the countries that have ratified are mickey mouse nations of no great consequence internationally. Yet these include such great maritime nations as Sweden and Greece, which have histories with respect to the maritime industry that are out of all proportion to the size of their population and their economies. So I suggest that some of the sneers that have come from the other side with respect to the list of countries that have ratified this particular convention are misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention is not inconsistent with enterprise or company based employment. It is quite clear that the former role that the register played in the controlling of access to employment on the waterfront will not continue and will play a different role. What is surfacing here is the opposition's paranoia about international conventions, treaties and the like and, in particular, the use of the external affairs power, which comes under section 51(xxxv) of the Australian constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again in the past few years the argument has been put forward that Australia is losing sovereignty to gangs of faceless United Nations bureaucrats and that the parliament is losing sovereignty. The facts are these: in order for any convention or any treaty to which we become party to have any impact at all in Australia, legislation must be passed by this parliament. It has to be ratified first. The honourable member for Lyne is quite correct when he says that the process for the opposition challenging ratification requires moving for disallowance. But to have any practical effect in Australia, any convention has to be legislated and put into law by the government and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some extraordinary misconceptions in the community. I have cited this example in this place previously. Max Walsh, a journalist, stated that, as a result of the new Industrial Relations Act depending upon ILO conventions, whenever those conventions change, the Australian legislation will automatically change. That is absolute nonsense. Any changes that occur to ILO conventions must first be ratified by countries that have already ratified the substantive convention. Then, if those countries choose to&mdash;and Australia may or may not choose to&mdash;they are put into the legislation by an amendment to the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real underlying issue in all of this is xenophobia. It is the old hoary chestnut of states rights. It is the Liberals and the National Party trying to preserve archaic and oppressive laws in some of the states that they control from time to time and trying to ensure that the national parliament is unable to legislate on national issues that have an importance way beyond the role they may play in one particular state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution contains an external affairs power precisely for this reason. As we internationalise, as more and more activities require international regulatory action, whether they involve environmental issues, Labor issues or economic issues, or combined efforts by many nations, it is logical to expect that the external affairs power will be invoked more by this parliament in order to give effect to those international actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have the extraordinary spectacle of the conservatives in Australian politics undermining the institution of the High Court, the rule of law&mdash;something that they supposedly stand for. We did not hear them undermining the High Court back in the 1950s when Sir Owen Dixon ruled supreme and we had the strict literalist interpretation of section 92 which meant that sensible, ordinary government regulation of a variety of activities was undermined or destroyed because of an extreme literal interpretation of that section of the constitution. We did not hear them complain then about the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not hear them complain in the 1970s about the Barwick High Court, when tax avoiders were given carte blanche to effectively completely avoid the taxation laws and ensure that there was one law for the rich and another for the poor. It was then optional to pay income tax. There were no complaints from the Liberals then about the High Court and no suggestion that the High Court was making legislation or in some way supervening the role of the parliament. Now that the High Court is taking a position that the Liberals do not like, it is a different story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with most issues, the opposition has a class position. This is particularly apparent with respect to this legislation. At the end of the day, the opposition's stance on this issue boils down to the fact that it does not like wharfies. The reason is that some of the great formative battles of the Labor movement have been fought and won by waterside workers. They have battled casual employment, favouritism, victimisation, enormous health and safety issues&mdash;back injuries, industrial deafness or, more recently, the implications of handling asbestos such as asbestos related diseases. We have had repressive legislation such as the infamous dog collar act in 1928 of the Bruce government, formed from predecessors of the Liberal Party. So ultimately this is about a class position by the conservative forces: they do not like waterside workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is accepted that reform has been necessary and that the enthusiasm of the conservative forces contrasts strongly with their relative inaction when in office. The Labor government has been able to implement reform without disruption and without having to call in the army or do any of the other types of things that are sometimes called for by people on the other side of the political spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne referred to the recent Australian Stevedores dispute and tried to suggest that wharfies in some way regard themselves as being special or having greater rights than other workers. I suggest to the opposition that various groups of people in this community regard themselves in that way&mdash;none of them is a trade unionist and many of them earn in the vicinity of $150,000 to $200,000 a year. Certainly, waterside workers are not in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out for the information of the honourable member for Lyne that the core issue in that dispute with Australian Stevedores was the victimisation of a large number of union delegates&mdash;almost half of the 55 people proposed for compulsory redundancy were union delegates. That was the core issue. That is something that has been avoided by the opposition; it is something that is a day-to-day reality for most unions, even in industrially strong areas such as the waterfront. That was the critical issue at stake in that dispute. It is misleading to ignore that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the general matter of the recent unfair dismissal legislation, which was adverted to by the honourable member for Lyne in his comments. This legislation has been talked up by both employer organisations and the opposition into such a hysterical wave of terror that I believe there are employers out there now who are genuinely worried about taking on more people because they fear the implications of this legislation&mdash;not because of anything contained within the legislation but because of the incredible hysteria that has been generated by employer organisations and the opposition. Their hysteria is likely to become a force that prevents employment, in exactly the same way that the opposition says the legislation is in some way inhibiting employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media have had some entertainment talking up some of the initial claims that have been lodged&mdash;claims of up to $1 million. Anybody can make a claim saying, `I would like compensation of $500,000, $1 million or $2 million,' but it would be appropriate to reserve judgment on the new system and wait to see what happens with the judging of those claims by the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my short period as a lawyer, I had cause to deal occasionally with county court writs, which certainly at that time in Melbourne, in the jurisdiction of Victoria, always carried a $100,000 claim at the top&mdash;even if a person was suing for something that was relatively minor and would never be within a bull's roar of $100,000. Invariably, people who were being sued would get that writ and say, `Oh, my goodness, I am being sued for $100,000.' It was meaningless&mdash;a mere form. The same thing applies with respect to some of the more spectacular claims that have been lodged in the unfair dismissal jurisdiction. Time will tell whether we see large payouts and whether we see unfair cost burdens imposed on employers. If experience is any guide in the unfair dismissal jurisdictions both in the states and previously in the federal arena, these results will be very rare indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core issue that the opposition is missing is that no-one can be dismissed unfairly. The requirements of the legislation are very straightforward. If employers want to dismiss somebody for poor performance, they will need to demonstrate that there has been some form of previous counselling, that their poor performance has previously been drawn to their attention, that an attempt has been made to fix the problem and that they have not just been turfed arbitrarily. If employers want to dismiss somebody for misconduct, they will have to have some evidence. If employers wish to dismiss an employee for stealing, they cannot do that on the basis of a rumour or on the basis of a whim; they will have to have some solid evidence to demonstrate that that employee stole from the company. If employers wish to dismiss somebody in other circumstances and discrimination is involved, they will have a case to answer about whether that person is pregnant, or of a particular race, colour, creed or whatever. These are all legitimate issues on which people are entitled to justice and on which they will now get it on a universal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about this particular form of legislation is that issues of jurisdiction which have dogged the unfair dismissal system throughout this country for many years will now be avoided. Hours and hours of debate and litigation have occurred in the past, which has meant that, in some instances, cases have gone on for three or four years without people getting justice. That will all be avoided. Questions of interstate jurisdiction and whether people fall within a particular award or not&mdash;matters that have caused immense difficulties for people seeking simple justice on their dismissal&mdash;will now be avoided. That is something the government deserves great credit for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps we can draw some sinister conclusions from the opposition's desire to get rid of that legislation. It will at least get some equity and some fairness into the employment relationship and allow people who have been unfairly dismissed to genuinely pursue their entitlements and to have some hope of getting some sort of justice. If high fliers end up exploiting the system and getting excessive payouts, there will be a case for us to review how the system is operating. But let us wait and see exactly what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's position is basically that it opposes justice for workers and reforms that are designed to ensure there is some fairness in the employment relationship. Its opposition to this legislation, as I have indicated, has its origins in its basic distaste and dislike for waterside workers, who have been the core, the strength and the vanguard of the Labor movement in its battle for justice in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In concluding the second reading debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill I thank those government members who have participated in what has been a very stimulating debate on a piece of legislation that we see as being necessary to facilitate a continuation of the waterfront reform process. Government member after government member has taken the opportunity of speaking in the debate. I thank each and every one for their contributions. I think it can rightly be said that they overwhelmed the contributions put forward by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take a few moments to reply to some of the matters that were brought forward by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) in their contributions to the debate. What needs to be understood at the outset is that this legislation underpins the waterfront reform process. That is a process which in itself has already seen dramatic improvement both in waterfront productivity and in the general level of enterprise employment on the waterfront. It has been against that background that opposition members have come into this chamber in the course of the debate and have sought quite mischievously to misrepresent the purpose of the bill. I do not think a simple little piece of legislation has been so misrepresented for yonks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation simply ensures the collection of the special levy which partially finances the redundancy program which has already reduced the labour force on the Australian waterfront by 57 per cent&mdash;a 57 per cent reduction which has seen a saving of nearly $250 million per annum in wages and on-costs. One would think that opposition members would have been coming into the parliament to say what a marvellous achievement waterfront reform represents, when we have those sorts of statistics. But no, instead they have sought to misrepresent the purpose of this bill which, as I have indicated to the House, is simply to ensure that the collection of the special levy continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is not aimed at creating labour pools or at seeing a move away from enterprise employment. The opposition has said repeatedly in the debate that it will create labour pools, but that is arrant nonsense; it will not have that effect at all. It is the government's policy, as we have said over and over again, to adhere to ILO conventions. Before government reports to the ILO on its observance of conventions we take the time to seek the views of the ACTU as well as the peak employer organisation, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, on those conventions. I am advised by the department that at no stage whatsoever has the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry raised objections to the ILO 137 in reports to the ILO to date. It has not been at issue. One would think it was the biggest issue in the world from some of the things that have been said by the opposition in this debate. But it has been so much a non-event that it has not been raised by way of objection from ACCI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ILO 137 does not hinder productivity. That is not its purpose and that is certainly not its effect. The government's approach on ILO 137 is to allow the use of time and wages records or other relevant records, that is, the existing records, the records that are available under the Industrial Relations Act. What this means in practicality is that the adherence to ILO convention 137 using those existing time and wages records and the other relevant records is as simple as possible&mdash;unbelievably simple, in fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong did not compare like with like in his contribution to this debate when he compared Australian and New Zealand waterfront costs and reforms. The five to 10 per cent figures he refers to are derived from a Bureau of Transport and Communication economics report for the period 1991 to 1992. Those figures are for total costs, including road transport and brokers' fees. If the honourable member wants to come into the parliament he ought to commit himself to comparing like with like, apples with apples, or, in this charge, real port costs with real port costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New Zealand figures that he has used are for a totally different period. They are understood to be a combination of stevedoring and some port authority charges. This is clearly not a case of like being compared with like. The honourable member for Bennelong should know better than to so misrepresent the purpose and the effect of this legislation, as he has done repeatedly during this debate. Clearly and demonstrably on the facts of the matter the comparison he makes is not valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the contribution of the honourable member for Hume. I told the House not once but indeed on two occasions&mdash;let me reiterate it both for his benefit and for the House's benefit&mdash;that this bill does not herald the reintroduction of pool employment nor, as he put it to the House, jobs for life. It does not do either of those things. He and the honourable member for Bennelong referred to the TEU loading rates in Sydney and in Melbourne. Their source for this was apparently an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> article of 17 February 1994. The source of that article was one shipping line's internal working paper. What neither gentleman bothered to tell the House, what they both omitted to tell the House, was that the very same <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> went on to say that other operators and shipping organisations had taken issue with that report, had disagreed with it. Throughout the period they referred to the average container handling rates remaining at 20 TEUs per hour; average handling rates did not fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hume did not end there; he also claimed that the committee would not close down and would continue, to quote him, `for goodness knows how long'. If only he had read the bill he would see the government's commitment to a sunset provision to ensure that each stevedoring act is repealed when the committee's functions have been fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, in summing up: never has a piece of legislation been so generously misrepresented for reasons of base political motivation and in this bill by both the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Hume. It is a thoroughly reasonable measure, one necessary to guarantee, as I have said to the House, that this levy continues to be collected. I warmly commend it to the House and to honourable members. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to follow up on the answer that the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) gave to a question in question time today where he set about to insult the people of western Victoria when not once but twice in the answer he referred to Warrnambool as the western district of Melbourne&mdash;a fact that I find particularly insulting given that Warrnambool is 300 kilometres west of Melbourne. For him to not even realise, despite my reminder during his answer to the question, that he was in fact some distance from Melbourne seems extraordinary. This lack of understanding really represents the present Labor government's problems when it talks about regional Australia&mdash;in this case regional Victoria. It really does not seem to understand. But I would like to go a bit further than that and give honourable members a little bit more of an insight into what their esteemed colleague had to say and how it was reported in Warrnambool's local paper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Standard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;a very good paper.</PARA></TALK.START>

In a report that appeared on page 7 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Standard</EMPHASIS> on Saturday an opinion was offered&mdash;and I would like to share it with all honourable members because I think they would be very interested, particularly those on the other side, to know how their Deputy Prime Minister is received when he leaves this place and goes out into the real world in western Victoria. The article reports:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second most senior politician in Australia came to Warrnambool yesterday . . . Mr Howe's attendance came hot on the heels of Prime Minister Paul Keating's announcement on Wednesday of the Government's plans to stimulate 560,000 jobs as part of a forward-reaching . . . program.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If yesterday's audience was looking for motivation, they would have found it easier to fall asleep.</PARA>
<PARA>Government members should take note. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they wanted direction, Mr Howe guided them nowhere. If they sought insight into the Government's plans for the district, they might as well have stayed at home and read the white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Howe repeated much of what Mr Keating had already outlined. He spoke of the `challenge to regional Australia' and `driving the engine of growth'. It was pure political hot air.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought all honourable members could learn a little bit from that; it is pertinent that they see just how the Deputy Prime Minister's comments are received when he goes out into the real world&mdash;out into the Western District of Victoria, not the western district of Melbourne. It is also rather pertinent to note that at that same conference I raised a question at the end of his speech in relation to what I think are some of the real issues facing regional Australia: whether or not the government is going to do something about one of the major cost impediments for regional Australia&mdash;transport. I pointed out to him the fact that transport operators in the area are finding it rather difficult because the amount of tax they have to pay is a very large percentage of what their operating costs are and, as a consequence, the cost of transport has to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel tax has been increased yet again, and will be going up again in August. The government talks about its concern for regional Australia. It shows its concern by going on taxing road transport, which for most of regional Australia is the only transport they have, and taxing the cost of travel. Most people have to use a private motor car because they have nothing else and they do not have subsidised public transport to cart them around. The government's concern is grossly overrated&mdash;in fact, I think it is rather hypocritical because on the one hand it is raising taxes all the time to make sure the cost for people living in the country is going up and then it comes along with this so-called great statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind all honourable members that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Standard</EMPHASIS> described Mr Howe's speech as `pure political hot air'. It sums up the reaction of people in regional Australia to what has really been a damp squib, and a statement that is going to disappear as quickly as have previous statements from this government when it has talked about what it would do to help the unemployed and help, in particular, those people who are trying to carve out a living in regional Australia despite all the difficulties that the government continues to impose on them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 October last year I supported the private member's motion of my colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) calling for the government to allocate more money for breast cancer research. Momentum and awareness has built up in the community as breast cancer has received increasing attention in the media. I have often been moved and saddened when listening to individual women speak of their own experience with breast cancer. I felt sheer elation when the subject of breast cancer hit the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, when the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> devoted an editorial to the subject, and when the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs heard evidence on the management and treatment of breast cancer. In my electorate all four television channels covered the inquiry. At long last a silent epidemic, which has been tagged `the lady killer', was receiving the attention it deserved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) launched the breast cancer lobby for life campaign, the community joined in. People with varying political loyalties signed petitions seeking more funding for breast cancer research. In excess of 10,000 signatures have come through my office. I place on the record my thanks to the women's groups, bowling clubs, concerned individuals, health professionals, and medical couriers, who assisted me to collect the signatures that I have brought to this House. There have been a few critics&mdash;one wishing I would give equal attention to prostate cancer&mdash;and there have been arguments that it would be a tragedy if politicians tried to dictate the National Health and Medical Research Council agenda. In reply to these criticisms, there are a number of points I wish to make. I quote the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of last October when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting this motion I am not arguing for sectional interest and I do not suggest that less should be spent on other areas of medical research. We should not reallocate existing resources but rather increase Australia's overall investment in medical research. The fact is that Australia's investment in medical research is too low irrespective of what parameters we examine&mdash;1.4 per cent of the total health expenditure when that internationally accepted minimum is 2 per cent. We need to come to see research as an integral component of our health care services. The primary goal of health and medical research must be to achieve better health for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>It can also be argued that when research into heart disease was increased and a public awareness campaign mounted, the outcomes were favourable: deaths from heart disease are now decreasing while deaths from breast cancer are increasing. There is also the reality that politicians are elected to represent their electorates and to be advocates. I have received enormous encouragement from women and men to highlight this issue. We need to see medical research not only as laboratory research but also as clinical evaluation&mdash;that is, evaluation of treatment. If data is not accurately collected and examined, there can be no outcome analysis. While there is an open chequebook through Medicare rebates for diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, clinical evaluation is hampered, or in some areas non-existent, because of a lack of research dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently a well-known breast cancer researcher in South Australia received a grant from the United States. This grant was from resources reserved for Third World countries. The grant was to research breast cancer in Aboriginal women, and Australia qualified for it because of the low expenditure on health research as a percentage of GDP. Tomorrow night many Australians will be listening to the budget to hear if there will be a significant increase in funding for medical research. Will the funding be closer to the internationally accepted minimum, or will our researchers still be eligible for grants on Third World criteria?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just received a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Radio Australia</EMPHASIS> news summary which has been authenticated because it essentially comes from Sean Dorney, who many of us would know is a reporter in Papua New Guinea. It reports:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of Bougainville's senior statesman, Sir Paul Lapun, has been beaten up in his village . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to report that his house was burned down and his wife and daughter were also beaten up, all on the basis that the parliamentary delegation, of which I was a member, a couple of weeks ago handed him over 30,000 in either kina or dollars. The rebels believed he had that amount, they sought that amount from him, and in some way, apparently, he has been penalised as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Paul was for 10 years the representative for South Bougainville in the PNG parliament. He was the minister responsible for mines in one of the Somare governments, and it was really through him as much as anybody that the rights to the mineral wealth of Papua New Guinea were retained for local landowners. I find it very regrettable that this should have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to say three things. Firstly, on behalf of all Australians, to Sir Paul and his family we extend our deep sympathy and trust for his speedy recovery. He is a very senior statesman and a wonderful man, and I think that all of us who know him feel very sad about it, as I know my colleague the shadow minister for foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I say to those who are rebels and who are shooting people and bashing them up that, for goodness sake, they are not going to get any of their political views accepted or registered in a legitimate way if they persist in killing people and acting in this totally lawless fashion. The more they behave like that, the less they are likely to be listened to by anybody. Indeed, when they behave in such a way against somebody who has contributed so much to his country and to the South Pacific and who is regarded highly by people of all sides of politics, the less they are going to be seen as having any claim at all to the cause which they purport to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I say that any suggestion that the parliamentary delegation handed over money to anybody is totally false and that those who purport to represent the so-called Bougainville Revolutionary Army should have enough commonsense to understand that we were there in a totally apolitical fashion to try to secure if we could some basis of reconciliation between the warring parties. We certainly gave no money to anybody and the suggestion that Sir Paul might have received this incredible amount of 30,000 kina or dollars from us is total fancy and needs to be seen and heard in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much regret the incident and trust that&mdash;in the nature of the discussions we had after our delegation with Prime Minister Wingti and other members of his government, including the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Police and the Chief of the Defence Force&mdash;there might be a chance to withdraw from fighting and find a peaceful settlement to what is a very important problem. Obviously, the delegation will be making a formal report to this parliament within the next few weeks, but I wanted to rise expressly to say to Sir Paul and his family how sad I was to hear of this incident and to assure him that, from our point of view, he is regarded very highly. I also wanted to say to those who committed this appalling act against him that, frankly, they are losing all respect and they certainly have no basis whatsoever for any sympathy when they behave in this fashion. </PARA>

On the Saturday night I also attended the Royal Flying Doctor Service ball, the 500 tickets to which were sold out in eight  minutes. It goes to show something of the spirit of the west, even in these difficult times, to support a worthy cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the highlight of my weekend was receiving a petition from Jenny Camilleri and Anne Slater asking for greater funds for breast cancer research and for other things associated with breast cancer. I handed in petitions from 5,600 petitioners today, 4,500 of which came from Broken Hill, which must surely be the highest amount per capita in Australia presented in this parliament. There are no screening facilities in western New South Wales. There is a New South Wales program overseen by the cancer council, and there have been announcements on the progress of that in recent days. The aim of that program is to reduce deaths in the target group by 30 per cent by the year 2001. About one in 12 women contract a breast abnormality at some stage of their lives. The last figures I had for New South Wales showed that 2,400 new cases of some abnormality turn up every year and that approximately 900 women die every year. So, if this program were fully under way, we could eliminate about 220 deaths per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the New South Wales program, the state is divided into 16 regions, and the screening and treatment is already up and running in many areas. While one woman across Australia is dying every four hours from breast cancer, nothing has been done as yet in the Orana and far west region and the central west region, which is Bathurst, Dubbo and Orange, west and north. It is intended when these screening units are fully going that they push through between 5,000 and 10,000 women a year. This will be done free instead of women paying $78 each. The target group is specifically the 50-69 year age group, although women as young as 40 and up to 79 years of age will also be screened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, assessment centres have to be set up and I believe Dubbo has a good chance of having one set up. In these, we will have specialised radiologists, people who can use ultrasound, histopathologists, cytopathologists, specialised surgeons, counsellors and also administrative and data management staff. I welcome the announcement over the weekend that Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange will be receiving screening units. I guess the doctors will probably fly over the area of the west of Bourke, Brewarrina, Cobar, Parkes, Forbes and other towns like this, but I am very concerned that the far western towns will miss out altogether. The Orana and far west region, including even Dubbo, has something less than 35 per cent of the number of women than the average of the other 15 areas in the state. So, taking into account the low numbers, the massive distances involved&mdash;the hundreds of kilometres between towns&mdash;and also the reality that the target percentage of women screened will be lower because of less awareness of the importance of screening and the high Aboriginal population out there, nothing like 5,000 women will go through these screening units in a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to have criteria for these screening units, I believe they have to be relaxed for the western areas. I believe the women of the west have been neglected in this area for far too long. There is a great case to put a screening unit in Broken Hill. It would remain there for a few months of the year and then go out to far-flung towns like Tibooburra, White Cliffs, Wilcannia, Menindee, Ivanhoe and these types of towns where women receive health services only from a royal flying doctor, where there is a high Aboriginal population in some areas and where people who live out there do not even have electricity connected. Surely the very least we can do is provide these women with the same service that exists in larger centres like Sydney. I believe the guidelines should be extended and the women of the west should get a fair crack of the whip for the first time for a long time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are our federal representative we are asking for your help in our support of ATSIC retaining responsibility for the Land Acquisition Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have talked to aboriginal people and communities in the region many of whom are concerned about the Land Acquisition Fund being handled by a new government department other than ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is concern that Mr Keating is supporting the Kimberley Land Council as the representative body of aboriginal people in the Kimberley. The Kimberley Land Council does not speak for us, they have no mandate to speak for the people of the Kimberley.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC was formed to handle monies for aboriginal people and we can see no sense in creating another government body to handle aboriginal funding. We do not want Mr Keating to form a new department to handle the Land Acquisition Fund, we want ATSIC to handle the Land Acquisition Fund.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dickey Cox</PARA>
<PARA>That letter should not be taken as an endorsement of ATSIC. The same people in the Kimberley Aboriginal Association have been very critical of ATSIC in the past. But they believe that, with the advent of new commissioners, such as Glenys Sibosado and Charlie Perkins, ATSIC can be made to be more representative. Certainly it is far more representative than the land councils. I know that the Kimberley Land Council represents no-one but its own self-interest. It has no mandate to speak for Aboriginals, despite the fact that it is reported ad nauseam by the ABC and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> and it seems to have the ear of both political parties in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When the structure of the Kimberley Land Council is looked at, it becomes quite clear that all its paid employees are white people and that it runs a very political agenda. It is quite clear to me that the Aboriginal people overwhelmingly support Mr Cox and his Aboriginal association, despite the fact that these people attract no funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is quite true that ATSIC cannot fund these bodies because they are not federally incorporated. But I do not believe that there is any great will to fund them in any case, because they know that this is truly the grassroots voice of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that the people who purport to legislate in the name of Aboriginal people&mdash;the people who are responsible for spending vast sums of money in the name of Aboriginal people which do not get to the grassroots level and which do not do what they are supposed to do&mdash;started to listen to these people. Overwhelmingly, these people want a fair go. It is quite clear that they are not getting it. They do not blame the white society; they blame the administration set up in their name which they know is unrepresentative of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I do not believe that my representations in this House will make much difference. I have a copy of a letter on my files sent to Mr Cox by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) saying that because of the complexity of Mabo and the distance involved in Western Australia the government has decided to consult only the Aboriginal Legal Service, the Kimberley Land Council and ATSIC. I could argue that two of these bodies are not representative and elected and that one other&mdash;ATSIC&mdash;is only marginally so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear&mdash;these are only words&mdash;that no attempt was made at consultation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday, 28 April, I had the pleasure of attending the official opening of Callide Coalfields new $80 million dragline at Biloela in Central Queensland, which is part of my electorate of Hinkler. The state-of-the-art Indresco 8750 dragline is one of the largest mining machines of its type in the world. In fact, at 130 metres in length, it boasts the longest boom in the world. Moving at a speed of 0.2 kilometres per hour, this walking leviathan can remove 80 cubic metres of overburden with one swoop of its enormous bucket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dragline's opening, which was part of a total of $100 million expansion by Callide Coalfields Pty Ltd, was a particularly special occasion marking 50 years of operation of the mine. Callide Coalfields has pioneered a remarkable development over the last 100 years. Discovered in 1890 by three prospectors, Callide's rich `black gold' was at that time the thickest coal seam discovered in Australia. Over the next 50 years, Callide attracted the interest of many investors with little result, until in 1943 the Brisbane accountant Lawrence Neill changed the destiny of the fledgling mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1944, when Theiss Brothers were contracted to remove the overburden and expose the coal, the development of the mine as an open-cut operation mine took off. From a mere 100 tonnes or so production in that year, the mine grew quickly, so that by 1952 Theiss Holdings Ltd owned and operated the whole Callide lease, producing 350,000 tonnes. Callide remained in the Theiss family for almost 30 years, during which time the mine implemented significant advancements in mining technology, including the commissioning of a BE1350 walking dragline in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1980, CSR Ltd took over the Callide mine along with joint venturers Shell and AMP, marking a new expansion era with the discovery and mining of new deposits within the Callide seam, including the opening further north of the Boundary Hill mine in 1982. Today, Callide Coalfields Pty Ltd manages two coalmines, Callide and Boundary Hill, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell Australia on behalf of the joint venturers Shell and AMP. This latest expansion reinforces Shell's position as the major investor in our state and national economies.

The new electric power dragline at the Callide mine and the refurbishment and relocation of the BE1350 dragline to Boundary Hill, plus improvements as part of this expansion, will see coal production increase from four million tonnes to six million tonnes over the next five years. Through the past 50 years, Callide Coalfields has been a strong and reliable supplier of quality coal for the Queensland economy. The major customers are the Queensland Electricity Commission's Callide B power station at Biloela, Queensland Alumina in Gladstone and the Gladstone Joint Power Venture, which recently acquired the Gladstone power station. The sale of the Gladstone power station is a key element in the expansion of the Boyne smelter to one of the world's largest aluminium smelters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe that the House should adjourn until I have had an opportunity to pay a tribute to the constituents and residents of the district of Sunraysia in the northern part of my electorate. Sunraysia is a well-known horticultural region. It has been recognised in the white paper as producing $200 million per annum in export earnings. It is quite fitting that the government has recognised that this district is an example of a regional development centre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not underestimate the visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to that part of my electorate last Friday. I thank him for his visit, particularly given that he arrived with his cheque book ready to make a capital investment in the area of $2.55 million, which is to be matched by the state government of Victoria. That means that, over the next three years, the district of Sunraysia will have the opportunity for investment of $5.1 million. On behalf of the community of Sunraysia, I thank the government for recognising that this part of rural Australia has a role to play in the wealth creation of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sunraysia represents what is typically the character of all people who live in rural Australia. My electorate covers three strong regions similar to Sunraysia, including the Swan Hill region and the Wimmera. I make a plea that the government continue to give such recognition to people who have done it hard over the years and who have suffered because of their isolation. It is this drive and resilience that causes them to act as a strong community, which has been recognised in Sunraysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In thanking the government for its attention to this part of my electorate, I place a challenge before the other regions of my electorate, particularly the Wimmera, to look upon this as an example to follow. If they can rise to the challenge of being self-motivated and self-help oriented, they too can benefit from this new focus towards regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that in his visit to Sunraysia the Prime Minister heard the people's concern that imposts such as fuel excise on their business inputs are a major cost impediment on conducting their businesses and an impediment on employing the young people of the area. I hope the Prime Minister heard the concerns of the business community of Sunraysia and came back to this place on the weekend and made some adjustments to what might be presented to us tomorrow in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community of Sunraysia requires the government to get off its back, to free up the excessive regulation&mdash;payroll tax, the training guarantee levy, and all the other paperwork&mdash;that is necessary to simply employ someone these days. I hope the Prime Minister heard the Sunraysia community's concerns about the new Industrial Relations Reform Act, which is creating uncertainty for those with a desire to employ but who have some reservations about doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the Prime Minister heard that the Sunraysia community wants this government to get its hands out of its pockets, to get its hands out of the tills of the businesses of Sunraysia, and that the community wants the costs of running business reduced. In tomorrow's budget that community will be looking for genuine reform, genuine attempts to reduce the deficit and to reduce that pressure which is causing rises in interest rates because it does not want to see the high interest rates of the mid-1980s that have crippled many of the businesses in Sunraysia. I welcome the government's attention. I thank the Prime Minister for his visit and for the challenge it has created for the other strong regional areas in my electorate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Runway capacity is normally expressed in terms of peak hour capacity or practical annual capacity. Peak hour capacity is the maximum number of aircraft movements that can be handled in one hour. For a particular airport it depends on a range of factors including runway configuration, airspace management arrangements, prevailing weather conditions, aircraft mix and environmental factors. Practical annual capacity is the number of annual movements corresponding to an acceptable level of average delay. An annual average delay of 4 minutes is the widely accepted criterion for defining practical annual capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of aircraft movements over a 24 hour period is not used as a measure of runway capacity. In Australia at least, demand is never sustained for all hours of the day and constraints such as curfews limit access during certain hours in any case. Therefore, the number of movements over 24 hours is not a meaningful concept in measuring capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) advises that the peak hour capacities (aircraft movements per hour) for the airports mentioned are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Sydney Airport</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Note that the figures represent the maximum capacity available under the various operating situations. The achievement of these capacities in practice requires optimum conditions, including constant demand (ie aircraft waiting to take-off and land), during the period. For 1993, the actual aircraft movement rate averaged 57 during the morning peak hour.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Capacity is not allocated to different categories of operations as suggested. However, the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) applies a peak period surcharge at Sydney Airport during the morning and afternoon peaks in an attempt to encourage use of capacity outside the hours of high aircraft activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The incidence of demand exceeding capacity is essentially confined to peak periods at Sydney Airport, particularly when the available hourly capacity is limited by poor weather conditions. Although airlines would not normally schedule levels of traffic above the maximum available capacity, it has been common practice to schedule several departures and arrivals either concurrently or within a very short interval. This practice of cluster scheduling normally results in delays to aircraft since the runway systems cannot accommodate multiple operations at the one time. However, the Australian Air Transport Association, representing Qantas and Ansett Airlines, has advised that action has been taken in recent months to improve demand management at Sydney Airport, including the reduction of cluster scheduling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Questions regarding the referral of matters to the Trade Practices Commission should be directed to the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The FAC has advised that it believes that the introduction of higher landing and departure fees at designated peak times has reduced the number of requests for scheduled departures and arrivals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The FAC advises that it does not keep track of individual airline activities. However, the FAC has advised that prior to the introduction of peak period pricing on 1 April 1989, there were, on average, 15 general aviation movements between 0800 and 0900 on weekdays, whereas now there are an average of only 2 movements in this period. Similarly, before peak period pricing was extended to regular passenger transport movements on 1 January 1991, there were, on average, 18 intrastate airline movements between 0800 and 0900 on weekdays. This number has now fallen to around 11 movements in the same period. Peak period pricing appears to have had little effect on the number of movements by interstate and international aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The introduction of the peak period surcharge has had the desired effect of initially reducing demand during peak periods and subsequently keeping demand below the levels anticipated in the absence of peak period pricing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The figure of $380,000 appears to be based on the total number of Job Search Allowance (JSA) and Newstart Allowance (NSA) clients being paid by the Byron Bay and Brunswick Heads Social Security Offices. In the fortnight ending 28 January 1994, there were 713 JSA and 772 NSA recipients being paid by the Byron Bay Office. These numbers represent a weekly cost in the order of $250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government has in place a rigorous set of compliance measures and a comprehensive program of reviews to ensure only those clients genuinely looking for work, or those with an approved exemption, are paid an allowance.

Property claims by persons of Greek or Greek Cypriot extraction, or with any Greek or Greek Cypriot links (such as Greek financing of the original purchase), have not been accepted by the Turkish Cypriot administration.

For the `impact activation' benefit to work, it is necessary to have the ELT attached securely to a strong point in the aircraft.
