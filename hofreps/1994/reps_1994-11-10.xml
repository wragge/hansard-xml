<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, members, in the first of these bills, we have before us today a very important piece of legislation: the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill. The bill is important because it addresses a key objective of this government's social justice strategy and one of the most challenging issues in Australian social policy today&mdash;homelessness.The bill signals a major step forward in the way we respond to homelessness in Australia and will set a new benchmark in the provision of services to help homeless men, women and young people overcome the cycle of disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the first time a Labor government has acted to revolutionise assistance to homeless people. The bill before us today is very much a legacy of the reforms that were begun by the Labor government in 1974 with the passage of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. This was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation which provided government assistance through community based organisations to homeless people. Homelessness did not suddenly emerge in the 1970s. The first female immigrant's home was established in Sydney by Caroline Chisholm in 1841 and the Sydney City Mission began operating refuges for the homeless in 1861.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was important about the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was that it was the first time that the federal government had recognised that it was the responsibility of national government to provide assistance to homeless people. The other important aspect of the legislation was that it dealt with homelessness as an issue of social policy. In the two decades following that ground breaking piece of legislation, federal Labor governments have shown leadership by playing a central and active role in responding to homelessness in Australia as a key objective of the national social policy agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 the federal Labor government created the first supported accommodation assistance program&mdash;SAAP&mdash;by amalgamating the homeless persons assistance program, the women's emergency services program and the youth services program. SAAP agreements were signed with all states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 a second round of agreements was signed with the states and territories. Under these agreements, supported accommodation programs grew to some 1,600 services, consolidating a network of social infrastructure in regions across Australia which provided accommodation and support for homeless men, women and young people. It is due to the contribution made by these services in this decade that Australian cities and towns do not present the same scenes of street living and begging as New York and London. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994, we have the opportunity to take the reform process in Australia one step further. The legislation before parliament today lays a new foundation for the third round of supported accommodation agreements to be signed between the federal government and state and territory governments by 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill sets a new framework for the provision of SAAP services. The focus is on assisting homeless people to achieve the maximum possible degree of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to move SAAP from a program of last resort&mdash;a `safety net' for people who are homeless&mdash;to one which is active in helping them to change their lives. It seeks to change SAAP from a program which provides care to a program which provides care and opportunities. In the past, we have not been active enough in taking this approach. We have allowed homeless people to remain marginalised. Services have been built in the industrial parts of town&mdash;beside factories rather than in communities. We have paid great attention to providing beds for the night often at the expense of other services, including labour market assistance, health and rehabilitation, child care and long-term housing solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community has often accepted a lower standard of service for homeless people. This has perpetuated the myth that homelessness is threatening to the community&mdash;the images of substandard accommodation, associated violence and crime creating a stigma. The result has been that people who become homeless are vulnerable to entering a cycle of dependence that becomes a lifestyle&mdash;and very difficult to break out of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP clients are among the most marginalised and powerless members of our community. On any given night, up to 11,500 people are assisted by the supported accommodation assistance program&mdash;7,500 of them are adults and 4,000 are accompanying children. Of these 7,500, 56 per cent are male and 44 per cent are female. The majority of women&mdash;52 per cent&mdash;are aged between 20 and 40 years of age. Men tend to be older&mdash;10 per cent of men in SAAP are aged over 60, compared to three per cent of women. Another important statistic is that indigenous Australians account for 15 per cent of supported accommodation assistance program clients. They account for only 1.6 per cent of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The supported accommodation assistance program is generally divided into four sectors. Youth accommodation accounts for 29 per cent of services; services for single men, 26 per cent; services for women escaping domestic violence, 12 per cent; and services for families, 12 per cent. People with children using the supported accommodation assistance program account for 25 per cent of all clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People using SAAP are poor&mdash;87 per cent are reliant on Commonwealth government benefits and a further five per cent have no income at all. As this data illustrates, people who are homeless are extremely disadvantaged in Australian society, and this bill establishes SAAP's place as central to achieving positive outcomes for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is based upon the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic, social or housing status, have basic rights and responsibilities and that people who are homeless have the same entitlement to these rights and responsibilities as any other group in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government is concerned with building an Australia which is fair, which offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities&mdash;in short, to exercise the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have acted to protect the rights of all Australians by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. The government has ratified human rights treaties in relation to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights; in relation to eliminating racial discrimination and discrimination against women; and in relation to the rights of the child. And we have enacted legislation which outlaws discrimination of the basis of gender and disability. All of these initiatives are designed to build social cohesion in Australia and a society which offers equal opportunities to all citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill recognises that we will not make advances in the area of homelessness without a recognition of the rights of homeless people. Access to a home is one of the most fundamental requisites for securing a decent quality of life. The bill seeks to make the rights of people who are homeless to housing and to the other essential elements of a decent quality of life central to the services provided for them and to the opportunities they are offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It outlines the principles that underpin the provision of services to homeless people&mdash;respect for human dignity, respect for cultural background and beliefs and protection of universal human rights. These rights are to be advanced in conjunction with the responsibilities expected of clients while using SAAP services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also recognises the importance of housing to quality of life in the definition of `homeless' which is provided. This is the first time such a comprehensive definition has been included in Commonwealth legislation. Previous definitions have constrained `homeless' to traditional interpretations of total absence of shelter&mdash;literally living on the streets, sleeping in parks, derelict buildings or railway stations for want of anywhere else to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of `homeless' in this bill recognises homelessness as being more complex than the absolute absence of shelter. The definition provides that a person is homeless if he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter.The definition of inadequate access to safe and secure shelter encompasses health and safety issues, the physical environment and the economic and social supports a home would normally offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of a situation which this definition intends to cover is the case of a woman and her children being subjected to continued violence in the family home. Because the woman's health is at risk, the home is rendered unsafe and the woman would be considered to have `inadequate access to safe and secure shelter' and to be at imminent risk of homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill recognises that SAAP does not operate in isolation. It takes account of the factors which lead to crisis, both economic and social, and which influence the outcomes of our attempts to redress crisis and assist people who are homeless to regain independence. These influences are complex and varied and extend beyond access to housing&mdash;that is, to thinking a person's crisis is solved through merely providing a roof over their head. The issues relate to health, to employment, to security of income, to the person's capacity to build and maintain personal relationships, to violence and to the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill sets objectives for the supported accommodation program which link the provision of shelter with all of these other services. It provides for a system in which case managers work with individuals to put together a package of assistance to suit their needs. It may be that an older single man who has been homeless for some time and who is eligible for the job compact is provided with labour market assistance at the same time as SAAP provides his accommodation. A woman escaping domestic violence will be provided with accommodation for herself and for her children and at the same time provided with child care and related support so that she can start to look for employment. A homeless family will be provided with counselling at the same time as the SAAP case manager organises rent assistance and social security to find the family a suitable house for private rental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill asserts the right of homeless people to the full range of government services and community resources and to participate fully in their communities&mdash;the same universal human rights other members of the community take for granted. It provides the framework and impetus for more innovative and integrated responses to the issues which face homeless people.It is about maximising people's chances to participate. The government provided an additional $19 million in the last federal budget to deliver this new approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community will be closely involved with the implementation of this new approach. As part of the reform process, a commonwealth advisory committee on homelessness will be established. It will provide people who are homeless and the wider community with the opportunity to be directly involved in the new SAAP. This committee overcomes the current fragmented approach to community participation in SAAP. It will provide national leadership in both advocacy and policy development for people who are homeless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if people who are homeless are to take their rightful place in the community we must increase understanding in the community of homelessness. The Department of Housing and Regional Development will be undertaking a targeted public awareness campaign during the 1995 United Nations International Year of Tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major messages of this initiative will be that homelessness is not the result of individual failing, but the effect of a complex range of social and economic influences and that homelessness is not a permanent condition. With the right support and assistance, most people who are homeless can regain independence. This campaign will also bring to the public's notice the detrimental effects of attitudes which exclude homeless people from communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP is to continue at least until 30 June 1999, with the Commonwealth, the states and territories maintaining their relative contributions over this time. In 1994-95, we are contributing $104.9 million towards SAAP, while the states combined contribution is $80 million. This government has approved additional funds to foster the reforms to SAAP I have outlined above. In 1994-95, $3.9 million in additional Commonwealth funding is committed for this purpose, rising to $4.5 million in 1995-96 through to 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes provisions to ensure that members of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Homelessness receive adequate remuneration for their expertise and for their time and efforts in participating on such a committee. Remuneration costs for committee members, together with running costs for the operation of the committee, are not anticipated to exceed $60,000 per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill, amends the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1989 to prevent the Commonwealth entering into an agreement, or authorising payments, under that act after the date on which the first state or territory enters into an agreement under the new Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994. The quality of services that the community provides to people who are homeless is a test of our collective commitment to social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Combating homelessness is a national policy goal.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It requires a strong national effort to achieve results, leadership by the federal government and the collective commitment of the states and territories and the community. The federal government will provide the leadership required to make this a truly national step forward, with each state and territory with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill, this government has taken the opportunity to move SAAP forward to become not only a responsive and suitable service to meet the immediate needs of people who are homeless but, for many of them, the point in their lives when they were offered the opportunity to move forward towards greater independence and control over their own lives. I commend these bills to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill simply makes consequential amendments to existing legislation. I do not intend to say any more about it here. The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill, on the other hand, is a substantial and significant piece of legislation which fully deserves the scrutiny of this parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for:</PARA>

<PARA>The supported accommodation assistance program, or SAAP, is a jointly funded Commonwealth-state program, established as the main national response to the needs of homeless Australians. In 1994-95, excluding new funding associated with the measures in this bill, SAAP has been allocated a total of $185 million. It funds the provision of services, mostly through community organisations. Of this, the Commonwealth's direct contribution is $105 million. It is hard, however, to avoid the conclusion that the size of the homelessness problem and the amount put to its alleviation are at least partly due to what we have experienced through economic management in the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As presently constituted, SAAP funds around 1,600 services providing a wide range of support and assistance to homeless people. These services include: safe and secure crisis and transitional accommodation; counselling and crisis resolution; information, referral and advocacy; outreach support to people in the streets, in insecure accommodation or at imminent risk of homelessness; and living skill programs for people affected by homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A SAAP census was conducted in 1992 as part of a statistical evaluation of SAAP by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Allowing for incomplete data in the census, it is estimated that on any given night more than 12,000 people, including children accompanying their parents, were then assisted by SAAP accommodation services. It would be reasonable to assume, on expenditure trends within SAAP, that the 1992 figures would now be exceeded. The census also indicated that, of the clients surveyed, 56 per cent were men and 44 per cent were women; 48 per cent of the men and 59 per cent of the women were under 30 years of age. Most are unemployed; 87 per cent were reliant on social security or other federal allowances or benefits; and a further six per cent had no income whatsoever. Up to 20 per cent came from a non-English speaking background; and eight per cent were Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;or about four times the proportion of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in the general population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These statistics hide groups within these broad demographics, such as women escaping domestic violence, young people who, for whatever reason, have left the family home, people with disabilities and those with a mental illness. The plight of those with mental illness is a particular tragedy, as homeless people with mental illness may wander the streets without effective treatment for their condition and, in many cases, without good understanding of their plight. In his report on mental illness, Brian Burdekin highlighted the fact that good supported accommodation, particularly in hostels, is vital to people with mental illness who need help in stabilising their condition and managing their medication. He noted the role of SAAP in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note, from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare evaluation report, that by far the greater proportion of service provision is concentrated in major centres of population. This seems to imply an underservicing of regional and rural areas, particularly if people from these areas are drifting to the cities to find support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This then is what SAAP is about and this is the client group it is intended to assist. But an informed discussion of the bill before us requires a look at the evolution of the supported accommodation assistance program since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the evolution of SAAP, the main bill here is of relevance to what we are debating today. SAAP mark 1 was announced in 1984 and commenced in 1985. It brought accommodation funding for homeless people in crisis and women suffering domestic violence under the one program for the first time. The first Commonwealth-state SAAP agreement lasted until 1989. The prime focus of SAAP mark 1 was the provision of supported accommodation for people who were permanently or temporarily homeless as a result of crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After an initial program review in 1987, the Commonwealth and states agreed on a new agreement, or SAAP mark 2. This model represented a shift from a focus on crisis support to giving assistance to clients' transition to independence. Where, in 1984-85, 78 per cent of every dollar under SAAP was spent on crisis accommodation, in 1992-93 only 23c in every program dollar was so spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under SAAP mark 2, changes occurred in the type, mix and location of SAAP services including the development of domestic violence outreach services, the introduction of services for the particular needs of youth and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, the redevelopment of large night shelters into more flexible services and the development of a rural service infrastructure. My understanding is that both the Commonwealth and the states have been generally satisfied with the operation of SAAP mark 2. I also understand that major service provider organisations, such as the National Shelter, the National Youth Coalition for Housing and the Salvation Army, have been happy with the working and current mix of accommodation and transitional assistance. But there has been a definite conviction, particularly in government circles, that SAAP could both work better and do more than has the mark 2 model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SAAP: Strategic Directions</EMPHASIS>, prepared for ministers in 1993 by a Commonwealth-state working group, SAAP mark 2 was being hampered by a range of interdependent factors from achieving what the working group and the comprehensive program evaluation report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moving Forward</EMPHASIS>, believed that it could do. Factors identified in the strategic directions document included the shift from crisis to transitional assistance had not been matched by a focus on client outcomes; a perceived need for national outcomes and priorities; service provider staff funded by SAAP were often not trained, or otherwise equipped, to provide the level of skilled transitional assistance expected for clients; and people were not able to a make a successful transition back into everyday living because of their low level of access to employment, work force training programs and income support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government accepted the recommendations of the strategic directions report and acted to put in place an interim SAAP agreement from 1 July 1994 before commencing a new agreement for a heavily revamped program&mdash;SAAP mark 3&mdash;from 1 January 1995. This is to be done under the authority of the main bill we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House is the government's vision&mdash;or, perhaps more correctly, the vision of the Minister for Housing and Regional Development&mdash;of the Commonwealth-state consensus on the shape of SAAP mark 3. I say that it is the minister's vision because, on checking the states of New South Wales and Victoria, I found that their ministers were not consulted on the draft bill after the adoption of the strategic directions report, and I assume this courtesy was not extended to other states or territories either. This is a concern because the coalition believes that, in its present form, the main bill may very well be exceeding the broad direction agreed to and may be over and above what is, in some instances, I think, dubious drafting. I will return to this matter later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main bill before us this morning provides the legislative framework for SAAP mark 3. Amongst other things, it redefines the terms `people who are homeless' and `homeless' for the purposes of the program, restates the purpose and objectives of the supported accommodation assistance program and the services expected of service providers, and specifies the key matters to be included in SAAP agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. These key matters are listed in clause 8 and include implementing case management; developing assessment and referral mechanisms for homeless clients; developing early intervention and outreach for potentially homeless people; enhancing the skills of service provider staff; program management; allowing for the protection of clients' rights; and reporting and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On paper, this looks fine but, in practice, we are concerned that the government is using this bill to subtly assume complete control over the direction of SAAP. Perhaps, more importantly, the government is using this bill to expand the scope of SAAP so widely that it will mean that providers will deliver many services at less than optimum efficiency, rather than deliver more tightly focused assistance with the greatest possible benefit to clients and the taxpayer. It is in this context that I propose to approach the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main bill expands in clause 3 the SAAP definition of people who are homeless to include people in crisis and at risk of being homeless. The explanatory memorandum indicates people likely to become homeless who can be assisted by including the risk of homelessness within the SAAP definition. It identifies such people as women and children experiencing domestic violence, older men and women who are being subjected to abuse by landlords and other tenants, and young people for whom the degree or frequency of physical and emotional abuse experienced in the family home has become intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the coalition has no objection to the idea of early intervention so long as the choice about early intervention remains with the client. Early intervention is particularly welcome where it may relieve pressure on the demand for crisis accommodation by avoiding the need, but we also argue that early intervention without very tight guidelines could give rise to as many problems as it attempts to solve. We do not want to see the situation where people working under the SAAP program decide that an intervention is justified on their own initiative&mdash;for example, youth workers reacting to reported family difficulties in which the young person's perception may be quite out of proportion to the reality of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the way the Austudy homeless scheme has been administered, whereby families have been prevented from resolving their own difficulties by well-meaning but determined staff, and bad legislation, is a good example of the dangers to which I am referring. This legislation encouraged the Austudy workers to protect young people from their families, and they behaved accordingly. Similarly, the definition of homelessness in clause 4 says that a person is homeless if, and only if, he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter. That occurs if the person's current shelter damages, or is likely to damage, health; threaten safety; or if the person does not have access to social and economic supports that a home usually affords. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, this is all very well but such criteria, if uncontrolled, raise a very real risk that the freedom to make judgments on these questions will be assumed by SAAP workers on behalf of clients, rather than it being left with clients to work through these situations with appropriate advice and counselling. From a government which recently piloted a piece of legislation through this House on the premise that it protects the freedom and privacy of individuals, this is a rather contrary direction to be taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the responsibility of service providers, subclause 5(2) of the bill defines SAAP's aims as `to help people who are homeless to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence', and states that one of the goals of this aim is to enable clients to `re-establish a capacity to participate fully in community life'. Subclause 5(3) says that this aim is to be achieved by `providing, or arranging for the provision of, services'. Paragraph 7(a) translates these statements into a new set of responsibilities for service providers, including case management, assessment and referral, and early intervention and the re-establishment of family links with the ominous rider `if appropriate', which goes to the concerns I raised earlier. Paragraph 7(b) specifies the type of assistance to which clients could gain access under SAAP, including employment, education and training, health services&mdash;including mental health services&mdash;disability and rehabilitation services, children's support services, income support and other appropriate opportunities and resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, what we have here is the government's expected framework of case management under SAAP mark 3. The coalition has listened to concerns from service provider organisations about this focus which goes to the very heart of the new direction of SAAP mark 3. Achieving the maximum degree of self-reliance and independence is a departure from the SAAP mark 2 model of providing crisis and transitional accommodation and assistance. What worries the coalition is that this focus on case management, given the demand of SAAP mark 3 on service providers, means that what we see as still being the core objective&mdash;crisis and transitional support&mdash;will be buried. In a letter to my colleague the shadow minister for housing, the chairman of the National Youth Coalition for Housing, John Gregg, says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP has never been about specialist intervention in homeless peoples' lives, and nor should it be. Specialist services . . . will always be required by some homeless people. However this does not mean that SAAP ought to deliver these services. These . . . are largely the responsibility of [other] state government and . . . Commonwealth programme areas, and SAAP should not attempt to provide services in this area, simply because the supply of related services is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>The National Youth Coalition for Housing and other groups such as National Shelter are thus coming to the federal coalition and saying, `Just wait a minute. Before the federal government extends the scope of SAAP, somebody should ask us whether we have the capacity to deliver what is expected of us.' The impression I have, and the one my colleague Senator Tambling certainly has, is that the minister and his advisers have rushed to put a bill together without going back to the states, service providers or clients about the wider implications of what they are proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may say that consultation took place in the context of the comprehensive SAAP evaluation. But I again say that the coalition is certain the government has shaped this bill with little or no consultation and that its interventionist and managerial vision goes beyond what the states or service providers want. The minister should tell this House which state ministers have seen the draft bill and which ministers, if any, have endorsed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will dwell for a little longer on case management in the context of this bill. If Commonwealth-state agreements under SAAP mark 3 are signed along the lines of the model offered by this legislation, service providers will have the responsibility to, as one report put it, help clients get back on their feet. Where does this responsibility stop, and where will the program's exit points be set? Clearly, unless the program guidelines operating under this legislation are clear and unambiguous it could be that clients become trapped in a type of vicious circle with an ongoing dependence on SAAP services that may last well after the immediate crisis or transition period has passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another more obvious concern about this new emphasis on case management is the very high risk of confusion and duplication between service providers who are assisting disadvantaged clients in this and other Commonwealth and state programs. The obvious clash is in relation to services offered under the government's new case management structure for the unemployed. As I indicated at the outset, about 95 per cent of recent SAAP clients were unemployed. Most of them were on income support, particularly the jobsearch and newstart allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CES case management system announced in the government's white paper and being set up under its own legislation, the emphasis is supposed to be on the long-term unemployed and on those unemployed for shorter periods, such as people with disabilities, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, some women and some Aboriginals and Islanders who are deemed to be at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Given that many of the clients of the supported accommodation assistance program are in these target groups, it seems to us that the role of a SAAP service provider should simply be to link clients with the CES for labour market assistance and case management. This is a referral and advisory function which is in the existing scope of SAAP. It does not need SAAP service providers to develop comprehensive case management structures of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also see the potential for overlap with the home and community care program in respect of those clients who particularly have physical or intellectual disabilities or a mental illness. The potential for such a SAAP-home and community care overlap is not a problem at present as each program has its own distinct client groups. But the envisaged early intervention capacity of SAAP mark 3 means that this sharp demarcation line could become blurred in practice, especially if some service providers find themselves involved in both programs. I am certain that honourable members could think of other examples of conflict, such as direct assistance offered to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 10 of the bill specifies that SAAP will not replicate or duplicate a service that is already provided by, or is the responsibility of, any other government program or organisation; that is, other than with the consent of the federal minister and the state minister or ministers concerned. In practice, I suggest that this consent is likely to be given quite often if the case management side of SAAP mark 3 comes into competition with other services and programs directed at the target group. I rather expect that the fears of groups such as the National Youth Coalition for Housing about the future direction of SAAP will come to pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also concerned about the bill's implications for SAAP agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. On scrutinising this bill, we are concerned that, while it is focused on what SAAP does at a provider level, it do not make clear how the responsibility for SAAP mark 3 is to be shared by the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the way this bill is structured and worded, it seems to us that the Commonwealth is reserving the right to have the final say on what services are delivered and which agencies deliver them. For instance, the federal minister has the authority under subclause 6(1) of this bill to `specify a form of agreement dealing with SAAP'. One would hope that this is done in consultation with the states, but it does not have to be as the bill stands. Given the amount of consultation that has gone on with this bill, that does not bode well. This certainly seems to be a hallmark of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get a view of what may happen under this legislation, the minister should take the time, if he has not already done so, to read the report on the home and community care program by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and which included my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). HACC is the epitome of a good program that is losing its way, not the least because of the confusion between the Commonwealth and the states about their respective program responsibilities. The report of the standing committee on community affairs highlights the inevitable consequences of such confusion for the quality, delivery, administration and accountability of HACC services. A clear accountability framework is something that is lacking in this bill. The HACC Act, which included as a schedule the form of the Commonwealth-state HACC agreement, is a model the government could have taken advantage of in preparing this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that this bill involves some dubious drafting practices which the coalition believes are open to potential abuse by a government at some future stage. Let us look at the bizarre one-page preamble to this bill. When I first looked at the bill, it seemed to me that the parliamentary draftsman had inadvertently included the explanatory memorandum. But, on looking closer, I discovered one of the most rambling, incoherent and nonsensical pieces of writing purporting to reflect the will of this parliament that I have seen in a long time. It is full of the warm and fuzzy rhetoric associated with the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, with its talk of empowerment, marginalisation and the like. It cites certain international agreements as mandating the legislation, although, given that these agreements have been an accepted part of Australian law for years, it is hard to see why. It states certain assumptions about the directions of policy for homeless people as a de facto policy statement. This preamble is vague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble of a bill, if it is included at all, is supposed to simply set out the broad intentions of the bill as a guide to subsequent interpretation of the main body of the act. It is not an explanatory memorandum and it should not be an attempt to give a statement of policy the standing of a declaration of law. My understanding is that the preamble's inclusion in this form means that the policy statement it contains will become open to judicial interpretation. We on this side of the House find it difficult to escape the conclusion that this preamble is intended to skew any such interpretation in favour of the Commonwealth while attempting to bind the government's successors in respect of homeless policy. This is a general piece of legislation&mdash;not some bill of rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of de facto Commonwealth domination of SAAP, let me draw the attention of honourable members to subclause 8(g) of the bill. This clause states that SAAP agreements must deal with `establishing the means by which the civil, political, economic and social rights of the people who are homeless may be preserved and protected by service providers'. I find it hard to comprehend what on earth this means. I can only think that it is an attempt at a blank cheque clause by which a socially interventionist federal minister can impose his agenda on the states, particularly those states which may dare to have a different outlook from his. I cannot imagine that any state minister would wear such a broad and impenetrable criterion as this subclause. For me it is proof positive of the lack of consultation in the drafting of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports assistance to the homeless and we also support the continuation of the supported accommodation assistance program. Those Australians without secure homes, or indeed any homes of their own, deserve assistance and compassion, not the least of which should be provided through SAAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that most of the speakers in this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which has a current inquiry into youth homelessness. In my speech, I hope I have outlined the coalition's key concerns about the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill 1994 and the particular provisions which give us a cause for worry. As it stands, I do not believe this bill is tightly enough focused and I believe it is flawed. As I have just shown, its drafting is not good and it gives a free rein to a minister who may choose to have a particular ideological bent. More importantly, it develops a framework for SAAP which may be great in rhetoric but, like many things, may prove to be undeliverable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not oppose the passage of the bill through the House, nor do we intend to consider this bill clause by clause in this place. But when it reaches the Senate, however, we will move that the two SAAP bills be referred to a committee of that place. That committee can then hear the evidence of those who will manage, provide and receive services under the proposed supported accommodation assistance program mark 3. Hopefully, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development will take the opportunity so offered to address the shortcomings of this bill by withdrawing and redrafting it before it comes to the vote in the Senate. In the meantime, I commend my second reading amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite disappointed to hear the closing remarks of the shadow minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). It is depressing to hear, from a person who I thought would have commanded a fair level of respect for those in the community who are most affected by the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill, that the Liberal Party now intends to refer the legislation to a Senate committee, as it does with so much other legislation, and have it sidelined in a political way for who knows how long and for who knows what purpose. This point is reinforced by his comment `de facto domination by the Commonwealth'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that the opposition is not a national party. Basically, it is still worried about trying to get the states more power and more say. But in this particular case that is irrelevant, because the legislation requires that the Commonwealth and states reach agreement. I can assure the shadow minister that the states do not need his help in that negotiation process. They have enough power of their own and their capacity to extract every possible ounce of benefit for themselves must never be underestimated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister is suggesting that the bill should be precise and tight but, at the same time, should empower the states to maximise their negotiating capacity. Which way does he want it? I would have thought that the legislation, in its present form, sets broad parameters for the Commonwealth and states to negotiate and reach agreement. I am bewildered at the idea that, on the one hand, he wants the states to have all this power and, on the other hand, he wants the Commonwealth to have tight, precise and specific legislation. I am quite convinced he does not realise the contradiction and inconsistency in what he is proposing. That occurs over and over again in this chamber with those who want a foot in both camps. I think the ex-premier of Queensland had a point of view about people with a foot in both camps and what happens to them. Whether it was that they could not see the wood for the trees or whatever, my memory fails me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is significant. It changes SAAP in some fundamental ways. One of the most important changes was not even mentioned by the opposition&mdash;the formation of a national coordinating committee, which will incorporate the Commonwealth, the states and many other people involved in the accommodation area. One thing we lack is the public involvement of people other than state and Commonwealth bureaucrats. What we have at the moment are government officials negotiating between themselves with no-one else involved. The absence of any form of national advisory body, national policy making committee or national corporation outside the government sector is of paramount importance. That has come through in recent months particularly in the inquiry I have been chairing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some months now the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has been conducting an inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness. The SAAP issue, as it affects younger Australians, came out in that inquiry. Of the 1,600 services funded by SAAP, about 500 are focused on younger people. The committee released a discussion paper in September, but unfortunately that discussion paper did not have the support of the opposition members of the committee. I say that was unfortunate because it was a genuine attempt to assist the drafting of the legislation but, more importantly, to assist the development of the agreements between the Commonwealth and the states in shaping the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is primarily a framework. The specifics of the actual program will eventually come with the agreements and regulations and all the other parts that follow. In releasing this discussion paper, we had hoped to focus the attention of governments, both state and federal, and interested non-government sectors to areas that needed to be addressed. The response to that discussion paper has been constructive and positive. I will come back to that later. The discussion paper did not have bipartisan support despite the fact that it was in circulation for a week and a half before it was finally adopted by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems the committee found in its hearings and the submissions we received regarding SAAP, or aspects of homelessness, was the lack of data available. We have set up census nights, which have been useful to us. We have looked at figures from all over Australia. Questions were asked about the way that data was collected and the form it took, and clearly it needed to be reshaped. This legislation mandates a national data collection system. I think that will be of enormous benefit to governments, non-government people and all those in the community who are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the national coordination committee, which will be enormously valuable in bringing data together and allowing the non-government sector some input into the issue. We found that there was massive frustration from the providers funded under SAAP. SAAP is funded by the Commonwealth and the states, but those funded under the program talk primarily to the state providers because they primarily manage the program. So there was a gap between the provider and the major funder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is not the de facto dominator, as the previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm, suggested. The Commonwealth in fact funds $10 to the states $8 for this program, but it is not involved directly with the providers. The national coordination committee will allow the two tiers of government as well as providers and others who are interested in this issue to get together and talk about what is happening and how it is happening. Then we will not see a five-year build-up of frustration and difficulty and then new legislation introduced to update it. What I trust we will see will be a continuing process of evolution and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, and I think in the view of anybody looking at it in a sensible way, those clauses will allow for the establishment of national guidelines and national understandings on issues such as case management&mdash;and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Chisholm, mentioned the provider's obligation to protect the civil, economic and human rights of consumers. The three players, including the consumers&mdash;not any one state, nor just the Commonwealth&mdash;will help shape and build that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as the opposition is suggesting, we were to prescribe totally how it should work, firstly, there would be no agreement with the states and, secondly, there would be no point in having an advisory committee, because there would be no scope to vary or to modify, and that is what we badly need. We have talked to a great number of SAAP services and SAAP providers throughout the country, in both metropolitan and regional Australia. What constantly comes through is their incapacity to affect what is happening. The system is cast in concrete; it is fixed and inflexible. The providers are funded under very tight systems. This is the case even though there is wide acceptance that a lot of the parameters are long out of date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look at two areas: firstly, the expansion of the program and, secondly, this so-called interventionist mode, which concerns the opposition so much, and which it sees as a weakening of the program. The whole point of that is: at what point in a family's difficulties is SAAP appropriate? At what point does it become relevant? It is being suggested that we know the answer to that now and that we can legislate for that entry point. That suggestion is obviously fallacious. It is worse than fallacious; it is dangerous. It means that people have to be crisis driven; it means that before we can assist, people have to pass the point where assistance is most worth while. The stage at which it is appropriate to introduce SAAP is a moot point; it needs to be discussed and developed&mdash;not by the government, not by the Commonwealth, not by any one state, but by taking a broader approach which will allow variations state to state and region to region, aided by the national coordination committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of early intervention such an approach cannot be spelt out in precise detail in the legislation, because that would preclude it happening. In relation to young Australians and family breakdowns, the inquiry has found the absolute tragedy of government neglect of families that are in trauma. We only ever buy in when the crisis is so bad and so difficult and therefore, in so many cases, unrepairable&mdash;much beyond the point at which we can assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to talk seriously about supporting people with difficulties in accommodation, and such difficulties partly through family trauma, we have to talk about supporting them at the time which is beneficial to them&mdash;not at the time when they are so obviously broken down that they can be classified and stigmatised as a totally dysfunctional family. How do we phrase that? If `early interventionism' is the wrong phraseology, what is the right phraseology?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not hear the shadow minister tell us when and how this should be done. He is saying, `This is an open door approach; this is social engineering; this is allowing intrusion.' What poppycock! That is absolutely outrageous when it comes from a man who is well respected in the caring community for his compassion. Obviously, he will not be respected for his depth and profundity, because he clearly does not understand the question that this legislation attempts to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By incorporating in the legislation a capacity for early intervention, and by establishing a national coordinating committee, we will start to allow the development of appropriate systems. The shadow minister used the word `appropriate'. I do not know. Perhaps it is the American election. Perhaps it is this idea of swinging back to the Right. Perhaps those who are moderate on the other side are suddenly terrified of losing their seats or their endorsements. The shadow minister said that the words `if appropriate' in paragraph 7(a)(iii) were ominous. What are we talking about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, all that is suggesting is that, in a number of families, the sexual violence, the physical assault, risk and danger that is involved in forcing those families back together is so great that it is not appropriate to seek a family reunion. And that is happening throughout Australia now. We have seen example after example. We have talked to young Australians who have been traumatised and victimised. The suggestion that somehow we should force them back to their families because it is in their best interests is absolutely outrageous. For the shadow minister to suggest that the use of the words `if appropriate' is ominous indicates that he does not understand the issue at all. The suggestion, therefore, for early intervention is to allow the development of a more appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, two aspects have arisen during the hearings into the current inquiry&mdash;and I have said this publicly on a number of occasions. These were the two key issues that virtually everybody we spoke to agrees with, and that includes parents, providers and young Australians who have suffered homelessness. The first aspect is early intervention, addressing the problem earlier. A lot of young people have said to us, `Look, if we could have had some help sooner, we may not have become homeless.' Parents have said the same thing. `If we had got some help sooner, we may not have broken down.' So early intervention is recognised as one of the things we are all agreed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we are agreed on is better training of the people involved in the youth industry. Training is part of this new legislation&mdash;the move towards having the SAAP community better trained. It is a tragic reflection on our society, our standards and values, and on our opposition and the kind of bagging we have just been getting from the previous speaker and which I have no doubt we will get from other speakers, that we value so lowly those in whom we put so much trust. The people to whom our children and families turn for support and help when they are in trauma are so lowly valued, so lowly paid and so lowly esteemed that there is a tragic message therein. We are saying to those families, `We think so poorly and so little of your problem that the people we will be asking to help you with it do not really need much training nor very high pay and, in the social order of things, are really pretty lowly ranked.' That is a tragic message, but it is a message that the previous speaker put forward when putting forward his argument about case management and early intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management, as we raised in our discussion paper, is a complex issue. The legislation does not prescribe how it will function with SAAP. All it does is lay out that there will be some form of support. We have talked to a range of organisations, and each has its own definition of case management. How the case management in the legislation evolves and develops will not be dictated by the Commonwealth as far as I can see, certainly from feedback I have received from both state governments and organisations we have dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the idea of there being more than just support for housing, of actually helping people link back to other services, of understanding the broader picture and having people better trained and qualified who can recognise when best to intervene and where best service and other special services may reside and who may best help is all about skilling and better esteeming the people our families can turn to when they are in trauma. Yet these are the things being rubbished by those opposite. As I have said, I am disappointed because I think the previous speaker has been held in extremely high regard by those in the community who work in the caring community sector. But his ignorance on this topic is bewildering. It is worse than that; it is disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We produced a discussion paper on this topic to raise government, non-government and community concerns about areas that we needed to look at. I am quite satisfied from a personal point of view that the legislation allows our concerns to be addressed. Our function, during both the rest of our inquiry and the report, I trust, will be to ensure that those concerns are addressed. But to suggest somehow that we should be opposing early intervention, as the amendment proposes, to suggest somehow that we should be opposing as parliamentarians the idea of case management, is not borne out by all of the 16 days of hearings we have had or what is, I suppose by now, thousands of pages of transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have heard from the community and the SAAP community is the need to become more professional and to be more clear in what their roles are. We also raised some concerns in the discussion paper, which the legislation still allows, and I trust what will evolve is a better networking between governments. The great tragedy of what we have been covering in these months is that state and federal governments and state and federal departments collectively and individually do not present in a unified way. That is tragic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation, with the support of the national coordination committee, will enable SAAP to be seen as being a single program across Australia. Certainly, it can have variations, and that can be accommodated, but the idea of a national advisory committee and the perspective and feedback that it can give both ways&mdash;to providers and to the national and state policy makers&mdash;can give us a single perspective. In my view, in some ways that is the most important ingredient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that, in the next five years that this agreement runs, we will see changes as they are needed, not a building up of problems and stagnation until suddenly we have a big change every five years. What I want to see is incremental change as changes are needed. I trust this legislation will allow that. The coordinating committee can be the focus of such change. I trust that, when honourable senators see the aspects of this legislation, they will reject the idea that it should be sent to a committee and shelved for months and months, which is what the opposition clearly intends. This legislation needs to be supported. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

If honourable members read the speech of the honourable member for Chisholm, they will see one of the most constructive, well-reasoned, sensible contributions that I have seen developed in relation to a bill presented by the government in a long time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The early intervention model, which is generally recognised as being most appropriate for assisting those people who will require the sort of support that is given in this legislation, is not something that is going to be developed in this area, which is very often at the end of the road for those people who might be helped through early intervention. That is one of the reasons that we on this side of the House raised the concern that we have about case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Newcastle mentioned in his comments the fact that a number of the speakers in this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs and that a discussion paper was released recently by the committee. He referred to the fact that members of the opposition distanced themselves from some of the conclusions that were reached in that paper. We did so because we were of the view that it was very early days. There was a lot of evidence to be taken, and we were not prepared in advance of that evidence to put ourselves on the record as agreeing to conclusions dictated by the honourable member for Newcastle. The honourable member for Newcastle believed a discussion paper ought to be available in a timely fashion for the government to be able to consider some of the issues raised in the context of legislation that was going to be introduced into the parliament. That is the reason he brought it forward at the time that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand that the discussion paper, which we distanced ourselves from for the reasons I have outlined, did come to some views and presumably expresses the views of somebody.

One of those organisations is the National Youth Coalition for Housing. I do not think it would be seen as some conservative, reactionary body looking for right wing policies because of some results in elections in the United States of America. Its critique was extraordinarily well developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what the committee had to say. The committee had some observations to make about case management. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper also expresses concern that the move into casework could be seen to institute "a quasi wardship" style approach to dealing with service users in an attempt to inexpensively replicate services once provided by now defunded or non-existent State government services for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee reiterates the comment it has made throughout this discussion paper, that is, that there is insufficient co-ordination between the Commonwealth departments in the area of youth services. The case management strategy being incorporated into a number of programs in various departments clearly illustrates this. There is a danger of creating duplication and overlap which will have a detrimental effect on many of the young people who are to be "managed" and who require a well integrated and easily understood approach from support services.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, there appears to be a tendency for some government departments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>here we are talking about SAAP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to be moving beyond their portfolio . . . responsibilities for young homeless people. This could have the effect of not only duplication but also of blurring responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the views that the member for Newcastle adopted and I suspect wrote. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP services, for example, cannot be expected to provide a high degree of intensive personal assistance to its clients. These services should be provided by trained staff with specialised skills and it may be unrealistic to expect SAAP workers to undertake this.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to deal with the training of SAAP workers in particular and their skills and qualifications to be able to offer these services. It is instructive to look at what some other people are saying&mdash;particularly about this government&mdash;about youth homelessness and at the way in which other organisations that take an interest in this legislation, dealing with these questions, are commenting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Welfare Rights Centre, not a right wing reactionary body, wrote on 3 November to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) about the government's new Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill, which replicated provisions in the social security legislation to establish a separate system of income support for unemployed people between the ages of 16 and 17 years living away from home. It was in that context that the Welfare Rights Centre wrote about a legislative framework generally to achieve objectives for young unemployed people and homelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote from the centre's letter because its comments are particularly instructive in relation to other legislation and this legislation because the same conclusions can be drawn:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation framework to achieve this is already in the Social Security Act (where it rightly belongs). The fact that 97% of the legislation you propose is a direct lift from the Social Security Act proves this. The Bill achieves nothing new&mdash;other than a name change and a tightening of the definition of "homeless/independent". It goes overboard on the symbolism but achieves little of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This symbolism is not without considerable cost however. Aside from the enormous waste of proposing and dealing with lengthy legislation (some 271 pages and a further 110 pages of consequential amendments) when a handful of simple amendments to the Social Security Act would achieve the same outcome, the Bill takes unemployed 16 and 17 year olds outside the income security system, which for 15 year olds and all other ages is regulated by the Social Security Act. Other people with say, disabilities, special family needs or who are aged not (hopefully) to be hived off into their own Acts for any substantial or cosmetic reason.</PARA>
<PARA>These are serious criticisms which are being developed about the nature and the style of the legislation that we are being asked to deal with. The criticism that the honourable member for Chisholm has developed about this legislation had its genesis in the comments that were made by umbrella organisations interested in these very matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter, addressed to me personally, from the National Youth Coalition for Housing. It asks for this legislation to be the subject of further review. It asks specifically that the legislation be developed in consultation with the community centre. It takes the view that the matters dealt with in this legislation relate directly to a bureaucratic plan for SAAP 3, which was developed without consultation with the community sector. The youth coalition asks us to support the amendments when the bill is debated in the House of Representatives or the Senate and to have those matters considered. It was a very developed critique, some of which appeared in the speech of the shadow minister, in relation to the aim of the SAAP legislation set out in this bill and how it is to be achieved in clauses 5(2) and (3). It also developed a particular critique in relation to the responsibility of service providers and to clause 8, the key matters to be dealt with in the form of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that this is in some way a right wing ideological approach is a very poor defence of the legislation the government has brought forward. The criticism that has been mounted is that, rather than symbolism which is involved in this legislation, we should really understand the nature of the problem and deal with the adequacy of resources. The following point was made in the discussion that was submitted by the national youth coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new SAAP aim . . . broadens the scope of SAAP's support role well beyond what could conceivably be achieved by a program of this nature, without any commitment to increased resources.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the nature of its argument. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NYCH fears that the important accommodation focus of the program will be lost due to this new expansion into support.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there are other organisations out there that do carry responsibilities and might be able to intervene at an earlier point. This legislation is duplicating the sorts of activities in which they are going to be involved in and it will, without providing additional resources, essentially use funds that would otherwise be available for providing housing for those who are in need. That is the substance of the youth coalition's criticism. It is saying, `You have lost your focus.' This minister wants to get involved in this legislation because he has an expressed and focused interest in these matters, so he has to have it highlighted in this legislation for which he is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This critique&mdash;I could go on at length outlining it because I think these are some of the most cogent criticisms I have seen mounted on a matter of this sort&mdash;is before us. If there were a situation where I could incorporate the totality of the comments I would do so but, unfortunately, the standing orders of this House no longer permit it. My colleague also quoted from the letter, particularly from the paragraph that stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP has never been about specialist intervention in homeless people's lives, and nor should it be. Specialist services (eg. drug and alcohol services, psychiatric and generalist health services, counselling services etc.) will always be required by some homeless people. However, this does not mean that SAAP ought to deliver these services. These services are largely the responsibility of State Governments and other Commonwealth Program areas, and SAAP should not attempt to provide services in this area, simply because the supply of related services is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, do not seek to replicate what others are trying to do, do not create problems of consultation or duplication and use the funds that would otherwise be available for housing where there is a demonstrable need to do so. I do not see that as an ideological criticism. It goes on to make comments on clause 7(b), responsibilities of service providers. The letter I have received has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7(b) suggests that the onus is on SAAP service providers (ie. workers at youth shelters and the like) to increase homeless people's access to the following: employment, education and training, health services, disability and rehabilitation services, children's support services and income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP services have always attempted to refer SAAP clients to these services, as part of an overall strategy of moving clients towards independent living. The major frustration in achieving this aim has been the sheer lack of employment and education opportunities and support services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears ludicrous that SAAP services are expected to take responsibility for increasing homeless people's access to employment, health services and the like, when the broader community are already having difficulty in accessing the same. SAAP cannot and should not be expected to increase homeless people's access to these things. Future evaluations of the program will surely render SAAP a failure in this area, due to structural issues beyond the control of the program that dictate access to employment etc. NYCH questions why legislators would deliberately want to set SAAP up to fail in this area?</PARA>
<PARA>They are very serious comments from people who have some knowledge and expertise. These people make the points very strongly about the matters that ought to be dealt with in relation to an agreement with the states, particularly under clause 8, which refers to implementing case management. They raise some questions about the interpretation of that&mdash;that one might be expecting agreements to deal with implementation and, hopefully, the next round of agreements ought to deal with the continued management of case management if it has been put in place. These people have raised serious issues about drafting which ought to be the subject of examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the speed with which the government wants to move in this area, and in which legislation is being proceeded, is well beyond that which ought to be available for consultation and discussion with those who are interested. The exclusion of these people from that process has been one about which both they and we are concerned, and an opportunity will be provided by the Senate if the government is not prepared to postpone this matter and ensure that a proper examination takes place. </PARA>

In my speech I will deal with a number of the issues that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has raised, but I would first like to say a few words about homelessness. I think it is something that has been recognised by the community in this country only over the last 20 or so years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We celebrated not long ago the anniversary of the opening of the first women's refuge in Sydney. We heard from the women who set that up about the great difficulties they had in convincing governments at all levels&mdash;including the federal government&mdash;that there ought to be assistance for people in that situation of distress. It is to the credit of the government of the day, including the now Governor-General, that it was instrumental in identifying the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one of the problems is that most of us in this parliament, and in every other parliament, come from fairly secure backgrounds and perhaps have not had a lot of experience&mdash;certainly very little first-hand experience&mdash;in this area. I remember that, when issues about adoption were being discussed in the upper house in New South Wales, one member came out and told the parliament about her experiences of having to crawl out the back window of her home, with the aid of a friend, to get her children and herself away from a violent and disastrous marriage. Now we do have places to which women in distress and young people who are subject to violence and intimidation at home can go. I include in that psychological abuse, which we sometimes overlook. We think that if people are being bashed or sexually abused they have a good case, but there are other kinds of abuse which are just as severe and from which people&mdash;whether they are women in a marriage or young people in a family&mdash;need to get away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A few years ago I had the privilege, and the great frustration, of working in a program for homeless youth in Sydney as a volunteer. These were not kids who had just left home and could be picked up by some of these facilities; these were young people who had been living on the streets in Kings Cross in Sydney. Those of you who know the area will know how tough it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was given the care of a young man who was then 18. He was born a drug addict; his mother was an addict. He was adopted by well-meaning parents who did their best for him but who, like most people in those days, did not know what to do with addictive babies. It is only really in the last few years that we have begun to know how to handle that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So he grew up being a very frustrated and hyperactive young man. He was given various medicinal drugs to change his situation which, in the long term, only exacerbated his addiction. He was on fairly hard drugs by the time he was about 11 or 12. He was in and out of youth detention centres and had a very bad time of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is such a great shame is that this young man, like so many of the people who I came across in that program, was exceedingly bright. This boy dropped out of school at 14, but he had been part of the school debating team. He could pick up a two-inch thick paperback at Central Station in Sydney, arrive at my place two hours later and have read most of it. He could tell you all the characters in Tolkien's novels. He had a brilliant mind. It is to me a great shame and a personal distress&mdash;I came to love that young man&mdash;to see a life being messed up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trigger in his situation was drugs. His homelessness was caused by that and a lack of understanding in his, as I have said, well-meaning family. Homelessness is caused by a number of things. In that case, they were the triggers. I might add that it has been several years since I have heard from this young man. At that stage, he had just come out of gaol. He was doing a TAFE course and doing extremely well at it. But I know that his phone has been cut off and that he is not at the same address. I suspect that he is probably lying in a street doorway somewhere, if he is still alive. I am just saying these things to set the scene and to show honourable members how the whole situation of homelessness is important to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must do all that we can for people who find themselves homeless, be they in a situation similar to that of this young man, they are young people who have been abused in some way or they are wives and mothers who want to get away from a violent marriage. We need to do all that we can for them. Therefore, the SAAP program and the SAAP agreements between the state and federal governments are extremely important in providing those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote what the bill sets out to do:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliament recognises the need to redress social inequalities and to achieve a reduction in poverty and the amelioration of the consequences of poverty for individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Homeless people form one of the most powerless and marginalised groups in society. Responses to their needs should aim to empower them and to maximise their independence. These responses should be provided in a way that respects their dignity as individuals, enhances their self-esteem, is sensitive to their social and economic circumstances, and respects their cultural backgrounds and their beliefs.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely important aim for the government. In dealing with some of the issues that the honourable member for Berowra has raised, and if we are going to do those things, we need to do more than just open the door of a refuge, give them a key to a room and say, `That's it. You've got a roof over your head.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to talk about the definition of homelessness. It does not just mean that somebody does not have a roof over his or her head. For the purpose of this act, a person is homeless if, and only if, he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter. So people in a refuge are still, for that definition, homeless. It also includes people who are in crisis and at imminent risk of becoming homeless and people who are experiencing domestic violence and who are at imminent risk of becoming homeless. So those people under this act are eligible for SAAP services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One new factor which has been brought up that is coming into this agreement but which has not been in the previous ones is SAAP operatives being responsible for case management. I share the concerns of some of the previous speakers&mdash;I have to say that I did not hear them all&mdash;about the possibility of the case management offered at this level overlapping with case management which is already carried out to some extent by Social Security and, under the white paper provisions, by DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were several reasons that the standing committee on community affairs put out the discussion paper which the member for Berowra referred to. The government had entered into protocols with the state governments&mdash;this is to do with the homeless youth inquiry&mdash;as to who should look after young people of certain ages. There were also concerns that white paper provisions for the youth training allowance and the SAAP agreement were going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite astonishing that the member for Berowra condemns that discussion paper. He got all his fellow opposition members on that committee to sign a paper and put out a press release condemning the discussion paper. Yet he just read from the discussion paper precisely the things that we are all concerned about. We are all concerned about the possibility of people being case managed five times. That is precisely what the discussion paper said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of honourable members, I will outline the reason why the opposition members of the committee did not go along with that discussion paper. We had limited time in which to consider the draft. We were all busy. We all had problems getting time to read it. When we came to the meeting to discuss it, the member for Berowra had not read it. When we started to go through it, he asked for more time. We agreed on a meeting later that day, which was the deadline. We had to get it out in order to get it to all the people who had contributed to that inquiry. When we got to that meeting, he still had not read the discussion paper and wanted to spend the next three hours or so going through it. As we all had other meetings to go to, it was passed as it stood. For the member for Berowra to say that there are conclusions in this discussion paper which should be part of the final report is incorrect. He keeps saying that, but he has not read any of the conclusions. He has read only the bit that he agrees with. To that extent, the member for Berowra stands condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of case management, yes, I have concerns too. As I have said, we all have concerns. My local refuge has concerns. I have taken those concerns to the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), who has assured me that there will be provision for training and additional staff which will be necessary to carry out this procedure. Many of the refuges that we have talked to during the standing committee inquiry have said, `We're already doing this.' It is a logical place for case management to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take the example of a young person who comes into a youth refuge. He is in distress and is feeling vulnerable. He finds somebody at that refuge who is willing to look after him&mdash;to give him accommodation and to sit down and talk to him. What better person to case manage that young person? It is much better than sending him off to an impersonal bureaucracy somewhere, such as DSS or DEET. I am not condemning those authorities; they do very good work. But a young person in this vulnerable situation will relate to the person who has put out his hand to help him. That is a very good reason why those SAAP facilities should be doing case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticisms levelled at this bill are due to a lack of understanding. The member for Berowra says that there was no consultation. Incidentally, he says that he had a personally addressed letter from the National Youth Coalition for Housing. So have I; so has every member of the standing committee. Every member of the House may have one&mdash;I do not know. I have read that letter and I do not think it is quite as dramatic as the member for Berowra has said. I am advised that that group and all the other groups involved with SAAP were fully consulted before the drafting of this bill. It has not been rushed through as the member for Berowra says. Those people have been involved in the drafting process and none of what is in the bill is of any great surprise to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read that letter, I immediately related its contents to my own refuge and its instant fears, `Oh, my God, we've got to take on another responsibility.' All they need is some reassurance that they will not be dropped in at the deep end and that training and assistance will be provided. As the National Youth Coalition for Housing said in its letter, they already do a lot of that. I guess that comes down to what the definition of case management is. Does it mean that the case manager at the youth refuge physically has to go out and find a job for the young person or does it mean that the case manager has to put the young person in touch with different bodies, employment agencies and so on? I see that as being part of case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is just a little panic reaction from some of these people. They feel that they have to take on this huge burden when really they are just being the carers for these young people for the duration of the time that they are there. They should make sure the young people have income support and that their health is okay. They should take them to a doctor if they need a check-up and give them some advice on basic primary health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My local youth refuge is, at the moment, conducting a federally funded education program for young men on basic health. It provides sex education, basic hygiene advice, dietary advice and so on. I think we will find that most youth refuges do those things already. We are just giving it another name and making sure that those things happen. I do not think there should be a big drama about case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put out the discussion paper to get some feedback from people working in the area on how we can case manage young people who are coming in under the youth training initiative, Austudy or whatever. It may be the case that DSS or DEET will say, `This person is being case managed by the youth refuge; it does not need to be duplicated by one of us.' That may or may not be the way it will happen. That is why we needed the discussion paper that is condemned by the member for Berowra. I hate to say it, but a lot of the problems result from personal animosity between the member for Berowra and the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris). I am heartily fed up with sitting through many standing committee meetings and putting up with this conflict. That is my problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member is not on the committee. I have a few concerns about the way this bill will operate, principally because, like so many pieces of legislation that come before this House, it involves a state-federal agreement. Any state-federal agreement has to work smoothly at both ends. Very often they do not. I heard this morning from a minister about federally funded projects which are channelled through state offices and which are then claimed to be state programs. We have all had experience with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking the experience of my own local youth refuge, I have found that the state people have said to them that, under the new agreement, they will have not a local management committee but a state bureaucrat running the show. I am opposed to that. In my experience, and no doubt from the experience of many people in this place, community organisations which are run by local management groups have the commitment of the local community because the management committee is drawn from the local community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think of a couple of people on the management committee of that youth refuge who are very committed. There is an elderly gentleman on that committee who is also on the committee of the local youth centre. We would call him a pillar of the community, the salt of the earth. He gives so willingly to those organisations through fundraising, making sure the staff are happy and so on. I believe they will run much better if they are managed by community management groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I realise that, because those people are volunteers and amateurs, they sometimes do not have the expertise in financial management, personnel management and whatever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be a great shame if this bill were amended, watered down, and the provisions relating to case management taken out. If those umbrella groups which have expressed concern and been consulted&mdash;it is erroneous to say they have not been consulted&mdash;sit down and work through the legislation with the federal bureaucrats who are there to see that it works properly and the states cooperate, then we will find that this is a good piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned by several members that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is conducting an inquiry at the moment into certain aspects of youth homelessness. We have almost finished our proceedings. We have been to every state in Australia and we have talked to government departments. It is timely that we are conducting the inquiry now, considering the changes in the white paper and the current legislation. I think our input will be valuable. The information in the white paper will be valuable to our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen young people and we have seen the people who work with them. Hearing from those people first-hand about the problems they have had with various agencies and various set-ups gives us an advantage when reporting to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin). I hope other ministers will be involved and read our report and see that we want to make sure that those young people do not slip through the net, are properly looked after and get what is due to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the situation people are in when they become homeless. Lack of self-confidence and self-esteem was one of the things we talked about. What we learnt through the inquiry, and what I have learnt certainly from my own experience, is that young people particularly lack self-esteem, as do the women who leave disastrous marriages that I have mentioned and sometimes also adult men who find themselves in difficult situations. You only have to go to the Matthew Talbot Hostel in Sydney to see some of the problems there. They do lack self-esteem and that is one of the things I think the SAAP worker can help with a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the social workers at Social Security are doing their best as well, but their brief in lots of ways is a little different. The youth worker in a youth hostel is better able to get to know the young person who is sitting there with them. They may be on night duty and seeing them at night&mdash;seeing their night fears, attending to their nightmares and so on. I think developing that self-esteem is one of the most important things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Providing shelter is one thing, and providing training, employment and maybe a reconnection with the family are another, but without self-esteem all of those things are going to go down the tube. I think rebuilding self-esteem is one of the most important things we can do for young people and that, to me, is a fundamental part of case management, which is a fundamental part of this bill. It is my sincere hope that this bill will go through both houses unamended&mdash;unless there is any way we can improve it for the lot of the people who are homeless and who will benefit from this bill&mdash;and be adopted across the board. </PARA>

Labor in government over the last decade has recognised the pivotal role that the public housing sector plays in broadening the opportunity of all Australians to decent quality and affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 10 years and successive budgets, Labor in government has thoroughly demonstrated that strong commitment to the public housing sector and to the delivery of housing programs such as SAAP. I hope that in the 1995 budget the government maintains its very strong commitment. I can assure the minister that he will have the support of the caucus committee in the discussions that he has with colleagues and with Treasury and Finance in defending the amounts of money that the federal government allocates to public housing and to programs such as the one which is before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has a long held commitment to the sorts of social policies that support those most in need in our community. The supported accommodation assistance program is an important plank in this commitment to social justice, as it secures Labor's commitment to helping homeless men, women and children through to 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program was established in 1984 and came into operation on 1 January 1985. It was initially a safety net program but has subsequently been moving towards taking a more active role in the reintegration of people into society and the resolution of crises and conflicts. The many programs that SAAP now funds and supports include night shelters, soup kitchens, hostels, social work agencies, women's refuges and day centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The published reports and the anecdotal evidence would suggest that SAAP has very effectively and satisfactorily fulfilled its important role. For example, the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moving forward</EMPHASIS> report, which was a national evaluation of the SAAP program, found that this program had been largely successful in achieving its aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated aim of the 1994 SAAP bill is to help people who are homeless achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. To achieve the aim of the 1994 SAAP legislation, the government, in cooperation with the states and territories, will be continuing the SAAP program with funding for this financial year of $105 million, with funding of some $74 million for the states and territories. This funding will be indexed annually to 30 June 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, the SAAP program has proven itself to be an important vehicle for combating homelessness in this community. The various reports that have been mentioned in the debate thus far have endorsed the success of the program. I guess we can ask ourselves why a program of this type has been so successful. One of the features of this program has been the way that it has brought various levels of government together to address a very urgent need in the Australian community. We have seen cooperation with local and state governments in the delivery of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, the program focuses very much on the empowerment of individuals who at a point in their lives are significantly disempowered. At its core, it has a preventative philosophy&mdash;the early identification of people's problems and the provision of assistance to them. I think we can constructively look on the SAAP program as an investment&mdash;not as a cost to budget or a cost to the community&mdash;in a very important area of housing and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read through the briefing papers on this piece of legislation, I must say that a fairly warm feeling came into the heart. Enshrined in the preamble to the bill are some very important statements that really do reflect the underlying philosophy of the Labor Party in government when it drafts this sort of legislation. I would like to share with the House four of the aims which are outlined in the preamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first aim is to take into consideration the social position of the homeless and their lack of power. It is very important that the government, in the programs that it delivers, recognises the social condition of those who are receiving assistance&mdash;not to have a handout mentality when it comes to these particular programs, but to have as their core philosophy the empowerment of the individual clients over time through the assistance they receive. I think that is a very admirable objective and one which has been effectively achieved thus far in the SAAP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the preamble there is a very important acknowledgment of the second aim: the role for government and the need for government to respond to the needs of the homeless. Yes, the community does have an awareness of the problem of homelessness existing in our society. But at least in this legislation we see a very discrete and public acknowledgment, on the part of the Labor government, of the needs of the homeless. The needs of the homeless are acknowledged and the desire to empower them, through legislation and government support, is enshrined in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aim is the adoption of international treaties regarding the protection of personal rights. We have had much discussion in the community, and indeed on the floor of this House, on this very important point. But Labor in government does not go around simply endorsing and adopting the principles of international treaties for the sake of it. Some of these treaties enshrine some very important principles which ought to be acknowledged by an Australian government and by the Australian community. So I am very pleased to see that, in the preamble, this particular principle has been enshrined as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the fourth aim is the most important and really says something very good about the SAAP legislation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the need for involvement of community . . . in providing assistance to the homeless.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important point because the total community must accept responsibility for providing all of its citizens with the wherewithal to meet people's basic primary needs of food and shelter. The SAAP program is evidence of the government's desire to involve the total community in meeting this very important problem of homelessness in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Reid, you would be aware that my particular electorate, like yours, covers one of the most important provincial cities in Victoria, and indeed in Australia. It is very important for the regions to involve themselves in processes which identify the housing needs in their area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the situation in my own electorate is concerned, we have been very fortunate in the Geelong region to have an agency which has undertaken the fairly monumental task of identifying the needs of the region&mdash;and I refer to the Barwon Region Housing Council. The council went through a process, in 1993 and throughout 1994, of developing a housing policy strategy paper. I would particularly commend the work of one of the operatives in that organisation, Mr Chris Couzens, and the staff of the Barwon Region Housing Council for their great work in drawing elements of the Geelong community together to confront the real housing needs of the people of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process of wide consultation, as I have said, has produced a strategy paper, and that strategy paper provides a very firm base for the community of Geelong to develop a coordinated response to housing needs in the Geelong community. I am pleased to say that the recently formed city of greater Geelong has finally involved itself in the process of evaluating this particular strategy paper and bringing the key players in the region together to devise a coordinated and action response to the problems that our community faces in confronting homelessness and meeting the housing needs of people in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been fortunate enough to hold meetings with commissioners and officers of the City of Greater Geelong to discuss local government involvement in meeting the housing needs of the region. I have also held extensive discussions with representatives from the community sector. I note with some joy the employment of an officer within the community services sector of the City of Greater Geelong who has extensive expertise in the housing area. I am looking forward to local government involving itself much more in this particular process and providing the catalyst for the rather disparate interests in the region to get together and move forward in meeting the housing needs of people in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention some of the findings of that strategy paper because they relate very much to the sorts of issues that we are discussing here today. The strategy paper found that there was a need for further crisis accommodation in the Geelong region. There was a problem of affordability in the private rental market for low income individuals and families. I made the point the other day in a debate in this House that around 30 per cent of families in my electorate earn incomes of less than $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy paper made some comment about the quality of affordable housing, and the discrimination against particular subgroups and the lack of affordable and flexible housing for those particular groups. More importantly, the report identified and emphasised the relationship between the housing sector and other service areas such as health, transport, and employment. It also stressed the important role of federal,  state and local governments in delivering services to this community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP in Geelong has been very successful, and around Australia the SAAP program funds up to 1,600 different services. One of the particular services that I would like to mention is a dental scheme for homeless young people which services the Geelong suburb of Corio and is run out of the Corio community health centre. That particular program has a twofold aim. Its obvious and primary role is to provide dental care to homeless youth in the area who would otherwise not have access to what can often be expensive dental work. The second and perhaps more important role is that it puts the centre in touch with homeless youth and gives them the opportunity to alert these young people to other forms of assistance that they might need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to the contribution by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) who, in one of his usual eloquent displays on the floor of the House, was very critical of this particular program and the government that sponsored it. I guess that is his role. At this point, I want to contrast the position of the opposition and that of the government on these sorts of issues. In a recent speech I made reference to the manner in which this government has addressed not only the economic wage issues for low and middle income earners but the social wage issues as well, and of course our expenditure on housing is a very important part of the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When The Things That Matter&mdash;or `the things that batter'&mdash;was launched, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) uttered some great platitudes about the concern of the opposition for the underprivileged in this country. But in the document the sparse budgetary details that members on the other side of the House have given mask their underlying commitment to rip the guts out of the social expenditures undertaken by the federal government at the national level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you were to win government, you would intend to proceed with the removal of tax on savings. That would suck some $3 billion out of the revenue base. If we add the costs of a new family department, infrastructure spending that you have said you will undertake, reductions in taxes, and private health insurance incentives, that means simply one thing&mdash;massive increases of expenditure on the outlay side. When we put all these sorts of factors together we find that the opposition is hell-bent on cutting expenditure not only in the housing area but also in the education and health area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to let the honourable member for Berowra get away in this House with blithe statements about the opposition's position on these matters. I would like to give the House an example of Liberal governments in action when they deal with these sorts of issues. In Geelong, St Augustine's receives substantial funding from state government to provide medium to long-term accommodation for adolescent boys. That expenditure was slashed by some $300,000, or 40 per cent, by a Liberal state government. The Director of St Augustine's, Brother Trevor Parton, said that the involvement of two Liberal members, Mrs Ann Henderson and the MLC for Geelong Province, Bill Hartigan, was `scandalous'. Liberals in action on the ground are engaged in fairly scandalous behaviour. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without any reservation I commend the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill and the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill to the House as I commend the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), whose work over a period of time has enlarged the original concept of a Labor government in 1974 which indicated a national responsibility to deal with the plight of homeless persons. It was in 1989 that that initial approach by the Commonwealth was consolidated further so that services provided to the homeless sector of Australian society extended to some 1,600 organisations around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with considerable interest to the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) and the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). I wonder whether they realise that this legislation carries the support of the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, the Council for Homeless Persons and Hanover Welfare Services. That is the reality. The minister and his department and officers have consulted at great length with all those major organisations, and this bill carries their support. So we may well ask: has the coalition thought its way through this legislation? Indeed, has it thought its way through these concepts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chisholm criticised the aim of SAAP. In fact, this aim, as represented in the bill, is substantially the aim for SAAP, endorsed by all community services and ministers, represented in strategic directions and further endorsed in negotiation phases before the drafting stages of this bill by all state and territory officials. I do not know whether the coalition is preoccupied with some internal problems which we read about in the newspapers. But, clearly, those opposite have not focused their attention on what this bill sets out to achieve. The amendments that have been moved indicate that they have not seriously applied their minds to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a test for that. It is useful, on the basis of preceding legislation and preceding involvement of the national government on this issue of homelessness, to look at just how well the coalition thought through these concepts of need and Commonwealth involvement in the run-up to the last election. With some interest I went through that historic document Fightback, which was endorsed by both the speakers who, presumably, had thought about the role of the national government in dealing with the problem of homelessness and its effect upon the nature of our society. All one could find were two general statements: the coalition will look after the needy and give more help to families. In a very detailed document, there was no mention of specific funding and no mention of the role of the Commonwealth in looking after the homeless. There was only one minor reference under the heading `The Family'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attacking the problem of crime also involves attacking youth homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA>Great! It has actually got round to considering the proposition. The document goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our homeless young people are vulnerable to crime. They are particularly vulnerable as victims of crime.</PARA>
<PARA>No-one could disagree with that. It goes on further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family breakdown is the major contributing factor to youth homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA>It is certainly an important factor. Then it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition puts great emphasis on the role and importance of the family.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention of the role the Commonwealth has to play and no mention of the funding that is needed. It then goes on to say that they will provide lots of premarriage counselling. That was the level of thought and consideration given by two prominent members of the coalition who had a position in drafting the coalition's policy in the run-up to the last election. Just as it is clear from the coalition's policy documents that the detail of the concepts involved in this legislation were not even considered then, it is perfectly clear that they are not even understood now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chisholm, who hails from my own state, emphasises the need for consultation. But the consultation he is talking about represents the continual policy problem that confronts the coalition. At the end of the day, it does not know whether it is a national party or a confederation of state groups. Clearly, what has evolved in this parliament is a view that there is an important role for the Commonwealth to play in dealing with the problems associated with homelessness. What we have here is a concern&mdash;I have no doubt it is a legitimate concern of the member for Chisholm&mdash;about the principle of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of our legislation, I believe all governments, state and federal, have to continually consult with those expert groups and community organisations involved in particular problems. We have to get the wisdom and counsel of people who are working in the field. That has occurred here; it has occurred with all the major organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consultation, as a principle, does not stop there. I believe in this principle. So too does the government, and the coalition seems to&mdash;but it stops short. The honourable member for Chisholm gave a lengthy speech about consultation with the states. What he means is that what is important is the consultation that goes on between federal bureaucrats and state bureaucrats. The minister, as I have already pointed out, has consulted with all the major community groups. At the draft stage, there were also discussions with representatives of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Chisholm believes the issue of consultation is so important, why is it important to the opposition to bring amendments into this parliament? He is a member of a national party in a state where the principle of consultation does not exist. Only this week the government of Victoria abolished funding for the Youth Accommodation Coalition. Was there any consultation with that organisation? Was there any consultation with the community groups that support that coalition? Was any consideration given to the impact this would have on the work this organisation does? There was not one bit of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a dichotomy in the attitude of the honourable member for Chisholm, who has carried this argument on behalf of the coalition. He has produced a confected set of amendments which will simply delay the application of this legislation if it is carried. He is committed to the principle of consultation between bureaucrats&mdash;and some of that has already taken place, as I have pointed out&mdash;but he has not stood up as a significant member not of this parliament but of the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party to say it is time for what has been the most dictatorial government in the history of Victoria also to consult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was there any consultation with the expert bodies and those responsible for mental health services before the government of Victoria virtually put people with mental illness out onto the street, in situations where in many cases were a threat to themselves and to other citizens? Was there any consultation before important public services in health and education were diminished? In my own electorate, decent and highly respectable citizens are being arrested because they are defending a park against a decision of the Victorian government. The Victorian government is using the powers of the police force to arrest those citizens carrying out a protest designed to protect a facility which a previous Liberal government some years ago decided was absolutely not necessary or desirable to be used for a car race. Was there any consultation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on an important piece of legislation, we are getting an attitude from the opposition which again indicates that it cannot make up its mind where its national responsibility lies, whether it is a states party or a national party&mdash;that is, a party that is concerned to think its way through the obligations that rest upon an opposition in this parliament to seriously consider how to deal with legislation as important as this in terms of national responsibility. I have no doubt that the House will reject this confected and artificial set of amendments, because the only effect of referring this legislation to a committee would be to threaten the continued smooth operation of SAAP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP is already operating under an extension of the old agreements and the old act. It is important in this area&mdash;more so than in many other areas&mdash;that the people who run those services and their clients know quickly where they stand so they can proceed with all the new planning that has to take place. There will then be effective accountability established so that we can get an effective administrative regime for an invigorating and refocused SAAP. That is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have got what we have from this thoughtless coalition because it has a letter from one group. Prior to the last election, coalition members had no policy in place for their own election commitments. They had not thought their way through the implications of this legislation. They totally ignored those very important community organisations that are dealing every day at a face-to-face level with this problem&mdash;and I have enumerated them&mdash;and their support for this legislation. What is important to the honourable member for Chisholm, a fellow Victorian, is that he establishes the principles of negotiation and discussion with a state government that discusses no aspect of its policy&mdash;at any level&mdash;with community organisations and democratically elected representatives of community organisations. There is not a municipality or a region of Victoria which at the moment is not in revolt about the way in which the Victorian government has gone about restructuring local government. It has hired political appointees to replace democratically elected councillors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has there been a word of protest from the people who stand here and say how important it is to negotiate? Those protests are coming not just from independent councillors or people who are councillors and might be members of no political party, but also from members of the Liberal Party. This is important legislation, and it is important that it be put into place quickly and effectively. That the coalition has not sorted out its national responsibilities in this matter is no reason why it should confect a reference to some group of people in the Senate. The only effect of that exercise is to delay the implementation of a much needed service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to solve all the problems of homelessness but&mdash;because of this policy, the national involvement and the attitude of this minister&mdash;despite the immensity of the problem, you do not walk about Melbourne and Sydney and see the desperate plights that you see in London or other parts of Europe. The results of a longstanding conservative government are that you cannot walk in places like Hyde Park or the major streets of London without seeing people huddled under any form of shelter they can obtain. We still have great challenges in this area&mdash;one must not minimise that&mdash;but, because of the attitude of this government and its philosophies, we do not face poverty everywhere we move and we do not find people living in the appalling conditions in which people in other parts of the world are living in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the legislation to the House and I hope that by the time it gets to the Senate the coalition will have rethought its responsibilities to this legislation but, more importantly, to those organisations which need to be able to implement the policy considerations and the funding that comes with this legislation so they can get on with the job. This is far too important for the kind of confected nonsense which has been brought into this House as an ill thought through a set of amendments. I believe that these amendments ought to be withdrawn so coalition members can walk away and think again about their national responsibilities in this very important area. </PARA>

There is no question that homeless people are extremely disadvantaged. This bill establishes the SAAP's place as being central to helping persons in those circumstances achieve positive outcomes.

<PARA>The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains three sets of amendments to legislation in the industrial relations portfolio. First, the bill alters the arrangements for industrial relations in the coal industry. Secondly, it gives effect to a recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal that the parliamentary allowance be incorporated into the base salaries of members of parliament.  Thirdly, the bill improves the quorum and voting requirements for the national Occupational Health and Safety Commission. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Coal Industry</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>This bill represents a landmark step in the rationalisation of industrial relations arrangements in the Australian coalmining industry. The bill provides for amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It will bring industrial relations arrangements in the coal industry into the industrial relations mainstream. From the day it comes into effect, industrial relations in that industry will be regulated by the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal's powers and functions are presently established by complementary Commonwealth and New South Wales legislation, which commenced in 1946. That makes the Coal Industry Tribunal about the same age as the Liberal Party. Some might say that they are equally anachronistic in the 1990s. Fortunately, coal industry unions and employers have proven themselves willing to embrace reform. This was despite the efforts of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the political equivalent of a steam engine, to huff and puff about an alleged government cave-in on the reform bill. Having just performed a breathtaking backdown on Jobsback himself, it was an astonishing performance from the member for Bennelong. No sooner had he put his tired old press release out than the employers were out there welcoming this reform package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the member for Bennelong could not believe was that the government had cooperatively delivered yet another reform which the conservatives had avoided&mdash;and avoided shamelessly&mdash;during the Fraser government when Ian Macphee had to back off for Doug Anthony. Yet we have been able to implement the reform in a manner acceptable to both unions and employers, to whom I want to pay tribute. Without them this historic change could not have been undertaken in an industrially peaceful manner. Only through detailed negotiations have we been able to reach agreement with the United Mineworkers on most aspects of the legislation. Where we have been unable to agree, such as on the issue of access to enterprise flexibility agreements, we have agreed to disagree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice, the government would not expect this to become a major issue in the industry, given the high level of unionism and the strong leadership of the UMW. Either way, the experience of this legislation gives us cause for optimism that future issues can be addressed in a similarly cooperative, tripartite fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the way so many of the government's reforms have been achieved in the last decade. In the coal industry, like so many others, the conservatives left it to Labor to reform the special industrial arrangements that applied, arrangements introduced in 1946 to meet the specific circumstances then applying in New South Wales, and arrangements that are no longer appropriate to a modern and export focused industry, particularly when that industry is now as significant in Queensland as it is in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current complementary legislation reflects an agreement between the two governments&mdash;Commonwealth and New South Wales&mdash;for the regulation of the coal industry in New South Wales. Each of the two governments has undertaken not to take any action, without the prior concurrence of the other, to repeal or amend any of the legislation covered by the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of New South Wales has indicated to the Commonwealth that it is also its view that industrial regulation of the coal mining industry should be mainstreamed through the transferring of the powers of the Coal Industry Tribunal to the existing Commonwealth and state industrial tribunals. I wish to emphasise that, in view of the existing agreement over changes to the current complementary legislation, the measures proposed in this bill will only commence when the Governor of New South Wales agrees in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is introduced at a time when the coal industry has been going through a period of significant reform to its administrative and industrial relations arrangements. In 1992 this parliament, acting with the benefit of complementary legislation passed by the New South Wales parliament, made changes to the functions of the Joint Coal Board. This included making the Australian Industrial Registry responsible for administrative support to the Coal Industry Tribunal, in addition to performing that role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Also, during 1992, legislation was passed to establish a new Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave Funding) Corporation to reform the way long service leave was funded and administered in the industry. These reforms are all designed to improve the efficiency of the coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role and functions of the Coal Industry Tribunal have of course been the subject of public discussion for many years. A number of previous inquiries have recommended its abolition. However, it is only this government, through today's historic legislation, that has bitten the bullet on a necessary reform. It has done so after full consultation and discussion with the relevant industry parties, all of whose views have been taken into account in drafting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You hate this one! The process of mainstreaming began in August 1993 when the government wrote to a wide range of industry parties, including the relevant state ministers, seeking their views on the industrial relations arrangements which should apply to the coal industry in the future. We received a range of responses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We continued the consultation process by releasing, in July 1994, a copy of a draft exposure bill and explanatory material outlining a preferred approach to reform. Again, a range of views were received in response. The government has considered all of those views in developing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We consider that the coal industry should be subject to the same industrial relations institutional arrangements as other industries. The coal industry no longer needs a separate, specialised and insular industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fundamental change in a key export industry. We do not deny it will be challenging for the parties to adapt to the mainstream system after such a long period under specialised arrangements. However, we are confident they will do so smoothly and effectively. As originally introduced, the bill would have provided a two-stage process for change. Under the first stage, the Coal Industry Tribunal would have continued to exercise its current jurisdiction, but subject to a number of provisions for partial integration into the mainstream of the federal industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After further discussions with the industry parties and with New South Wales and Queensland, the government has now decided that a two-stage process is unnecessary. I foreshadow that the government will be moving amendments to this bill to omit the initial transitional stage. The amended provisions of the bill, when proclaimed, will mean the abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal and full integration of coal industry industrial relations arrangements with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Awards made by the Coal Industry Tribunal will continue in force as if they were awards of the commission, and matters which had commenced in the tribunal will be heard by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments which the government will move in the consideration in detail stage also expressly provide for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to any decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal that are relevant to the matters before the commission. Furthermore, we expect that, in accordance with its usual practice when assuming a new jurisdiction, the commission will give due weight to relevant decisions of the local coal authorities and boards of reference established under the Coal Industry Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate for the legislation to expressly recognise what would be the practice ordinarily adopted by the commission. The considered views of the previous specialised tribunal ought not be ignored when they are relevant to the decisions of the commission. The requirement will be for the commission to have regard for relevant decisions, not to be bound by them. As time passes, earlier decisions of the tribunal will cease to be relevant as they are overtaken by changes in circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following very constructive discussions which I had with my ministerial counterparts in both New South Wales and Queensland, the amendments will also establish a basis on which New South Wales and Queensland will be able to legislate to overcome jurisdictional restrictions, which would otherwise confront the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in dealing with local disputes in the coal mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will provide that if New South Wales or Queensland adopt the federal act with appropriate modifications, to apply as a law of the state concerned, the commission will be able to exercise the powers and perform the functions available to it under state law. Reflecting the complementary nature of this scheme, any full bench of the commission which is exercising such jurisdiction is, as far as is practicable, to include a cross-appointed member of the state tribunal. There will be further discussions with those states and the industry parties about the best way to implement these aspects of the legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a question of whether New South Wales will be able to change its side of the existing complementary legislation within the same time frame as the Commonwealth. Understandably New South Wales wishes to be certain of the final form of the bill, after it has been considered by the Australian Parliament, before proceeding with its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid delays, the amended bill will rely on the corporations power for certain transitional purposes. In particular, this relates to the conversion of tribunal awards to commission awards; however, reliance on that constitutional power will cease when complementary New South Wales legislation is in force. The bill's reliance on the trade and commerce powers to supplement the commission's jurisdiction will not be necessary since the Commonwealth and state governments are developing a complementary scheme for this industry. In those circumstances it will be unnecessary to proclaim that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that the legislation will have effect from a date to be fixed by proclamation. We intend for the bill to come into force on 1 July 1995, subject to the agreement of the Governor of New South Wales as required by the bill. This will allow the commission and the parties enough time to make all the appropriate arrangements before the legislation commences. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments to the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 will implement a recommendation by the Remuneration Tribunal that the parliamentary allowance of $4,767 per annum, introduced from 1 July 1994, be incorporated into the base salary of senators and members of the House of Representatives. The tribunal said that an amendment to the legislation would serve to improve the transparency of parliamentarians' remuneration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background to the proposed amendments, the annual base salary of members of parliament is currently specified in the legislation and is payable at the maximum salary rate applicable to a Senior Executive Service band 1 officer in the Australian Public Service. This pay linkage provides a practical and sustainable approach to determining salaries of members of parliament and senators and ensures that they will not be treated in isolation. However, with the introduction of performance based pay in the SES, the link originally intended has not been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary allowance re-established the pay linkage between parliamentarians and the SES at the base of SES band 2. The tribunal, when determining this allowance, had regard to the wage fixing principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, to the spread of enterprise bargaining agreements in the public sector and in the general work force, as well as to the developments in parliamentary practice and the conditions under which parliamentary service is performed. It should be noted that this measure does not affect the net remuneration of members of parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will involve a very minor increase in Commonwealth expenditure. As a result of the integration of the jurisdiction of the Coal Industry Tribunal into that of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, it is necessary to review the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales governments under which the cost of administration of the Coal Industry Tribunal is shared.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday the minister really excelled himself. He put out a press statement in which he said that the federal opposition had finally admitted defeat on industrial relations. He said that we had utterly changed our policy.

If one can mix one's metaphors, which I guess one is inclined to do on these sorts of issues, this bill is a high-water mark in the monkey organ-grinder relationship between this minister and the trade union movement of Australia. For a long time it has been commonsense industrial relations to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. That has been the view of many commentators on industrial relations; it has been the policy of the coalition; it has been the policy of the industry; and, in April of this year, it was the announced policy of the government. I want to dwell on that for a moment. We are now in November, and we have the final version of the government's legislation. It has taken the government three attempts and six months to get this legislation right. </PARA>

I would agree with the member for Throsby that, if at the end of the day you have the right result, it would have been a justifiable exercise. But, at the end of the day, you have not got the right result. At the end of the day, you have been seen to have engaged once again in an act of surrender to the trade union movement of Australia. Having paid back the political support that unions gave it in the 1993 election campaign, having paid its political dues in full plus compound interest through the Industrial Relations Amendment Act 1993, the government has again genuflected before the barons of the trade union movement on the issue of the Coal Industry Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister went on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program in April and said that it was good industrial relations to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal, was he serious or was he just playing politics? He was not. In fact, I immediately offered him the support of the coalition because it was consistent with coalition policy. But, of course, I had not bargained for&mdash;perhaps I should have&mdash;the reaction of the unions. Since that announcement in April, we have had three different legislative offerings from the minister. Finally, we are left with a bill. Undoubtedly, the bill improves the current situation, but it falls a long way short of what has been desirable for a long time. It falls a long way short of even the Hancock recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be the last bloke in this parliament to hold up the Hancock committee as an epitome of what ought to be done to industrial relations in Australia. But, on this occasion, we had the Hancock inquiry, which was composed of Professor Keith Hancock, Charlie Fitzgibbon, the former federal secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, and George Polites&mdash;very experienced people in industrial relations. They certainly had a different view of industrial relations from mine, but I respected the experience they brought to their work. Most of the recommendations they made in their inquiry in 1985 were to reinforce the present system. Indeed, the 1993 bill had its genesis in the Hancock recommendations&mdash;in particular, the destruction of the secondary boycott protections, which were a monument to a level playing field so far as small business and the trade union movement is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the things this government has done, the most shameful of all in industrial relations is to, once again, put trade unions above the law. The government introduces bill after bill allegedly to reinforce the notion of equality before the law. We are lectured from day to day about the need to eliminate discrimination from our society. We are told that any form of discrimination based on gender, race or religion properly is abhorrent to what Australians stand for. But, when it comes to discrimination by reason of membership or non-membership of a trade union, the government develops a great amnesia&mdash;that does not matter; that is an acceptable form of discrimination. Just as there is no form of murder or crime which is acceptable, there ought also to be no form of discrimination which is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the difference in principle between saying to a person, `You may not have a job because you are a Catholic or a Jew' or `You may not have a job because you don't belong to the union'? I have never heard a satisfactory answer from anybody sitting opposite. They have never been able to explain that moral double standard. They have never been able to justify discriminating against people by reason of their conscientious and genuine objection to belonging to industrial organisations. They smugly go about maintaining this double standard. Until the Australian Labor Party comes to terms with its moral duplicity on that issue, it will never be convincing advocates of a discrimination-free Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 industrial relations bill and this little tawdry, inadequate exercise before us today is in a sense a child of that larger exercise. The 1993 industrial relations bill did a number of shameful things, the most shameful of which was the destruction of the secondary boycott law. By changing that law, the government did a very simple thing. If a corporation called John Howard Pty Ltd imposes a secondary boycott on a corporation called Eric Fitzgibbon Pty Ltd and causes that company damages, the managing director of that company can go to the Federal Court of Australia and get an injunction immediately telling John Howard Pty Ltd to back off. If that company does not back off, it can be up for contempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet if I sool a union onto Eric Fitzgibbon Pty Ltd and cause the company the same damage, he does not have the same remedy. He can bleed to death for a minimum of three or four days without any effective legal remedy at all, and then, only by leave and permission of the Industrial Relations Commission, he can go to court. The grim reality, as anybody who has an atom of understanding of small business will know, is that if we deny essential supplies to a small business for three or four days it can go broke. That does not apply to a big company or a big union, but it applies to all the hundreds of thousands of battling small businesses which are the economic life and soul of this company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By destroying the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act, you have created yet another new class in Australia; that is, rogue unions which can thumb their nose at normally civilised conduct. You are proud of that. You have been trying for 17 years to destroy those provisions, and you finally got the numbers in the Senate to do it. I think that was the most shameful element. When the coalition wins the next election, the first thing that will be put in our industrial relations reform act is a restoration of the secondary boycott provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those provisions enshrine is a very simple principle; that is, that we all should be equal before the law. Until you embrace that principle, you cannot claim to be convincing advocates of non-discrimination in Australian society. You are humbugs when it comes to discrimination.

The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) said it was a landmark step, and indeed it is. It is a pleasure to follow the wide ranging speech of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few weeks, aspects of this bill have given some government members some cause for concern.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that the controversial nature of the legislation has been resolved. It has been resolved through consultation and discussion between the major players. It has been resolved with some skill and sensitivity, which is what really rankles those sitting opposite.

But it has been resolved without that and all the wonderfully profound speeches of those opposite have to go back into the bottom drawers of their desks, where they will remain. This has been solved with skill and sensitivity&mdash;and that is what rankles the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piffling amendment that the honourable member for Bennelong has moved, and which was seconded by the honourable member for Gippsland, is a piece of time-consuming nonsense.

The coalminers of Australia are special to me and will always be so. I make no apology for saying that.

He talked about everything but the bill because he could not find too much in it to object to. But they are his own views. He has the support of no-one in the opposition for this legislation. Who does he represent in this matter? That is the question we now have to ask. He does not represent the views of the coal employers, who are reported in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as welcoming the outcome of the government-union talks on industrial relations reform in the coal industry. </PARA>

The only people not welcoming it were the honourable member for Bennelong and the seconder of his motion, the honourable member for Gippsland.

The facts are that the consultation and discussion which have taken place between the government and the mining unions have resulted in very productive outcomes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is of vital importance to Australia. It is a major export earner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what if it has taken six months. The honourable member for Bennelong made much of the fact that it has taken six months to get it right.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal was established by the Commonwealth and New South Wales coal industry acts of 1946.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, the need for a separate tribunal dealing specifically with the coal industry has been questioned. In fact&mdash;the honourable member for Bennelong referred to this&mdash;page 437 of the Hancock report called for discussions to take place between the Commonwealth and New South Wales with a view to abolishing the CIT. One argument suggests that the reason for the current bill is that the CIT could not resolve quickly enough the dispute over coal prices in April this year. The argument goes that this indicated that the miners had contempt for the decisions of the CIT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As one of those who supported the April strike over coal prices, I supported the right of the miners of Australia to protest against the stupid practices of Australian negotiators who sell our coal on an ad hoc basis to the Japanese. I have told the story many times in this chamber about all the Australian coal producers being held up in a hotel&mdash;usually a luxury one&mdash;in the centre of Tokyo and then being called in one by one to negotiate with the centralised negotiating body of the Japanese, which always is probing to find the weakest point. Inevitably, it does find it. When it finds it and the first of the coal producers caves in, there is a mad scramble to get volume. It usually means a cut in the price of coal. In order to keep the price up, they want to get volume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the arguments about the CIT hold any water. Anyone who cares about the price we gain for our exports, especially with such an important natural resource as our coal, would have supported that dispute in April. It highlighted the commercial corruption being engaged in which is costing us dearly and which urgently needs to be addressed  for the sake of this important industry and our nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been reported in the media and other places that the CFMEU was opposed to the abolition of the CIT. I have already paid tribute to the CFMEU for the role it has played. It is certainly true that the union and a number of my colleagues, myself included, were against the wholesale abolition of the CIT. However, the union and my other colleagues&mdash;unlike the coal employers, who simply wished the CIT away, or the opposition who would abolish it with no questions asked&mdash;decided to mount a very strong case for retaining and transferring to the AIRC the most positive and effective features of the CIT. This has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CIT has served Australia very well since it was established. It has been argued that, by placing the coalmining industry into the mainstream of industrial relations, perhaps now the coal industry can experience the same flexibility, productivity and general efficiencies experienced by other industries. The Australian Coal Association, in a media release yesterday welcoming this legislation, has made the point that `it will benefit both employees and employers by providing opportunities and competitiveness'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These views, however, seem to ignore the fact that the CIT has been exemplary in implementing the government's award restructuring policy objectives. In fact, every available industrial relations indicator suggests that the coal industry is ahead of any other Australian industry in development of the Industrial Relations Commission's 1988 structural efficiency principle and the 1991 enterprise bargaining package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one can deny that the coal industry has been exceptional in the pace and degree of workplace reform, productivity growth and enterprise bargaining. This has been facilitated by the CIT through its low-key, non-technical approach which has allowed the employers and the unions to sort out their problems directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the legislative package that is now before the House will allow this industry focused, non-legalistic approach to continue. The main problem in my mind at the moment is the employer fixation on throwing all industrial relations issues to the enterprise level. This ignores the benefits to be gained from an industry level approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with the union's dedication to the coal industry, it has made the valid proposition that a vision statement should be adopted for the industry which will commit both industry parties to work together at peak levels. I understand that the employers are still dragging their feet on this particular issue. However, I would commend it as something to discuss. I have no doubt that the CFMEU will continue to push it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry has always had a high level of enterprise bargaining. An average of 25 per cent of weekly earnings is negotiated on a site by site basis, and has been for decades. In fact, it can be said that the CIT pre-empted the current enterprise focus by more than 40 years. This bargaining preceded formal enterprise bargaining in the AIRC. Bargaining in the coal industry takes place at at least two and sometimes three levels&mdash;the industry, company and site levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with the anti-union focus of some employers, like CRA, many want all wages and conditions to be negotiated at the enterprise level. This idea is about giving greater power to the employer in dealing with these issues. It seeks to reduce and eliminate the award safety net and is at odds with achieving Australia's economic national objectives. Enterprise agreements now cover over 60 per cent of all blue-collar workers in the coal industry and over 50 per cent of production. This figure is much higher than all other industries, except metals, the federal public sector and some parts of the construction industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity growth has been over five per cent since 1980. It has been over seven per cent in the last two years. Productivity growth has outstripped wages growth, which has led to falls in real unit labour costs. This productivity growth of seven per cent is double and triple that of most other Australian industries. This growth has occurred despite falls in investment. It is the result of working harder and smarter rather than having new capital equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this bill, the current industrial relations framework of the industry is not the source of its problem. The press statement of the Australian Coal Association, which I have already referred to in this debate, makes light of this. The problems stem from companies which are unprofitable, not because they cannot achieve high productivity growth but because they cannot get decent prices for their coal. For instance, the price cuts which were negotiated earlier this year&mdash;up to $US3.85 per tonne&mdash;had the same effect on coal industry revenue as the wage increase per employee of $500 per week. No amount of workplace reform is going to solve this problem. As usual, the unions&mdash;in this case the CFMEU&mdash;and the government provide a convenient scapegoat for employers and the opposition who are unwilling to reform or take responsibility for reforming unfair market arrangements in countries like Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is an unwillingness to do this&mdash;and that is the position of the local coal employees and the opposition, which supports and claims to represent them, although there will be a few questions on that now&mdash;the response must be to pass on the cost of those mistakes to the work force. So if an employee, a hardworking coalminer, is told to work harder for less, as members of the government we lose taxation revenue, with a consequent flow-on effect throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Integrating the CIT into the AIRC solves an administrative problem. However, the problem which besets the industry is based on the price gain for Australian coal exports. The coal industry has already achieved significant or&mdash;if one wants to be extravagant&mdash;phenomenal workplace reform and productivity growth, which is yet to be matched in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred earlier to the proposal by the CFMEU contained in the union's submission to the Taylor inquiry, which recommends the adoption of an agreed vision statement between the unions and the peak employee groups. This would, I understand, involve the development of an explicit partnership between employees and the unions to achieve industry reform and set goals for the industry. But, as I also said earlier, the coal employees are dragging their feet on this matter. They have yet to agree to the proposal in principle, let alone in any other way. I commend this legislation to the House and sympathise with the opposition. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Time expired</EMPHASIS>)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another classic case was where a company decided to retrench 140 employees from a mine which had suffered prolonged losses.

The industrial relations record of the coal industry is shocking. It is appalling. It is a matter of national shame. While the coal industry has only 0.3 per cent of the nation's labour force, it accounts for 12 per cent of working days lost through industrial disputes. The coal industry lost 3,288 days per 1,000 employees through industrial disruption in 1993. The all-industry average was 108 days.</PARA></TALK.START>

The industrial dispute statistics of the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that there was an increase of 146 per cent in the number of working days lost in the coalmining industry between the 1993 and 1994 financial years. That massive increase can be largely explained by the ineffectiveness of specialist industry arrangements. </PARA>

One cannot help but have some personal respect for John Maitland because of his varied skills and personality, but one must condemn him for propagating this separation between employees and employers which is all so unnecessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the outset I indicate my personal support for this legislation. I indicate that support within the context of some reservations that I have about some aspects of the agreement that has been reached and about some details that I would have preferred to see included in the legislation. I want to indicate my general support for the legislation because I think it represents a really remarkable outcome on the part of a government which is prepared to negotiate, to consult and to compromise as is necessary and to come to mature, sensible and constructive arrangements with the trade union movement. In particular, in this case, it is an arrangement with the United Mineworkers Federation, a trade union which has shown itself on many occasions to be better informed about the circumstances of the coal industry and the importance of the coal industry to Australia, and about the future possible direction of the coal industry in Australia, than many of those people who purport to be the experts. The miners federation has traditionally been right when it has adopted a position, when it has interpreted a set of circumstances and when it has offered solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it really reflects unfavourably on the opposition that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the shadow minister for industrial relations, indicates in his amendment that all words after `That' should be omitted with a view to substituting words indicating that, while not opposing the passage of this bill, the House does three things. I am not going to read those three things. They have already been read out, and they are on the public record. But I will say this: those three actions suggested by the member for Bennelong&mdash;presumably with the support of the opposition&mdash;are petty, they are nasty, and they are vindictive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition is attempting to prove with that amendment I simply do not know. What the suggested actions do prove, probably without the opposition's intention, is a complete lack of understanding of the realities of industrial relations in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence is in all of the actions that they take and all of the things that they say, showing&mdash;as the honourable member for Throsby indicates&mdash;a certain lack of feeling for, affection for, or understanding of, the Australian trade union movement. The outcome of those negotiations has been nothing short of successful, in anyone's estimation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I have some reservations. Anyone concerned about the operation of the coalmining industry and the effectiveness, the coordination and the consistency of government policy would be concerned about any particular outcome which is not thrust down people's necks&mdash;which is not arrived at as a result of donning the jackboots and going in in a confrontationist way, which is quite clearly the approach that would have been preferred by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to emphasise to the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) that, although he comes from a rural constituency and a rural background, he now has a responsibility on behalf of the opposition to become better informed about the industries for which he is responsible and also to develop a little bit of understanding about the nature of coalmining and its importance, and the sorts of ways that we need to address the problems that exist there. He has to understand that there were extensive negotiations, as there should have been. I hope that, if ever at any time in the future&mdash;God forbid&mdash;the opposition becomes the government, it will show an equally responsible approach to the need to negotiate with interest groups in the community. That includes, absolutely, the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a confrontationist approach. It was an exercise in open door negotiations and open door politics. It was an exercise in access, both by the union and by the government&mdash;both by John Maitland and by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). It was an exercise in contact. It was an exercise in consultation, in negotiation and in agreement. Where agreement could not be reached, there was an understanding between them that they would disagree on those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were at the end of that negotiation process some outstanding issues, which are still unresolved. One is in connection with the intrusion of legalism into the whole area of industrial relations in Australia. Let me say&mdash;absolutely, forcefully and emphatically&mdash;that I support any proposition to seek to reduce the area of legalism in industrial relations. I would prefer to see a reduction in legalism in all areas of human relationships. What is needed in industrial relations, as in other forms of human relationships, is an understanding, a maturity, an ability, a willingness to consult and to negotiate. We do not need silk in that process, nor do we need to indulge ourselves in the luxury of the costs of employing the silk so that men and women cannot sit around a table and discuss things without looking to the person on their right or their left and saying, `Mr or Mrs QC, how do we respond to that?' That is not mature, it is not sensible and it is not conducive to sensible results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area in which I share a lot of the union concern relates to the whole application of what we refer to as the EFAs, the enterprise flexibility agreements, in relation to the coalmining industry. In terms of unionism, the coalmining industry has traditionally been a closed shop. I endorse that. I was born into a coalmining community of about 600 or 800 people and my family were coalminers. My father carted timber to the pits in order to hold up the roof under which my uncles, my grandfathers and my cousins hewed coal. I know the way in which they depended upon one another, not only for their security in the mine but also for their security within their communities and for their security, one to the other, in the conditions which they fought bloody hard to get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I strongly support unionism, and I say emphatically that within the coalmining industry I support compulsory unionism. Without those unions a lot of those people, families and communities that have survived through and within that industry would not have survived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is in fact the most highly unionised industry in Australia, almost 100 per cent, including the administrative and the clerical workers. That makes a total of about 30,000 people, all of them committed to the principle of unionism and to the protection of the values of unionism. The industry has a long and a proud history of effective industrial representation by trade unions, the United Mineworkers Federation, included now in a larger national union structure, and before it the Miners Federation, as we always referred to it. It is one of the most advanced sectors with respect to enterprise bargaining, which has already been undertaken in the coal industry. Let me emphasise that the cooperation of the coalmining unions and coalminers and the leaders of the coal unions has resulted in a level of enterprise agreements which is at least as high as the best results in Australia and higher than most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These enterprise flexibility agreements were specifically designed to cover lowly unionised industries. My colleague the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) indicated that in his second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide access to the non-union sector, enterprise flexibility agreements will operate for employers and employees at an enterprise who are subject to federal award coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>So, on the basis of that sort of qualification, it is not necessarily something which is appropriate for coalmining, which is already highly unionised. I believe that unions have a role and must have a role in the development of enterprise agreements. Never let us move away from that, whether we are social democrats or democratic socialists on this side of the chamber or whether we are more conservative members of the coalition. If we have any understanding of the history of industrial relations and the history of unionism in Australia and the achievements of unionism in Australia, if we have any understanding of those things at all, we will recognise the important role which trade unions have traditionally played in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that EFAs are needed in the coal industry, nor do I believe they are appropriate. I believe that their use in the coal industry could be as a deunionising strategy such as has occurred in other sectors. It has been suggested to me, `Look, Bob, you do not have to worry about that because the coalmining industry is already highly unionised, so it is obvious that unions will have to be involved in the development of those enterprise agreements.' But, Mr Deputy Speaker, I put this proposition to you: at some time in the future, with the application of this type of enterprise bargaining, there will be a new coalmine opened and employees will be employed in that mine on the basis of their not being a member of the union and on the basis of their entering into individual contracts with the employer. We have already seen evidence of that happening, and that is a matter which will be resolved in due course in the normal course of industrial relations and, I would hope, with a minimum of industrial conflict. But I would not hold my breath until there was any form of guarantee that that is going to be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the whole question of the legal profession accessing industrial tribunals. I emphasise again that it is not appropriate in any type of mature, adult negotiating arrangement. I think it is very unfortunate that when the more recent period of more intense negotiations and consultation started between the minister and the national President of the United Mineworkers Federation, John Maitland, and their advisers and their colleagues, but particularly those two fellows, it started in an unfavourable way, in an undesirable way. You will recall that earlier in this year we had 20,000 coalminers taking industrial action. They were not taking action over wages or over conditions; they were not taking action over safety factors; they were not taking action over accumulated disputes with coal owners or coal managers. Those 20,000 coalminers were sacrificing their income, they were sacrificing their families' welfare, they were sacrificing their material security and comfort in order to seek to protect the Australian coal industry and to seek to protect Australian coal export earnings. That is why they were demonstrating. That is why they were on strike. That is why they were forfeiting their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe now that it was probably coincidental that Minister Brereton announced that the government was going to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said that the government proposed to bring the coal industry under the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. There was an unfortunate conjunction of circumstances at that time. It was widely interpreted as a pre-emptive and punitive attack on coalminers and on their union. But I am now convinced that the association of events was more coincidental than deliberate. However, it was unfortunate that the minister referred to what he described as the union's contempt for the tribunal's rulings in the context of that announcement about his proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is overwhelming, undeniable and growing evidence that Australia's coal exports are being directed to buyers who play Australian coal suppliers off against one another to the disadvantage of Australian coal exporters, coalminers, the coalmining communities and Australia's export earnings. That loss of Australian export earnings could have amounted to about $30 billion over the last 10 years. That represents about 20 per cent of Australia's total net foreign debt. It could be as high as that. I believe it is a figure approaching that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will have more to say about that issue later, but I simply make the point now that the Rae Taylor inquiry agreed to take the evidence of the coalmining executives in camera. Why did it choose to do that? Why was it prevailed upon to do that and why did it choose to do that? It chose to do that because of the concern that any adverse evidence given by coalmining executives to that inquiry about some overseas coal buyers would lead to possible punitive, retaliatory action against them by overseas coal buyers. There is plenty more evidence, and I will refer to that from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Mining</EMPHASIS> in May of this year, the Executive Director of the New South Wales Coal Association, Richard John, was reported as having made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coal is no different from the rest of Australian industry and the inward-looking, industry-focused Coal Industry Tribunal is inappropriate to a leading export industry. An outward-looking, enterprise-focused system, as applies under the Industry Relations Commission, is vital to the coal industry's international competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA>His opening words were, `Coal is no different from the rest of Australian industry.' Let me say very clearly, very firmly and very emphatically that it is different. The coalmining industry is the most dangerous large-scale industry in Australia, or for that matter anywhere in the world. Explosions, gas and roof cave-ins cause injury and death to hundreds of coalminers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier I was born into a coalmining community. I was born into a coalmining family in Pelaw Main on the northern coalfields. Every family in that town&mdash;it was a pit town&mdash;had the scars of either family injury or family death. The graves in the cemeteries of the northern coalfields bear testimony to some of the disasters which have occurred there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said my father carted pit timber to hold up the roofs under which my grandfathers, my uncles and my cousins dug coal. My grandfather died of lung disease which had been compounded by coaldust. He left a young widow with seven children. My uncle also died in his early 30s from similar causes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the primary school that I went to, when the pit whistle went during the day the class would freeze because the pit whistle did not go unless some accident or something similar had happened. The kids would wonder whether it was dad or grandad or Uncle Tom or an older brother who could have been injured or killed. So do not let anyone, including the Executive Director of the New South Wales Coal Association, tell me that the coal industry is the same as every other industry; it is not. Nor should anyone try to tell that to the people of Moura, where in the last 20 years I think about 35 men have been killed in a community of 2,000 people. Do not let anyone ever tell me that there is nothing special or especially difficult about the coalmining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, all of these factors tend to occur in isolated or remote areas where coal is the only substantial economic support. In the area I come from, up until the 1950s there were 24 operating coalmines; there is now one and it has been open since then, all the others having closed. The closures were particularly difficult for those communities, which depended so exclusively on coal. The fact that we were close to Newcastle meant that other opportunities became available, but that is not always the case in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry is also the biggest export earner, so it is important to Australia generally. It provides $7 1/2 billion per year at the present time. Time will not allow me to go on to indicate other factors about the coalmining industry which make it unique. When an industry is unique and deserving of unique responses and unique arrangements, it should be provided with them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has handled this particular matter particularly poorly. But that is not really surprising because the Minister for Industrial Relations has rolled over so many times in the last year and a half that it is now getting difficult to count them. This is just one more example of a Minister for Industrial Relations backflip. On this side of the House we have decided to call him the minister for chaos.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that at the end of the day, the Government will achieve its objective of mainstreaming the coal industry into the rest of the industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>But on 11 October he rolled over again. Why? Because John Maitland, President of the United Mineworkers Federation said, `Laurie, it ain't on.' He told Mr Brereton that it was not on; the union was not going to let him do what had been recommended as far back as the Hancock commission. It was back in 1985 that the Hancock inquiry recommended full abolition of the Coal Industry Tribunal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue today is just one more example of how divisive and how confused this minister is. What he has given us now does not fully subsume the tribunal within the Industrial Relations Commission but rather brings it within the ambit of the Industrial Relations Commission as a specialist panel. The real hooker is that that panel must take account of prior determinations in the industry by the Coal Industry Tribunal. If the commission is supposed to operate properly, why on earth does it have to take account of prior decisions? Why can management and the coal unions not come to agreement about a particular aspect of their working hours, their pay rates or how the industry operates and take it to the commissioner to have it ratified? Why, if it decides to do something different, does it have to take account of prior decisions? It beats the heck out of me. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I remember Keating saying to us once, There's something wrong with a political system where this bloke could become Minister for Transport!</PARA>
<PARA>Well, he did, didn't he? We are stuck with him as Minister for Transport, Minister for Industrial Relations and minister for backflips. How many have we gone through? It started with the Industrial Relations Reform Act, which was going to be the mother of change in the industrial relations arena in Australia. It was going to give employers who had non-union work forces the opportunity to negotiate directly with their work forces on strike agreements. It was going to reduce awards over time to core conditions and really expand the enterprise bargaining system. But what it did was re-regulate the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Charlton said two things today that I want to talk about briefly. He said he was all for reducing legalism and regulation in the area of industrial relations. I agree with him; but legalism is exactly what the minister reintroduced into the system when be brought in the Industrial Relations Reform Act. The system is now so legalistic and so complex that even the practitioners cannot sort out how it is supposed to operate, and neither can the commissioners. They themselves are confused about what the limits of their powers are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limits of those powers are becoming terribly concerning. Last week the Industrial Relations Commission gave the teachers' unions in Victoria the right to sit on a panel to determine which new teachers a principal at a state owned high school or primary school will hire. The new Kennett government set up a system called schools of the future. That allows a committee made up largely of parents, with oversight by the education department, to hire its own principal, and it allows the principal to select his staff. But the Industrial Relations Commission says, `No. There has to be a veto over a principal having the right to hire his own staff.' If we spread that throughout the community, we will have to give the unions the right of veto over hiring for every private company and every public sector employer in Australia. Is that what the member for Charlton wants? I think it is probably not. It is increasing the regulation and the legalism of the system beyond acceptable bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Charlton also supports compulsory union membership. I find those two views to be diametrically opposed. They are completely incompatible. In the first place, his view that we should have compulsory union membership is absolutely patronising. How about all those people in the gallery? How about the eight million Australians in the work force today? The member for Charlton says, `None of you is capable of making decisions by yourself. You need a union bureaucrat to make the decisions for you. You have to have the protection of a union bureaucrat.' What a lot of nonsense. That is absolute nonsense, and it is absolutely opposed to his concept that we should have less regulation in industry. What does he want to do? Does he want to deregulate the industries and let the unions run the whole country? That gets right down to the crux of the matter of what the member for Charlton very possibly&mdash;I do not want to accuse the member unfairly&mdash;is indicating that he will support.

Time and time again, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations have come into this place and talked about what a wonderful experience the waterfront reform has been, how well we now perform and how we are moving more containers per hour.

The point I was trying to make is that, in area after area, this minister is subject to intense pressure lobbying, either by his mates in the ALP or by his mates in the broader union movement. I think that is no better demonstrated than in statements that were made by John Maitland on 11 October, when he was talking to Monica Attard. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister had given us an undertaking that he would tell us what was taking place with the future of the Coal Industry Tribunal. That didn't happen.</PARA>
<PARA>That did not happen. The minister did not go and talk to the unions as he promised to. Mr Maitland continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was essentially a sneaky act that took place this morning, I think essentially to catch us off guard. Secondly, I had specifically asked the committee&mdash;and that is the Economics and Industrial Relations Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the ALP caucus, I assume&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the opportunity to address it on this specific issue.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, the Industrial Relations Minister, Mr Brereton&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is Monica Attard talking&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has defended the changes to the Coal Industry Tribunal. He says the tribunal will continue to operate in a modified form for at least the next two years before it's integrated into the mainstream industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA>That was on 11 October, and now we have a different situation again. So this particular proposal has changed and changed. I return to what the member for Charlton had to say earlier when he referred to the necessity for those people who want to work in coal mines and in the broader coal industry to be members of the union. It is clear the preference for trade unions is desired by the trade union officials, and the reason for that is fairly obvious: the more members, the more money; the more money, the more the control; the larger the bureaucracy in the union movement, the more control it has over the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out time and time again, however&mdash;by no lesser people than the Industry Commission and the OECD&mdash;that if Australia wants to be competitive in international circles it needs to free up its industrial relations system and needs to allow flexibility. Why do we need that flexibility? It is because specific areas such as the coal industry need to modernise their operations, need to modernise their thinking, need to modernise their approach. The individuals who work in that industry need to be able to participate in making that industry profitable. If they cannot, there will not be any jobs there tomorrow and there will not be any jobs for their children the day after tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without an enhanced degree of flexibility we have little hope of modernising our economy and stopping the inexorable rise of interest rates, which shortly will start to kill off demand and slow our growth. Without basic, essential change to allow freedom of choice in our industrial relations system, we are not going to make the gains in the rest of this century that we desperately need to make in order to modernise our economy. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My response to that proposed amendment is, `Why not hit us with a feather duster or a limp lettuce leaf?' If the best that an amendment to a bill that we are seriously debating in this house can do is to admonish the minister, how is that going to effect good government or improve the working of a bill before the House? It is just a pathetic response to the fact that, as has been mentioned by my colleagues the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and&mdash;in the second reading speech&mdash;the Minister for Industrial Relations  on this matter the opposition once more has nowhere to go. I will refer to the honourable member for Bennelong again later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) mentioned the donation from the mineworkers union to the ALP. Shock, horror! Fancy, people make donations to political parties! One does not hear this side of the house getting up and saying that because the opposition got so many thousands of dollars from big business it is a captive. I was a recipient of wonderful support from the mineworkers in central Queensland and I owe them a great debt. It helped me to become the member for Capricornia. One can be sure that, irrespective of how much they supported my campaign, I would be representing their interests because I come from a coalmining community and, unlike some of the honourable members opposite, I know the difficulties, I have seen tragedies such as were recounted by my colleague the honourable member for Charlton. We have only to think about the current mining warden's inquiry into the latest Moura disaster to see why the coal industry sees itself as different and unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland quoted some statistics. The way statistics are interpreted is the key issue, but I wish to comment on one part of the statistics in the sheet that I think has been incorporated into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is that 50 per cent of all disputes relating to working conditions, including safety, occur in the coal industry. That is a fairly important statistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is that so? It is because of the nature of the work and the danger of the work. It is telling that miners do not strike over irrelevant issues. The miners union is becoming increasingly sophisticated. It strikes on issues such as the future of the industry. That was basically what the major protest in Canberra was about earlier this year. The miners were expressing their concerns about how coal was going to be marketed and how we were going to maintain the coal industry and the coalmining communities of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of work safety and working conditions, the miners have certainly been pro-active. I support that. Obviously those who have lost husbands, sons, fathers and friends in the latest disaster, and in all mining accidents, have suffered long-term hurt and stress. The impact on those people's fellow workers has also been critical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned before in the House that in the mining towns where I worked I encountered miners from all over the country who had been affected directly or indirectly by mining accidents. Those miners carry a great burden in terms of stress and ill health which affects them every time they go down the pit. It certainly affects their families. We are dealing with a dangerous industry. That is not to say that there are not other dangerous industries in the wider economic landscape, but there is no doubt that coalmining is a very dangerous industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the 75th anniversary meeting of the International Labour Organisation which was held this year. That much maligned person, Mr John Maitland, was at that meeting. As a very important working member of the Safety and Health in Mines Working Party, Mr Maitland was given accolades by an employer representative on that working party. Mr Pirie from Canada was talking about the importance of having the convention ratified. The convention will be further discussed in June 1995, following consultations with governments around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to indicate that the Australian government is already participating in those consultations with, apart from the CFMEU, other industry groups. This government has always had a very strong commitment to International Labour Organisation conventions. I look forward to the time when this convention on safety and health in mines will be ratified by this government and will provide a benchmark on mine safety in this country. Mr Pirie said the following about John Maitland:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously, my preceding comments reflect philosophical differences between ourselves and some of the others involved in this process. Nevertheless, our discussions were conducted in an informative, cooperative and civil manner. Much of the credit for that goes to Mr Maitland, Worker member and Vice-Chairman. While we obviously have different viewpoints and methods, I sincerely admire and respect his devotion and dedication.</PARA>
<PARA>The much maligned mine workers of Australia play an important role at the international level. Why is it important that, not just in Australia but around the world, we remind ourselves of the importance of safety and health in mines? Mr Bekes, the government adviser from Hungary and Chairman of the Committee on Safety and Health in Mines made a pertinent point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is considered that over 1 million miners suffer from occupational injury or disease, and around 15,000 miners are killed at their workplaces each year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go back to the contribution from the member for Bennelong, because he has some history of dealing at an industrial relations level with mine workers in this country. The best the opposition has done in this debate is have a go at the federal minister and accuse him of rolling over and backflips, and I will refer to that in a moment. At one stage the member for Bennelong, who is currently opposition spokesperson on industrial relations, was the federal Treasurer. He was Treasurer during a very famous taxation and housing dispute in Blackwater, one of the towns in my electorate. I must remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that coal miners have long memories and they have never forgotten the member for Bennelong and Doug Anthony coming to Blackwater. There were many weeks of industrial disputation, which, as you may recall, was to do with whether mine workers would be taxed on their subsidised housing. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 2 September 1980:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall cost of the dispute so far has been calculated at close to $500 million, with most of the burden being carried by the major mining companies, BHP, CSR-Thiess, Central Queensland Coal Associates and the Utah Development Company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These companies have been losing in excess of $25 million a week since the strike began and all declared force majeure before it entered its fourth week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mining unions last week attempted to offer the Federal Government a compromise under which their housing rental tax could be redefined as a housing allowance. However, this was rejected by the Government on the basis that it did not alter the position the miners found themselves in.</PARA>
<PARA>It was the unwillingness of the federal Treasurer of the time to negotiate an effective compromise that led to major disruption to the industry and major loss of earnings to the mining industry, mine workers, the Queensland government and the federal government of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in the end a compromise was found and it was the then federal Treasurer who had to do a bit of a backflip. Finally the strike was negotiated when Dr Llew Edwards, at the time the Queensland Treasurer, found some information about previous housing taxation proposals.

<PARA>While the member for Bennelong and his colleagues who have spoken in this debate have been bagging the excellently negotiated compromise, the coal owners are getting on with the reality of the situation. In a press release, John Maitland from the CFMEU acknowledged the role of the minister. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Also Laurie Brereton must be thanked. He is a tough negotiator but we've worked our way through it all," Mr Maitland said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Mr Maitland said the union had not got everything it wanted. "We have agreed to disagree with the government on some matters," Mr Maitland said.</PARA>
<PARA>The position of the CFMEU from day one of this dispute was that it wanted to make sure that the concerns and interests of its members, who provide through their labour a massive export earning capacity to this country, were addressed and that it could negotiate a solution that was in the interests of not only its members but also the industry and the others involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This press release demonstrates how effective we on this side of the House have been.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been able to achieve that because we work together.

Until the opposition is prepared to leave to one side its closed ideological positions, it is not going to be seen as having a great deal of credibility either in this place or in the media.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members should note that at the same time as the member for Bennelong is castigating the minister he is also changing his views on his sacred cow&mdash;one that he has held very firm for a great deal of time&mdash;industrial relations policy generally. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 9 November, Michael Millett reports:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was designed to trigger a mass exodus from the award system by automatically cancelling Federal awards (the so-called "big bang"), forcing workers into contract bargaining if they could not reach prior agreement with employers on maintaining their existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>This was a key issue that went against the opposition in the run-up to the last election. The opposition tried what it could. Its last desperate press releases prior to 13 March indicated that the opposition knew it was on a loser. Whether or not people are union members, they were not prepared to see the safety that unions have given them over the years stripped away. Unless the coalition improves its track record on these matters it will not go out with a big bang, it will go out with a pathetic whimper. It appears the member for Bennelong might well have unrequited ambitions to the leadership, and it is a tribute to the desperation of the opposition that he is once again being resurrected as a possible opposition leader.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not talking about the changes and requirements necessary to look after the safety and basic working conditions of the coal workers of this country. We are talking about the flagrant abuse of instructions by a tribunal, in this case the matter of protesting over discounted coal prices to Japanese buyers. I think it is very important that we get this clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people realise that this coalition is not about not supporting better conditions and safer practices, but about trying to deliver fairness and equity to all Australians in the industrial relations system. At that time, when coal industry workers were protesting over discounted coal prices to Japanese buyers, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was interviewed on radio. He made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, let me say, it's been there for a long time&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the tribunal&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and I think it's done a very good job in many respects, but it's equally clear, as a result of the course of action of the Mineworkers' Union over recent months, that the union is not prepared to take any notice of it at all and its orders. And it's against that background that I think it's appropriate that it should be brought within the mainstream of industrial relations in Australia, and that is the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the Minister for Industrial Relations in an interview on the radio program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 19 April 1994. This bill is another example of the extent to which the federal Labor government will bend over backwards to satisfy the demands and conditions of unions, irrespective of the consequences of such action to the rest of the people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to focus for a moment on the amendments that relate to industrial relations in the coal industry, in particular, the intention of the amendments. Within these parameters the bill seeks to amend the Industrial Relations Act 1988 and the Coal Industry Act 1946 to make provision for the Commonwealth to reform the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes in the coalmining industry. For reasons which I will explain later, these amendments contribute little to the labour market reform that this bill purports to deliver, or to achieving high levels of productivity and international competitiveness in the Australian economy. Again, I would like to read the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the One Nation document, which the government released on 26 February 1992. The Prime Minister had this to say about a more competitive and stronger Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nation, like all successful nations, where employers and workers pool their creativity and energy to transform workplaces.</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that he said `employers and employees pool their creativity and energy to transform workplaces'. The Prime Minister made it clear that that is one of the strong agendas of the government. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I want to keep up the pace of change. I want Australia to be fiercely competitive in the world&mdash;so that we can deliver opportunity and care at home.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want us to be strong within, so we can be strong in the world&mdash;a world which too often does not compete fairly.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not have any problem with that. I recognise that if we do not have economic prosperity we cannot deliver the social programs that make the lives of all Australians easier and the social reform that all of us are happy to have. So I have no query with that at all. What I do query is the fact that, in the last 10 years, the Prime Minister and this government have constantly harped at business about being more competitive, about getting its act together, about downsizing and about improving its whole approach to business. What do we see the government do? We see it fiddle with a bill that should have been fixed 10 years ago. Even when the government does bring legislation into the House to amend the current arrangements that have been talked about for 10 years, it still cannot get it right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address the operation of the coal industry before the tribunal. At present the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, since April this year, the Industrial Relations Court of Australia are responsible for almost all of Australia's industrial arrangements. The coal industry, however, has had its own industrial relations structure through the Coal Industry Act 1946. Unions and employers in the coal industry work within the specialist Coal Industry Tribunal, with its own jurisdiction covering New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been criticisms of the Coal Industry Tribunal. These arrangements have been subject to criticisms from various arenas in past years. The Coal Industry Tribunal has been unable to adequately handle industrial relations issues and it has been unable to successfully settle disputes, mainly because the unions would not adhere to the coal tribunal's decisions; they would totally ignore them, as we saw in April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Mineworkers Union has been strong in often ignoring the tribunal's decisions. Another source of criticism is the selective and specialist nature of the tribunal. It falls outside the jurisdiction of mainstream Australian industrial relations and, as such, is not subject to the same standards, decisions or processes that govern other Australian industries. Employers in the New South Wales Coal Association have been calling for the coal industry to be brought into the mainstream for the last 10 years. As far back as 1985, the Hancock inquiry recommended that the Coal Industry Tribunal be abolished. That was recommended in 1985 in the Hancock inquiry. The coalition has always supported the position that the coal industry should be brought into the mainstream industrial relations system and that the tribunal be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations has, until now, made no attempt to hide the need for such reform. In fact, in that interview I have just quoted from, he openly supported it, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say today that I believe and the Government believes that the decision of the Mineworkers' Union to take industrial action each time they're dissatisfied with the outcome of coal price negotiations is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. It's doing great damage to this industry . . .  . . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .. the union is not prepared to take any notice of it at all and its orders.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that in talking of the Coal Industry Tribunal. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's high time that, given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and I'll be taking steps to put that into effect.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the minister's own words. But what do we see? The minister's rhetoric is clear; he leaves no room for any misunderstanding as to his intention. As he stated, the reform that is required will be achieved only by fully abolishing the Coal Industry Tribunal and bringing the industry directly into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations, under the clear jurisdiction and control of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy has been put on the public record. However, if Labor's previous record is any guide, what it promises to do often bears little or no resemblance to what is actually done at the end of the day. It is all right to get up and talk about it and make a lot of you-beaut public statements about it; but, at the end of the day, people want to see some action. We are not in this place just to stand and yack away without delivering real reform and benefits to the Australian people. This bill is no exception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for actual reform from these amendments, contrary to the minister's pronouncement and the government's clear policy commitment, the bill actually provides for the creation of a new specialist coal panel to operate within the commission. I have to say that these are gains, and I support the small gains that have been made. I know that employers in the industry also support these gains because they are a move forward. But, as a result of 10 years of talking and working, these are very small gains indeed. They are just a few crumbs that have fallen from the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part of the bill ensures that the new panel will have to take tribunal decisions into account when dealing with coal matters. On the surface, these amendments would appear to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal and bring the coal industry into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations. But appearances are deceiving. In reality, these amendments fail to achieve any of the reforms publicly promised by the minister. What the minister has done is to effectively maintain the status quo by moving the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Industrial Relations Commission but&mdash;wait for it&mdash;under a new name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only yesterday that I stood at this dispatch box and talked about the new names for measures within the Social Security Act; namely, the home child-care allowance and parenting allowances. Once again, we have seen this wonderful sleight of hand trick where all the government does is put new headings on everything, put them into language that is not understood by any of the people who have to use the service and say that it has made a wonderful reform. It just has not happened. The hypocrisy of the amendments in this particular bill lies in the fact that, whilst the name of the tribunal is to be changed, the new panel created to replace it will still be a separate and specialist body. The only substantial difference the bill makes is that the new panel will operate within the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, although, importantly, still effectively outside the jurisdiction of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no new members on the new panel from other panels within the commission. The same specialist members from the old tribunal will still sit on the new panel, and those members will not sit on any of the commission's other panels. Unfortunately, these amendments will do little more than make an unsatisfactory act somewhat less unsatisfactory. They will still leave the act as a flawed piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly of no surprise to me that the minister's amendments, which are supposed to deliver the promised reforms, are not unlike the minister's recent handling of his other portfolios. Whatever happened to the government and the minister's promises to fully absorb the Coal Industry Tribunal and to bring this industry directly into mainstream industrial relations system under the clear jurisdiction and control of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission? All the bill confirms is that nothing has changed in relation to Labor's approach to government and the much needed micro-economic reforms that could deliver what the Prime Minister has promised here or what he said he wants for Australia&mdash;that is, for us to be strong within so that we can be strong in the world, a world which too often does not compete fairly. They promise everything and worry about it later. There will always be some excuse to justify the failure to deliver what was originally promised. Needless to say, the bill is far from satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One has to wonder why this breakdown has occurred. As I have said, we have seen a lot of rhetoric about the need for reform. It has been clearly acknowledged. It is on the record. More importantly, why has the government procrastinated for so long on the issue? What is the motive behind the seemingly absurd action? When one contemplates the hostile relationship that currently exists between the Minister for Industrial Relations and these particular union officials and others around the country, and when one considers the obvious contempt that some of these officials have shown for the minister, I suppose the answer becomes reasonably obvious. He does not want to rock the boats in those groups that have become the new elite in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always find it fascinating and interesting when I sit on the bench to listen to the Prime Minister at the dispatch box slating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), saying that he belongs to the Melbourne Club and that he is an elitist. These people have made elitism into an art form. They have been just amazing. This whole thing is about protecting sectional interests at the expense of all Australians, and that is just not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has been doing what it does best, and that is kowtowing to the demands of its union colleagues and stitching up deals that give more power and authority, with flagrant disregard for the consequences of those actions for Australian industry and Australian people at large. It is obvious that Labor has reneged on its promises and weakened the amendments in this bill to keep favour with the unions. By ensuring that the Coal Industry Tribunal effectively stays the same organisation, although now under a different name within the commission, the unions are kept happy and the minister is saved from what would no doubt be another embarrassing and damaging confrontation with senior union officials and members of his own party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, I find it quite ironic that the Prime Minister has the hide to accuse the coalition of being a party of Melbourne Club elitists. I certainly was not. My father worked in the railways for many years. I am sure that many other colleagues come from similar backgrounds. There is nothing particularly elite about that. My father was a hard worker, and I am proud of what he achieved in his lifetime and of the example that he set for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not only does this bill highlight its watered down form; it reveals the weak and uncommitted approach that characterises the current Labor government when it comes to taking action to implement the required micro-economic reform that is so vital to Australia's economic competitiveness. One only needs to consider the recent decision by the federal government to exempt Australia's major shipping line from key provisions of the Trade Practices Act to realise the full extent to which Labor's short-sighted union agenda is corrupting essential competition reform which underpins the very essence of micro-economic reform in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no shortage of evidence to reflect current federal government policy, which is at odds with the policy of increasing economic competition. Here we have a government that has spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, again propping up a shipping line that the minister himself admitted was worthless and not able to be sold on the open market. Yet we hear time and again in this place and in other places the admonition&mdash;constant harping&mdash;by the government and its representatives that our industries, private industries and businesses ought to become competitive. The government moved a lot of tariff barriers because it felt our companies had to learn to stand on their own two feet. It is one rule for the government and another rule for the rest of the people out there, except for those who happen to belong to the elite club. They are okay because they are part of the boys' club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications for Australia of such actions are reflected in the absurdity of this bill. Yet they will be lauded by Labor's mates out there in the elite club. My concern is the implication this has for the hundreds of thousands of small business proprietors in this country who deserve to have delivered what the Prime Minister promised but are not getting any example from the top. I always believe that, if you are going to call on other people to improve or mend their ways, then the leader had better start taking note of his own advice and get on with improving his own lot. It is high time that the government set the lead and got its own management ship in order both in this government and outside. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is supposed to be about industrial relations, but instead it started out as a clash of philosophies and degenerated into a battle between two teams which either supported Australian coalminers or wanted to kick them. This has been a wide ranging debate, and I will continue in that vein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess you would have to say it has been a battle between political ideologues who know nothing about coalmining and members of coalmining electorates who understand the industry, know its harshness, know its dangers and support the position of the coalminers. Let there be no doubt about my position. The miners have absolute right on their side and they have my unqualified support. I congratulate the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) for being willing to listen to the arguments put forward by the miners and for agreeing to compromise so that we have been able to reach a solution which, though not perfectly satisfactory to me, seems to offer a good deal of protection for the miners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a few facts about coal to set the scene. The coal industry is a $7 billion per year export industry. Australia is the world's largest coal exporter. We need a stable, efficient and prosperous coal industry. Under a federal Labor government, coal will remain strong and my workers will be treated fairly. They will not be subjected to the worker bashing that the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and some of those opposite would care to inflict on coalminers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Bennelong accuses this government of being soft on coalminers. Rubbish! I cannot help worrying when he calls us soft on coalminers. What degree of softness existed on the other side of the House when the bottom of the harbour schemes were flourishing? I would be very hesitant to accuse those opposite of being soft on big business. The member for Bennelong also predicted that I will lose my seat at the next election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speech of the honourable member for Bennelong was a rather rambling one. It could have been a leadership speech.

While they might have that tory view of industrial relations, they do not dig down deeply. They do not try to understand the intricacies of an industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To solve all the problems of Australia the opposition would use the poor old worker. All he would have to do is work harder and longer for less pay and the miracle would then occur. Suddenly we would become a wondrous country. Coalminers know that the coalition seeks minimisation of miners' wages and maximisation of company profits. Miners know that and they vote accordingly&mdash;I think about 90 per cent for Labor. Miners are the natural enemies of toryism and of those who want to rob workers of a fair day's wage for a fair day's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Miners are sensible. They know that good industrial relations are a crucial component of good economic performance. Miners want good economic performance because they want to keep their jobs. It should not be assumed that all coal industry strikes are the fault of the mine workers. Today's coalminers are far more sophisticated than their forebears. I know there are ridiculous stories of the old days. For example, if a race meeting was on in Cessnock they would say that the pit ponies' breath was a bit off and have a strike. But we have come a long way since then.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has the most productive underground mines in the world and the second most productive open cut mines. Productivity increases since 1980 have averaged over five per cent per year. Australian mineworkers average 43 hours per week, probably the highest for any industry in Australia. They are working harder and longer because they agreed to make sacrifices to achieve restructuring. Because they have done that, our coal industry faces a bright future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalminers' wages would be less than the wages of those who attend Liberal-National Party fundraising functions&mdash;and the coalition does not complain about their incomes. Consider the dirt that the coalminer has to contend with underground. Consider the insecurity of jobs in the coalmining industry. Consider the deaths in the coalmining industry. A friend of mine lost her husband, and after five years of recovering from that she lost her son in a coalmine. If you drive around Wallsend, Cessnock and some of those places, you can name a person in every street who has died as a result of dust or a mining disaster. Before I spoke on this debate, the honourable member for Pearce referred to the deaths and injuries which occurred recently at Moura. Do not begrudge miners their salary. I can tell you that I am glad I am here. I would rather be here than down a coalmine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies carried out showed that mine labour costs are not due merely to miners. Some mines belonging to large mining companies have 30 per cent of all employees engaged in management and administration. The truth is that, despite increasing productivity, despite lowering working costs of production, despite working new shift arrangements, despite agreeing to other new work practices and despite the development and implementation of industry based training and multiskilling through the development of work models and industry training schemes, most underground miners have not had a rise in their base rate of pay since June 1991.

A fairer price for our export coal means far more to Australians than does this legislation we are debating here today. If opposition members really want to improve the coalmining industry, let them sit down late at night and read some of the facts and figures about our coal exports to Japan and how we are played off a break by the coal purchasers in this country.

Does the Prime Minister stand by his statement that 15 per cent wage increases over two years are eminently affordable in national economic terms, or does he now subscribe to the view of the Treasurer, who told the House on Tuesday that such claims will be damaging to the economy and are not consistent with the inflation objective and that he hoped they were only ambit claims?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of enterprise bargaining is being done. Good managers and managements and good unions are getting together and drawing substantial productivity yields from businesses which are being split between wages and profits. The key question is: what is the productivity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these claims are for one year, two years or three years. If they are over a longer period and there is a productivity yield, the cost to the company, at a period of high profitability&mdash;and hence, therefore, the carry-on into prices and into the inflation rate&mdash;will be, of course, minimal. So the aim of the game is to lift productivity and to see that people making wage settlements do it in a way that takes account of the overall profitability of companies both from the volumes in the economy now and from the improved productivity. Hence, there should then be less impact on prices and on the inflation rate. That is as it will be in many cases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, claims are not necessarily agreements, but there will be agreements at some point. So, in the past, when we saw wage break-outs in the late 1970s and early 1980s, these were for overaward payments. In the 1980s, we saw wages basically held in line and inflation tracked down under the accord arrangements with a centralised system. That has gone for the large part of the work force. We are now in an enterprise bargaining system. With an enterprise bargaining system there is a responsibility on employers to know that they are now in the world of making arrangements themselves and there is no recourse to a centralised tribunal or jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made this point the other day. I noticed that a couple of commentators said, `How dare the Prime Minister say that the employers have got a responsibility in this?' Is it not in for a dig to actually suggest that the employers might not be doing the right thing here or that there is an obligation on them to actually bargain and secure productivity arrangements and improvements and to not see an impact on their prices and the inflation rate? One commentator, who has said the same thing for the last 15 years, said, `What's wrong with the wage arrangements? We still have the award underpinnings.' I am completely at a loss to understand what the award underpinnings have to do with anybody outside the safety net arrangements.</PARA>

Yes, we have got a better inflation performance, but it's not over a long period of time. In the meantime, we're going to factor in a five to six per cent inflation rate.' It is pretty hard to go and say to an ordinary person on the factory floor, `Listen, make sure that you've got less than a two per cent claim.

Is the Prime Minister aware of government figures released yesterday which show that, in the International Year of the Family, his government's policies have led to a situation where one in 10 traditional families have both parents&mdash;not one parent&mdash;out of work? The figures also reveal that almost 19 per cent of Australia's children aged under 15&mdash;some 700,000&mdash;live in a family with no breadwinner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> is grossly misleading because it gives the impression that 10 per cent of traditional families have both husband and wife unemployed. That is not the case. The proportion of couples in traditional families who are both unemployed is 1.3 per cent&mdash;not 10. Although unemployment is still high, the unemployment rate for families with children has decreased over the last 18 months and will continue to fall. That is, as I indicated earlier, the growth in employment which we are seeing&mdash;the aggregate growth in employment and the growth in employment for the long-term unemployed&mdash;is having that impact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation document is the largest, most comprehensive package of measures the Commonwealth has ever employed to deal with unemployed people, particularly those who have been long-term unemployed. In its first full year of operations, $2.2 billion will be spent providing around 650,000 labour market program places for unemployed people. Of course, we will provide a job guarantee with those.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, on Monday I went through the benefits in terms of transfer payments to low income families and also the latest changes to be introduced by the government: the home child-care allowance and the generalised child-care rebate. In the white paper, Working Nation, the new parenting allowance for the spouses of unemployed people and low paid workers will help their family incomes and give families more choice for one parent to stay home and care for children. I might also remind the House that we have changed the taper on the benefit so that people now taking part-time or casual jobs will receive a top-up because there will not be a dollar for dollar withdrawal of the taper from those benefits.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we are to build real confidence in a system of private funding of retirement incomes&mdash;a system which is acknowledged as necessary because of changing demographics&mdash;it is time for a bipartisan approach to superannuation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say how he had been talking to the opposition and understood that it was prepared to reconsider its policy and that he was trying to assist it to do that. I guess that indicates quite clearly that the president of the superannuation funds association is saying on behalf of the industry that it is concerned that the opposition policy in relation to the superannuation guarantee, which is to cap the super guarantee at whatever level it is if and when it gets into office, is an inappropriate one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the industry that has concern about that. I yesterday released preliminary findings of some market research which we have undertaken which shows that there is concern in the community about the future possibility of a change in the rules relating to the SGC because of the opposition's policy about capping it at whatever level it is if and when it comes into office. So you have concern at the industry and community levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a valid concern, given that not only was that the opposition policy at the last election but it also reconfirmed it in that document laughingly described as The Things That Matter. Today we see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> an article by Dr FitzGerald headed `Common ground on super could prove nation's saving grace'. He calls in that article for members of the opposition to adopt the full implementation of the super guarantee and to jettison this policy of capping it at whatever level it is if and when they get into office. His support for the super guarantee is in full accord with what he said in his report last year. He said that the superannuation guarantee would add over 1 1/2 per cent of GDP because of the compulsory aspect. That is a very important point. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key element producing increased saving over the longer term through the superannuation guarantee is that it is compulsory, raising the saving of many who without it would not be saving much in any form.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his statement last year in producing his report on national saving. His article today goes on to say that the opposition's policy of not supporting that super guarantee and increasing compulsory saving is the wrong policy and that the opposition should change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of concern about the opposition's policy. Of course, at the level of individuals in the country, of people who would be affected by that policy, there is great reason to be concerned. If the opposition were to get into office&mdash;and that seems highly unlikely&mdash;and implement this capping policy, it would mean a tremendous reduction in the retirement incomes of those people who are dependent on the SGC for their retirement benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated to the House earlier this year, if the opposition's policy were to be implemented and assuming continuing low inflation, someone who was earning $600 a year at age 25 and who retired at age 65 would have his or her retirement income benefit reduced by $120,000. That would reduce the retirement income by about a quarter. It would have a tremendous effect on individuals in this country. So there is industry concern, community concern, a concern in relation to national saving, and an impact on individuals in terms of their retirement incomes which is very substantial indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is obviously a policy that has to be changed. The opposition's policy at the moment is to go back to the policy that existed in the John Howard days, when the member for Bennelong was the Treasurer. He had a system of very generous tax concessions for superannuation. How many people were covered? About 40 per cent of the work force were covered by superannuation. Today, 89 per cent are covered. Who were that 40 per cent? Overwhelming they were the people on higher incomes. Lower income people, of course, had nothing from superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation element is a very important aspect of how this government has looked after people on lower incomes by greatly improving the prospects they will have for a higher retirement income. The opposition really should rethink its policy. It is a policy which is disturbing to the community and the industry. It is contrary to the need for greater national saving and it will heavily penalise many workers whose only access to superannuation is through the SGC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Today the Prime Minister announced the establishment of a new EPAC task force on private sector involvement in public infrastructure. Can the minister advise the House of how public infrastructure funded by the better cities program is attracting major private sector investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lilley for his question. I want to refer particularly to an announcement by the Robina development group and the superannuation fund Commonwealth Funds Management of a $350 million investment in a new town centre in the Gold Coast. What is important about this investment is that it flows directly from a major piece of public infrastructure under the better cities program, that is, the rail line between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. That railway line is being jointly funded by the Commonwealth and the state, with about $400 million of public investment of which the Queensland government is contributing about $300 million. Robina and Commonwealth Funds Management have acknowledged that the rail link influenced their investment decision. They said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Robina Town Centre will be a terminus for the Federal Government funded $335 million Brisbane-Gold Coast electric rail link due for completion in 1997, as part of the Better Cities program. It will be the site for a future public hospital, high school and government offices.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a first-class example of the links between infrastructure and private investment. It shows cooperation between two levels of government&mdash;Commonwealth and state&mdash;and it provides a framework in which the Commonwealth and state governments can cooperate with local government within the planning policies for south-east Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astounded to hear the remarks of the opposition leader at the assembly of local government this week. The opposition leader suggested&mdash;in terms similar to those of opposition spokesmen on previous occasions&mdash;that the better cities program was one that was top down and involved no partnership and no recognition of the importance of intergovernmental cooperation. Indeed, with a reminder of the rather famous term `incentivation', which was introduced by a previous Leader of the Opposition, the opposition leader referred to a term which no doubt influenced his view of constitutional reform&mdash;`subsidiarity'. Apparently, subsidiarity means that the Commonwealth should show absolutely no leadership whatever and that, if the Commonwealth becomes involved in issues to do with state and local governments and if it becomes involved in issues that help to create better communities, as well as better cities, then somehow the Commonwealth exceeds its powers. It means that somehow the Commonwealth has got into areas that it ought to constitutionally stay out of; that it ought to have a policy of not being involved in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Yet, as the honourable member would know, even in his home state, only a few weeks ago we announced the Patawalonga project. This project, which is funded under the better cities program, involves cooperation between 11 units of local government together with cooperation with the state government that will result in a major clean-up of a polluted river system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the better cities program we are about ensuring that Commonwealth investment, together with state investment, in partnership with local government, makes a difference not in a particular project alone but in the shaping, planning and development of a region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No region of Australia is developing more quickly than south-east Queensland. No region of Australia demands more effective planning. We are effectively working with the Queensland government to provide that planning. We are putting some dollars in infrastructure investment into the development of infrastructure in south-east Queensland, and that is leading to very substantial private sector investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of the Robina development is a very important announcement. It shows the complete inability of the opposition to understand how to construct public policy in a way that recognises the legitimate role of the Commonwealth working in partnership with other spheres of government. I commend this announcement today to all members of the House. It is an important one and it illustrates how our policies work very effectively with the private sector to the benefit of the community and build a very strong community.</PARA>

That is in terms of income support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the rural adjustment scheme, there have been increased resources. The rural adjustment scheme is now a demand driven scheme, whereas before it was a cash limited scheme. If people want to avail themselves of support under the rural adjustment scheme or debt and have an interest rate subsidy paid to meet it and then use those funds on fodder, it is entirely up to each farmer and grazier to make their own choice. What we found, and what farm leaders have said in the past, is that fodder subsidies have been rorted by the fodder suppliers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the fact that nearly 9,000 certificates have been issued by RAS authorities to farmers in exceptional circumstance areas is an indication of how the policy is working. Those farmers who believe that they are viable, that they can take on carry-on finance and that RAS funds can meet the interest subsidy&mdash;by the way, another fib you have been putting around is that interest rates are rising and therefore the RAS payment will be of no benefit to farmers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has evidenced in the last few days and today at question time an uncharacteristic degree of sensitivity about the government's record in relation to the disparity between the richest Australians and the poorest Australians. He ought to be sensitive on these matters. When we look at his party's record of concern in past eras and when we look at his own comments and his rhetoric in the early period of his government, we can only be extremely disappointed in the result that has been achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to do two things today: I want to put clearly before the parliament once more the government's record, because it is something that ought to be etched in everybody's mind, and I want to clearly debunk the myths that the Prime Minister and his Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) are trying to develop to explain away what is occurring in Australia today. Quite frankly, those myths that they are trying to perpetuate by repeating them over and over again do not bear any real scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw a very telling article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> headed `Both parents jobless in 10pc of traditional families'. The Prime Minister took that report and said that the problem is with the presentation. He did not deny the figures. He wanted to try to dress them up in a different way so that nobody would understand what is happening in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the points are very clear. During Labor's period in office, the gap between rich and poor has widened. There is an underclass of people&mdash;Labor's underclass&mdash;which has been trapped in poverty and lacking in hope. The reality is that it has been created by the policies of the government itself. The government has not got the policies to redress it. This underclass has come into existence largely because of the continued unemployment that we experience today. That was a problem of Labor's creation; a result of its policies; a problem which, despite its record, it has proven incapable of solving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance relates to families in particular. The plight of families in this the International Year of the Family was shown in the figures released yesterday by the government Statistician in an Australian Bureau of Statistics publication. The points are very clear. The starkness can be simply seen when we use those figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one in 10 couple families&mdash;that is the term the Statistician uses; I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> still calls them traditional families&mdash;both parents are out of work. That is pretty stark. Almost 19 per cent&mdash;704&mdash;of Australia's children aged under 15 live in a family which has no breadwinner. One-quarter of Australian families&mdash;1.5 million&mdash;have no working member. The number of couple families&mdash;using the Statistician's formula&mdash;or traditional families falling into the category of unemployed and welfare dependent rose by 50 per cent from 1989 to 1993. Since this time, unemployment has dropped by only two percentage points, as the Prime Minister was reminding us today. This is notwithstanding the government's claims of a substantial economic recovery. The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not expect that situation to improve. A spokesman for the bureau was quoted in the same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you come out of a recession, things get better for a small percentage of people; there is always a group who continue to suffer under the improving conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a pity that the Prime Minister did not consider the plight of these people when he gave Australia the recession that he told us we had to have. But the suffering which this government has placed upon families and which was outlined in the same article by Bettina Cass, the chairwoman of the national council for the International Year of the Family, needs to be understood. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the plight of these families was the most urgent social issue facing the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>She was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The needs of families with unemployed workers must be of paramount consideration . . . About 50 per cent of the long-term unemployed have families; if we are ever going to get them back into the workforce we need to recognise their needs."</PARA>
<PARA>Very often, when I raise the question of unemployment, people come to me and say, `Well, what would you do about it?' We know that the government does not think we have any policies in this regard. But what I want to point out is that even the government's apologists have given up on it. Only this week in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> Ross Gittins, the economics editor, wrote an article under the heading `Keating the Great on downhill run'. He made this very simple observation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more you see of the Keating Government the more you come to the depressing conclusion that it's just not up to the challenge of managing the economy successfully . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious instance is Labor's chronic case of fiscal fatigue.</PARA>
<PARA>And this other quote, I think, deserves to be repeated again:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My desk calendar says there's a Spanish proverb to the effect that "what the fool does in the end the wise do in the beginning". I read that and thought of our cocksure Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But though Mr Keating's recalcitrance on fiscal policy is getting all the attention, the Government's loss of willpower on micro-economic reform is even more disillusioning. You see it in a succession of weak decisions which, though not major in themselves, add up to a Government that's given up the fight.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that there have been any more perspicacious, any more telling, comments about the government than those of Ross Gittins&mdash;a man, I have to say, whom I have frequently seen in all his writings as an apologist for the government. He has given up on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind people of what Helen Hughes said in this place because I thought her comments were even more alarming. When she was speaking before a parliamentary seminar on employment, she made the point that we are creating an underclass and that it is not an underclass that is of its own making but one that is being created by the way in which we run this economy. She went on to say this&mdash;and I think it is something that ought to be etched in the minds of every member of parliament and every Australian when they look at the government's policies of today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point I want to make is the Green Papers and the White Papers are not about employment they are about making unemployment palatable to the community and all I can say is that if we follow the policies of those papers then next time we have a recession unemployment will be who knows 12-14% or perhaps if we are a republic, we may be like the republic of Ireland where it is 15-16% because there is nothing in those papers that is real medicine it is as if the patient has TB and the papers are about bandages.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is any more telling comment about the government having given up. But, since Labor has come to power, the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. This is a fact. None of the Prime Minister's rhetoric&mdash;or I might say the minister's rhetoric&mdash;can disguise it. Taking inflation into account, the top 10 per cent of earners in Australia have seen their incomes rise by seven per cent since Labor took office, and over the same period real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of earners have fallen by five per cent. It is the policies of Labor that have polarised the Australian community into groups of high income earners and low income earners&mdash;and the gap is steadily increasing. Tables have been produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that amply demonstrate that. I would certainly like to read them, but that would only take up time unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Saunders, who directs for the government its Social Policy Research Centre, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is among the most unequal of the countries studied . . . despite many claims to the contrary. Australia's wage system, selective income tested social security system&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which the minister often says we ought to take into account&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and heavy reliance on progressive income tax have not, in fact, produced a more equal distribution of income than elsewhere. This naturally leads to the central question of why this is the case . . . one that poses a fundamental challenge for those who view Australia as an egalitarian country.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is the government's own adviser saying that the government's rhetoric is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have Ann Harding, whom the government quotes from favourably when it wants to justify an update to the Henderson poverty line. She recently put out her study, which I have quoted from before, to ACOSS. She is the head of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra. According to that study, Australia has one of the unfairest distributions of national income in the developed world. The top 20 per cent of our income earners get 42.1 per cent of total earnings, and the bottom 20 per cent get 5.4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When averaged out, the poorest 10 per cent of Australians have an equivalent income of $85 a week, while the richest 10 per cent have an equivalent income of $1,500 per week. The only Western country doing worse than Australia is Great Britain. The Harding study also shows that the difference between the rich and poor has got larger since Labor came to power. According to her, the rich have got richer at the expense of middle income earners, primarily because under Labor the incomes of the rich have accelerated while other incomes have barely changed. I encourage the minister to have a look at that again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Harding also indicated that the nature of poverty has changed. The major poverty problem in 1983 was with the aged. Since Labor came to power, it is now a working age phenomenon. It is a working age phenomenon because of the unemployment crisis created by the government. I would like to hear the Prime Minister try to explain why we have one in eight traditional families falling below the poverty line, why poverty is increasing in almost every group except the aged, and why of all Australians living in poverty just one half come from traditional nuclear families. In this International Year of the Family, I think we would all like to hear that explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When confronted by these facts, the minister and the Prime Minister put two flawed arguments to bolster their claim. The first is that employment is increasing. When they have to explain these unfavourable studies, the second reason they give is that they have not taken into account the benefits of the social wage. I want to take up each of those points individually. Of the jobs created by the Labor government since it came into power, the majority have been part-time jobs, not full-time jobs. Full-time employment has increased by 14 per cent, while part-time employment has risen by a massive 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the outcome, we see that, while it has lifted some incomes marginally, it is not the same as getting people into real employment. The white paper measures will only exacerbate this situation. Until the economy is restructured to create a significant number of full-time jobs, the current situation will persist. In relation to the growth in employment, it is largely a factor of population growth. It is not a factor of anything the government has particularly achieved. That is spelt out in the statistics that the Prime Minister gave us today when he reminded us all that unemployment is still at over nine per cent at a time when we are supposed to be coming out of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has often stated that it has increased the social wage. I concede that there have been a number of benefits, which we have talked about, of marginal extension to family incomes. The home child-care allowance cashed out the dependent spouse rebate but provided little additional funds. But what the government fails to comprehend is that the social wage should always be the second best option after increasing employment prospects. The effects of social wage increases have been nullified. They have been effectively nullified by industrial relations constraints and the tax inefficiencies introduced by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this are sad but simple. The costs of employing people are rising. We are not saving enough. We are not investing enough. The net effect is that the government is not creating enough employment to erode long-term unemployment in this country. It is not a question of saying, `You have not taken the social wage into account. We found some way of bandaging up the problem.' It is a question of how you can address the fundamental problems facing Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest problem I had in preparing for this address today was the number of available studies and the choice among the mass of information that reveals what is happening today. The situation is clear: this government, notwithstanding all of its rhetoric or all it has said over decades, has created a situation in which the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. The only difference is that the government ministers are trying to join the rich. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a contribution from the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) on this important subject which, quite frankly, was factually wrong in almost every conceivable respect. I will turn to that in a minute. We heard the misquotation and systematic misinterpretation of papers and studies. In some cases the honourable member portrayed a picture which is the diametrical opposite of reality. That is not surprising given that the contribution of the opposition on social policy was described by Laurie Oakes, I think, as `a characteristically lightweight effort'. I can only concur with that. I notice that the member for Berowra, seeking a definition of the `welfare state', turned to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penguin Dictionary of Politics</EMPHASIS>. I suppose it is unfortunate that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Penguin Dictionary of Politics</EMPHASIS> did not contain a definition of `policy'. Maybe that would have been of some value.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to contest the central claims of the opposition. I guess the starting point is that we have to acknowledge that during the 1980s, throughout the developed world, forces were operating which have tended to drive earnings differentials wider. That is the case, but you cannot just look at it from that point of view. The factors that led to that have been the subject of quite a bit of discussion and analysis. People talk about the impact of the globalisation. In effect, low paid workers in industrialised countries are increasingly in competition with workers in developing countries. Then there is the impact of technological change in the nature of work, and that has both an upskilling and deskilling effect, again tending to widen earning differentials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if you look at the raw information on earnings, there is some widening in this country. But that is a feature, as I said, of most developed countries, particularly countries in the Anglo-Saxon world. A number of those changes I referred to&mdash;the globalisation, technological change, the changing nature of work&mdash;obviously have very positive effects in a good many respects. But this tendency to widen earning differentials is obviously a negative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant issue from the point of view of government is what is the impact of government policy on those things and to what extent has government policy either exacerbated or diminished those underlying trends of inequality? If you look at our effort in that area, there is no doubt that government policy has tended to diminish and, quite possibly, to have negated those underlying forces, producing increases in earning differentials. There have been a number of studies done which have made it very clear that the impact of our tax and social security transfer payments system has been to very significantly mitigate inequality. There is no doubt about that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government came to office, there have been enormous improvements in the quality of the social security safety net&mdash;increases in targeted payments to low income families between 50 per cent and 100 per cent in real terms, real increases in pensions, very substantial increases in rental assistance, and increases in benefits paid to people who are unemployed. Across the board, there have been improvements in those areas in real terms and measured against any of the poverty lines currently in use, particularly the Henderson poverty line. The Henderson poverty line is a flawed construction. I will talk about that a bit later on. Whichever poverty line you care to choose, things have improved markedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very sharp contrast with the performance of the opposition. Key benefits fell in real terms during the Fraser years. The result during our tenure has been the diametrical opposite. The government has acted to promote employment growth&mdash;26 per cent, over two million&mdash;since this party came to office. Contrast that with the situation in New Zealand during the 1980s where the economy and employment growth were virtually stagnant for long periods of time and only in the relatively recent period have we seen reasonable employment growth in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, employment growth in Australia in the five years or so towards the end of the 1980s was the most rapid in the OECD world. As a result of the recovery we are now experiencing, we have seen extraordinarily fast employment growth over the last few months. That, obviously, has a major bearing on living standards, inequality and levels of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that we have achieved this growth in employment in the context of an industrial relations framework designed to ensure equity in the distribution of the benefits of recovery. That, again, is in sharp contrast with the policies of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things which is very clear from studies of inequality throughout the developed world is that in those countries where we have seen wholesale labour market deregulation and the stripping away of any semblance of a safety net the trend is consistently strongest towards greater inequality. That is the case, for example, in Great Britain where the so-called genie coefficient, which is a measure of inequality, is shown quite unambiguously. That country has experienced the worst growth in inequality in the developed world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, there is a very strong correlation between those unusually rapid deteriorations in terms of inequality and deregulated labour markets. The coalition would go along with a wholesale deregulation of the labour market. That is a central element of its policy. There is no reason, therefore, to suppose that things would not deteriorate very severely under its tenure. Where are the major cuts in the social wage, of the order of $10 billion or so, which the coalition has committed to, going to impact? They will inevitably be on low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the whole set of proposals on families policy that we have seen float from the opposition, we see that the one thing the proposals have in common is their extreme regressivity&mdash;whether you are talking about income splitting, as proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), or about taking all the assistance for families and dividing it up per head, as suggested by Senator Minchin. There are a variety of proposals coming from the opposition. All of them would make the situation of those on lowest incomes worse. The opposition can say what it likes about this government's achievements&mdash;they have been considerable in improving the quality of the safety net&mdash;but the fact is that there is no ambiguity that coalition policies would severely worsen the prospects of people on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition spokesperson talked about a number of studies which he claims support the coalition's position. What I and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have said consistently is that in considering these questions you have to look at a comprehensive measure of people's material wellbeing. It is not enough to look at money incomes. That is not disputed by any serious social researcher who has considered these matters. This is particularly so in a situation where over the 1980s there has been an explicit trade-off between the growth in money wages and social wage expenditures. That has been a central feature of the accord framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various elements that bear on living standards have to be factored in. For example, if health and housing are taken out of the picture the level of inequality is increased by a factor of about 20 per cent. It is obviously the case that in considering this government's record we have to take into account the introduction of Medicare, the spread of child care, all the measures to improve the social security safety net, all the improvements in the housing assistance and so forth. All these things have to be factored in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of attempts to adopt a more comprehensive approach to looking at these matters. In question time the other day I referred to the study by Peter Travers and Sue Richardson, which was set out in a recent book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living decently: material well-being in Australia</EMPHASIS>, published by Oxford University Press last year. In this particular study the researchers have gone out of their way to look at all the determinants of material wellbeing: access to services, the social wage, levels of home ownership, ability to make use of assets&mdash;as well as conventional cash incomes. I quote them again because I think it is very telling:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our chief conclusion is that at the end of the 1980s most Australians were indeed `living decently'. Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was not the world-leader in equality, but it still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world. Australia is a world-leader when it comes to social mobility; that is, both privilege and disadvantage are less likely to be inherited in Australia than in any other country. There is disadvantage, of course, but one of our more positive findings is that disadvantage in one aspect of life is often offset by advantages elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA>They then go on to give a number of examples of that. They continue:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our positive picture of high levels of affluence and of relative equality is at variance with the `gloom and doom' that is typical of many editorial writers and political and social commentators. One reason for this is that we use rather more complex measuring-sticks of affluence and of material disadvantage than are common in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the central point: when you take this comprehensive view, the whole picture changes quite markedly. Another important study, released only very recently, was written by Peter Whiteford, the Senior Research Fellow in the Social Policy Research Unit at the University of York. His paper is called `Income distribution and social policy under a reformist government: the Australian experience' and is published in a British journal called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Policy and Politics</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the approach he has adopted has involved an attempt to look comprehensively at all the factors that bear on material wellbeing. I will quote a couple of excerpts from his article, which is a very rigorous analysis that, again, takes this comprehensive approach:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the criticisms of the Australian Government policy in the 1980s, the conclusion of this article is that rather than substantial increases in poverty, falls in living standards, and increases in inequality, living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially.</PARA>
<PARA>He then makes a very stark contrast between that situation in Australia and the situation prevailing in the United Kingdom, governed, of course, by a political party of the same persuasion as that of the opposition. The article continues on that specific matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whatever the caveats that must be attached to these comparisons, it is difficult to accept that the records of these governments are similar.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the UK and Australia. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The UK figures suggest a dramatic widening in income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, important trends have not been incorporated in the microsimulation, and the results are partial. Nevertheless, the analysis is significantly more comprehensive than that of the critics.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, he sums up the thrust of policy in this country by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within the framework of a consensual incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the studies that have adopted this comprehensive approach, which is essential. It is no good just looking at earnings in isolation. Everybody who looks at the issue seriously accepts that. When you take that comprehensive approach, you get a very different picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing the abuse by the opposition of the papers written by Dr Ann Harding. Dr Harding, it is true, is a stringent critic of the Henderson poverty line. This paper by Ann Harding that the opposition referred to does use the Henderson poverty line, which seems a bit strange. If honourable members read the paper by Dr Harding, they will see that she is very clear in saying that it should not be regarded in any sense as a definitive measure of poverty levels.

<PARA>Of course, that does not stop you from using and abusing the statistics as if they were definitive. I reiterate: the government's record since it was elected in 1983 has been one of repairing the tax base to remove inequities&mdash;particularly picking up capital gains, fringe benefits and various other elements that were completely, or effectively, ignored before&mdash;and to systematically act to repair and improve the targeting of the social security safety nets with very substantial real improvements in the levels of payments going to those who are worst off in our society. </PARA>

I find that totally inexplicable. The minister then introduced the smokescreen of the quality of the safety net. Then he said, `Try to excuse the inequality in income in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you should quote it accurately. The Luxembourg income study, which Australia joined in 1978, discloses quite clearly that, in the table ranking inequality, Australia is near the bottom. Of the 10 countries in the study, we are right down the bottom with Germany and the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also quite staggered to hear the minister say&mdash;I am not quoting him exactly but this is the import of what he said&mdash;`You shouldn't consider poverty in terms of money. Income isn't all important.' The 20 per cent of unemployed people in my electorate would disagree with that. The minister said, `Well, of course you've got to consider the areas of health and housing.' I agree with that, sure, but there is a relationship between health and housing and poverty. The fact that you are poor has an adverse impact on you in terms of poverty. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> stated that more than 13,000 homeless people were housed in supported accommodation services. One in four people who rent and one in four people under 24 years of age were living below the poverty line. There is a reference for the ministers to talk about health and housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first international study of single motherhood has found that most single mothers are living in poverty and that children from these families are likely to have a reduced life expectancy. Yes, health is associated with poverty. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 16 September this year states that poverty is a health risk. It stated that Australians living in poor areas have a far greater chance of getting sick and dying young than do more affluent people. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare survey gives a disturbing assessment of health disparities between the rich and poor. Men in poor areas are up to 70 per cent more likely to die early than are those in wealthy suburbs. Women in poorer suburbs are three times more likely to die from diabetes, and men in the same areas have a 72 per cent greater chance of committing suicide or being killed in a traffic accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment is also inextricably linked to poor health, with the death rate for jobless men between 25 and 64 years of age more than 16 per cent above the national average. How can the minister enter this debate and start talking about the relationship between money and poverty, and say, `Oh, well, the health and housing offsets the lack of money'?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He did indeed. The report also said that the avoidable death rate for the unemployed is up to 130 per cent higher. I say to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the people listening to debate: that is totally unacceptable. The minister says, `Oh, well, you don't have to worry about money,' but if you are poor you have poorer housing and you have poorer health. Men on low incomes are six times more likely to suffer mental illness and twice as likely to get ulcers, and women on low incomes have a 50 per cent greater chance of suffering nervous tension and insomnia. So the minister should not tell me that it does not matter if we do not have the money because we have health and housing. All the evidence tells us that the health of people in poverty is far worse than the health of the rest of the community. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to present the House and the people who are listening with some vital figures that demonstrate what has happened over the last 11 years. Wealth is certainly a factor to consider when looking at the rich or the poor. In 1990, one per cent of Australians owned 19.7 per cent of all the wealth. The top 10 per cent owned 52.2 per cent. The top 20 per cent owned 72 per cent of all the wealth in Australia. The top 50.5 per cent owned 98.4 per cent of all wealth in Australia. After 11 years of Labor, the bottom 49.5 per cent own only 1.6 per cent of the wealth. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the distribution of wage income. This excludes the unemployed. If the unemployed are included, the figure becomes far worse. Research by Messrs Rees, Rodley and Stilwell shows that inequality has increased by over 25 per cent in the past 16 years. The share of the bottom 20 per cent of the population was 8.2 per cent in 1975 and down to 5.9 per cent in 1990. The share of the top 20 per cent&mdash;this is of wage income&mdash;was 34.2 per cent in 1975 and up to 37.3 per cent in 1990. Under Labor, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. </PARA>

Earlier this week, when the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) asked a question of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during question time, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over our period of time $6 billion has been transferred in family payments, particularly to low income families and to families on incomes up to the extension of the income test for the family allowance. There has been endless debate in this country about where a poverty line is these days. One thing is for sure&mdash;there would be a lot more people in poverty without two million jobs having been created and without these huge transfers in the budget having taken place, which the coalition is arraigned against.</PARA>
<PARA>I will conclude by referring to Peter Trower and Sue Richardson's 1993 book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Living decently</EMPHASIS>. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. By far the most important form of wealth is the family home: 75-80 per cent of Australians eventually own their own home free of debt and the house represents 55-60 per cent of total household wealth.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. Wealth rises with education (about 10 per cent for each additional year) and age (about 2.5 per cent for each additional year up to age 58).</PARA>
<PARA>This government has done more than any previous government to increase the levels of education. They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, it is safe to conclude that Australia ranks in the top dozen or so countries in the world in terms of equality in the distribution of income. The evidence we have on the distribution of earnings is consistent with this assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is Australia relatively egalitarian in the distribution of income, it is more so now than in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This move toward a more equal distribution applies not only to income but also to wealth . . . Were a more comprehensive measure of income to be used which embraced government-provided services such as health and education, the decrease in inequality over time would be even more pronounced.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present  the ninth and 10th reports of the committee for 1994 relating to the midlife upgrade of Blamey Barracks, Kapooka, New South Wales, and the stage 2 redevelopment of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first report which I have tabled involves the midlife upgrade of Blamey Barracks in Kapooka, New South Wales. The committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated cost of $21.5 million. Most of the buildings at Kapooka were constructed in the 1950s and 1960s and are now in need of refurbishment. Present working and living conditions at the barracks are below standard, with the rank and file and recruit kitchen not meeting building codes or occupational health and safety requirements. A need therefore exists to provide suitable working and living conditions for recruits and staff stationed at the barracks at Kapooka.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While at the barracks at Kapooka, the committee was impressed with the green areas around the base. The committee  compliments the Department of Defence on reticulated treated effluent from the sewerage treatment facilities being used to irrigate these landscaped areas at Kapooka. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearing, concern was expressed that local industry would not be given the opportunity to be involved in the project. The Department of Defence has since held meetings with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and assurances were given that the construction manager for the project will not be tendering for construction works at Kapooka. The committee was advised by the Department of Defence that it intends to conduct a seminar with the building industry in Wagga Wagga to discuss forms of contract and tendering processes. The Department of Defence advised that each package or trade element will be awarded as the result of a competitive tendering process. Local companies should therefore be in a strong position to make competitive bids. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence continue discussions with the building industry in Wagga Wagga and proceed with its intention of conducting a seminar for the building industry in the near future. The committee has commended the Department of Defence on its willingness to liaise with members of the building industry concerning the proposed works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled involves the stage 2 redevelopment of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. The Royal Military College is the premier institution for the training of officers of the Australian Army. It trains men and women in the skills of leadership, tactics, military law and administrative procedures. The proposal examined by the committee involved the provision of modern and functional facilities to support the training objectives of the college, and comprises: a new logistics complex and headquarters building; extensions to the gymnasium, officers' mess, military instruction block and medical centre; the upgrading of playing fields and ovals, along with adjustments to the existing road network to provide safer and more efficient traffic circulation. The committee has recommended that the work should proceed at an estimated out-turn cost of $28.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant element of the proposed works is the construction of a new logistics complex. The committee concluded that the existing complex is housed in inadequate and deficient accommodation and that it should be replaced. Another element is the proposed construction of a new headquarters building. The committee concluded that the proposed location and design of the proposed new headquarters building are consistent with the master plan and should be compatible with adjacent buildings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A feature of the redevelopment which those members who travel to and from Canberra airport&mdash;most of the members of this House&mdash;will notice when the work is completed will be the provision of a new main entrance. This is dictated largely by the ACT government's proposed duplication of Morshead Drive, which was examined by another committee some years ago. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence and the ACT government should discuss coordination of road construction with a view to the work being undertaken concurrently as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with the upgrading of the playing fields, the committee was pleased to discover that the army has a pilot project under way involving the use of grey water to water the playing fields. If the pilot project proves feasible, substantial savings in water and funds will be achieved. The committee has therefore recommended that, if no salinity problems emerge, the use of grey water should be extended to all playing fields at Duntroon and the Australian Defence Force Academy, as well as other defence establishments, where practical. I commend the reports to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I commend the government on this expenditure of $21.5 million for the midlife upgrade of Blamey Barracks, just west of Wagga Wagga. I think it is fitting that it be called Blamey Barracks because, as we know, Field Marshall Sir Thomas Blamey, one of Australia's most famous soldiers, lived much of his early life in and around Wagga Wagga.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if members of the House know that all soldiers in the Australian Army do their first recruit training at the recruit training battalion at Kapooka near Wagga Wagga. It is in that establishment that the foundation of many military careers have been formed and are being formed. More than physical exercise, drill and weapons training are taught there. It is there that those values and virtues that we hold dear in our Defence Force personnel are first formed&mdash;the virtues of self-discipline, respect for themselves and their own ability, respect for other people, and respect for the flag and Australian institutions. Wherever Australian soldiers go, they are highly regarded and highly respected for those virtues of courage and loyalty. With the peacekeeping forces we have had in the past in Cyprus, the Middle East and other places and, more recently, in Somalia and Cambodia, the initial virtues which are instilled in soldiers in Kapooka have come to the fore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that members of this House are always impressed with the calibre of Australia's youth, particularly those who have a desire to serve in our defence forces. From speaking to Lieutenant Colonel David Kibbey, the commandant at Kapooka, I found that he holds those views even more strongly than I do. He is absolutely amazed at the calibre of our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expenditure on the mid-life upgrade is important, because it is important for our soldiers' morale that they know they are serving in a modern and high-tech force. This is in tune with the national training agenda of the federal government, which I think is also very important. It is no good coming from a school which may have computers into a Defence Force training establishment which just has chalk and a blackboard. So I regard this expenditure as being of the utmost importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The alterations and additions are necessary also because, as the chairman of the committee, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, the main buildings were constructed in 1965-66. So the making of these alterations are long overdue, particularly in view of the anti-discrimination laws that have come in. These alterations reflect the change in social climate that has occurred over the last 30 years, particularly in the training of young women along with the men in our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carrying out of these alterations will mean millions of dollars of disposable income for Wagga; the money will be spent there. The army already spends millions of dollars in Wagga, it employs 75 civilians in the area and, of course, graduations are often held there&mdash;I think almost once a week when the Kapooka barracks are working at maximum levels. Of course, families come to Wagga to watch the graduation ceremonies and they spend a lot of money there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also sincerely thank the chairman and members of the committee for coming to Wagga and listening to the concerns of the army. I thank them also for listening to the concerns of those local contractors who in the past have felt left out of being able to put in tenders for some of the contracts, both big and small. Now that their fears have been allayed, they will be able to submit tenders&mdash;and I think that is a good thing. I congratulate the committee on this report. I thank the committee for coming to Wagga and look forward now to the building and upgrading of the Blamey barracks, which I am sure will well serve not only our defence forces at Kapooka but also the Australian nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2) amends legislation in three main areas: it brings the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Industrial Relations Commission; it brings in minor changes to senators' and members' allowances; and it alters voting and quorum arrangements within the National Health and Safety Commission. I will look mainly at the changes to the present Coal Industry Tribunal and the handling of the matter by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). The minister's handling of the matter is cause for concern. This bill represents the ethos of the Labor Party, of course, but also of concern is the very practical matter of the minister's workload being within his capacity or capabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the public record now that the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations, on behalf of the government, have backed down from the original proposals to abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal. The tribunal will become a separate part of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The minister cannot seem to make up his mind. He has had some difficulties, as we all know, with the air safety issue; and with ANL&mdash;worthless one day; valuable the next. The minister has demonstrated over the past month that he has been stretched beyond his limit. His current portfolios are too much for him to cope with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the record of the government on the Coal Industry Tribunal, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> on Tuesday, 19 April the Minister for Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that it's been very ineffective in recent times in stopping this type of industrial dispute . . . This is the third of this type of industrial dispute in the coal industry we've had since September of last year. And I think they've been very difficult to stop. </PARA>
<PARA>On 19 April 1994 Monica Attard, in an interview with the Minister for Industrial Relations, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has announced it will abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal as coal workers across the country strike.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Industrial Relations said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me say today that I believe and the Government believes that the decision of the Mineworkers' Union to take industrial action each time they're dissatisfied with the outcome of coal price negotiations, is a totally unsatisfactory state of affairs. It's doing great damage to this industry, and from the Government's point of view it is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it's high time that, given the contempt that the union has consistently shown for the decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, that we should bring the coal industry into the mainstream of industrial relations and bring it under the auspices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>As has been said, the Coal Industry Tribunal has long been unable to stop industrial action. As we have just heard, the government has acknowledged that on occasions the tribunal is a toothless tiger. Indeed, at the time of the decision to abolish the tribunal, coal workers were on strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the connection between the government and the union. It is part of Australia's history, and we are all aware of it. Let me quote the words of John Maitland when he talked about Minister Brereton and the President of the ACTU, Martin Ferguson. The Central Council of the United Mineworkers Federation gave Maitland the power to call an indefinite coal strike around 12 October 1994. Maitland tells reporters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laurie appears to be the type of person that likes to engage in a bit of brinkmanship. I am now in a position to be able to engage in that same sort of brinkmanship.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the way the Labor Party does business. The minister sounded very brave back in April, but when the heat really came on in October the minister and the government folded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision that the Australian people have to make is whether this government is governing in the national interest and whether this government is for all the people. I do not think most Australians have to be Rhodes scholars to make up their minds about that. What the government constantly tells us is that this is only about a safety net. It is only about social justice. It is only about being fair. Fair to whom? Is it fair to militant minorities? Is it fair to those that make the loudest noise? Is it fair to the government's mates? Or is it fair to the majority of Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the opposition's point of view, we have long said that it was absurd to have the Coal Industry Tribunal and the Industrial Relations Commission. To have separate tribunals to cover separate industries is an outdated system. However, as I said, the government backed down from the original plan to abolish the tribunal. Why? It backed down to the Maritime Union. The minister capitulated to pressure from the United Mineworkers Federation, and now we find the Coal Industry Tribunal is going to be an attachment to the IRC. From next year, we are told the Coal Industry Tribunal will become an industry panel within the IRC. The IRC will have to take into account precedents set by the tribunal's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any evidence that bringing the Coal Industry Tribunal under the umbrella of the IRC will make unionists listen to it? Why should they change? Why should we continue to have a tribunal, albeit in a different form which for many years has not worked? As I indicated earlier, on 19 April the minister was waxing lyrical about what he was going to do with this tribunal. He said that he hoped `all Australians would support the idea of an industrial umpire that covers all industry'. Clearly, the pressure got too much. He went on to say that he thought it was `entirely reasonable in these circumstances that the commission responsible for almost every other area of IR in Australia should have an overview of the coal industry'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, on 11 October the minister said on radio that it was `absolutely appropriate and entirely sound to see the coal industry brought into the mainstream of Australian industrial relations'. Why then did he change his mind? Why later on did the minister decide to retain the tribunal as a panel within the IRC? I just have to keep coming back to it&mdash;it is everything to do with the union pressure and the union threats. The threat of that indefinite national strike&mdash;the Australian National Line strike was typical of that as well&mdash;was able to buckle the government. It was just the threat in the case of the coalminers. The Seamen's Union actually had to strike. With these threats, the unions then talk to the government. That is the crux of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CFMEU's argument is that the coal industry workers operate in a hostile and unnatural environment. After the Moura disaster, no-one is going to dispute that coalmining is a demanding and in many cases&mdash;I hope less and less cases&mdash;dangerous business. Safety is of paramount concern. But that is not the issue for this tribunal. The issue for the tribunal is about wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody is going to deny coal workers the opportunity to earn a decent wage&mdash;in fact, top wages&mdash;because they earn it. They should be paid well, but it is much more to do with the ability to twist the government's arm. No-one is going to deny them. There are millions of workers in this country who are able to negotiate arrangements, but they do not need a separate tribunal. As the minister said, it is time they came in under the same tribunal as everybody else. I will just go to some of the issues about unionism. Unionism, sadly, is about dependence, not independence. </PARA>

We on this side say good luck to them because we are not jealous. Let us not have this hypocrisy and double standards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to talk about egalitarianism and equity in this country, we should look to regional Australia. When we look through the 147 electorates we find the electorates with the lower incomes. This government has failed to address the situation of regional Australian electorates getting poorer. By international standards we do enjoy a very reasonable standard of living. But it is not about how much most of us have to provide for ourselves. It is really about equity. It is about the egalitarianism of our nation. The Labor Party has to come to terms with, and has to be able to explain in the clearest possible way, how it has become the party of the rich at the same time as it purports to be the party of the poor. Regional Australia is very much a part of those lower income areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue the government continues to ignore is that of regional Australia and the reason there are lower incomes in those areas. It is simply its policies&mdash;particularly in the indirect tax and fuel excise areas, and also in the matter of industrial relations. When the Industry Commission brought forward its reports all it talked about was more flexibility in the industrial relations area. All it wanted was a little more flexibility because the cost of living was different in regional and metropolitan areas. It said that regional areas may be advantaged if more flexibility could be allowed within the award system. It is pretty straightforward commonsense, honest sort of stuff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. Only the names of the individuals concerned have been deleted to protect the innocent, as the saying goes. I want to talk about a worker who earns about $40,000 a year. This person is in a contributing superannuation scheme administered by a large life company. As the table shows, over the 12 months to the year ended 30 June 1994 the worker and employer paid $3,040.47 into the individual's superannuation account. Accumulated funds in the account amounted to $5,682.18 at the beginning of the financial year, 1 July 1993. So over the year income was earned on an amount of up to $9,722.65&mdash;a modest sum, I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker. But that is beside the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest on investment income credited was a princely sum of $368.18, or 5.25 per cent. Not bad, we might say. These days, a return of up to 5.25 per cent is pretty good. But that is far from the total picture. Labor's laws allow and even stipulate that charges and taxes are docked from accumulated funds. What are the charges in this case? They are for administration fees, insurance fees and&mdash;wait for it&mdash;Labor's up-front contributing tax on the fund's earnings. In this case, the first two mentioned imposts&mdash;the fees&mdash;totalled $112.19. Labor's grasping tax grab was $277.31. There you have it. Interest earned was $368.18, and fees and taxation totalled $407.10. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You would think at first glance that fees and tax exceeded income for the year and you would be dead right&mdash;right to the tune of $38.92. More importantly, you might start to wonder how on earth this fund is going to provide for the retirement of the superannuant. If taxes and charges outstrip the earnings of an established superannuation scheme, you would have to say in all honesty that all that could be expected is that the weight of contributions will be just enough to get a person means tested out of all or part of the age pension on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of crazy system is it when Labor's contribution tax is by far the main factor in driving down the superannuation benefits of an employee who is doing more than the government insists upon in providing for his retirement? Only a decade ago, 14 per cent of income put aside over the working life of an individual was enough to secure a livable income on retirement. Now, under Labor, it is 18 per cent and rising, largely because of Labor's legislated imposts and, in particular, the contribution tax. That, I suppose, is progress under Labor. But it also gives lie to the nonsense the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was going on with today in question time when he was trying to substantiate and justify a system which is plainly failing. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I have asked whether he or a representative would visit the affected areas to inspect the damage. I have also asked the government to consider providing assistance to those who have been afflicted as a result of the bushfires.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I will mention one of the volunteers, Clive Gauldie, who was responsible for saving the life of one of his colleagues, Neil Dingwall, who had joined the fire brigade less than 24 hours earlier. According to a local newspaper article, a Palmwoods volunteer firefighter was running for his life through a fireball on Tuesday when he stopped to take a burning colleague by the hand and lead him from the inferno. That firefighter was Clive Gauldie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During times of war and civil tragedy we find great bravery. The fact that Neil Dingwall's life was saved is a great tribute to the bravery of Clive Gauldie and others who risk their lives in their jobs. It should be recognised that more services need to be provided to rural brigades to enable them to fight bushfires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to respond to the comments that were made by the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) in relation to the sad death of Michael Vanstone, who was a friend of his and a friend of mine. At one time in his career Michael Vanstone was a research officer with the committee office in the parliament. I understand from staff here that he was very highly regarded and a free spirit. The last comment that was made to me is one that I can certainly endorse. He was a very decent man and his passing is of great sadness to all of those who knew him and knew of him.</PARA></TALK.START>

The editor of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> is Christopher Pearson, who is also a friend of mine. I understand that Michael Vanstone, on his deathbed, actually sought an assurance from Christopher Pearson that he would do everything in his power to ensure that the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS>, much beloved by Michael Vanstone, would not be allowed to die. Christopher Pearson, as I understand it, gave him that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the situation in Adelaide is that the Murdoch press has chosen to launch a monthly arts publication quite specifically&mdash;I do not think this could be denied&mdash;targeted at removing the one tiny piece of print competition it has in Adelaide. To recap what the member for Warringah said, in Adelaide the Murdoch press owns the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> daily and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> distributed on Saturday, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS>. It owns the only non-free weekly publication and it owns all of the publications which are known as the suburban free weeklies. So in Adelaide there is almost a monopoly. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> is the only piece of print journalism that is available. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> has chosen to launch a monthly arts magazine, which will be, as we understand it, an insert to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. For 200,000 copies, advertisers will only have to pay 1.2 times the rate charged by the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS>. Any student studying the trade practices laws of this country could see that this is an effective and targeted effort to deny the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> advertising revenue and thus drive it out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Murdoch press-News Ltd management should think long and hard about this strategy. I do not think it is a strategy which will serve its corporate interests nationally. Many people will be extremely unhappy about its attempt to drive the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> out of business. I agree with comments that were made by the member for Warringah. Normally competition is a good thing; if one can do better then so be it. However, in the area of the media I think a very different set of principles needs to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to delay the House any further, but I simply caution Murdoch press-News Ltd to think long and hard about this strategy.

I hope that will not happen and I am confident that the people who have supported the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review</EMPHASIS> in the past will show loyalty to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 is a very important bill because it covers a wide range of issues on where government enterprises are going. This bill is particularly about Australia Post, but it can be connected with a lot of other government enterprises that are looking at privatisation, deregulation, corporatisation&mdash;call it what you will&mdash;and how we balance the various interests and opinions in that. It is worth looking firstly at the performance of Australia Post over recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation's 1992-93 annual report confirmed that Australia Post has come a long way in productivity and efficiency: labour productivity in that year increased a record 5.1 per cent and there was a record low level of time lost per full-time employee due to industrial disputation. More than 92 per cent of letters were delivered on time. Australia Post also achieved a $249.4 million profit, which was a record. The return on assets was 14.8 per cent, after including the community service obligations, and there was a $62 million dividend to the government. I think this shows that Australia Post has come a long way in becoming efficient and in delivering a very good service to all Australians. This bill is about where Australia Post goes in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is a conflict in the obligations of Australia Post. On the one hand, the act requires that Australia Post operate commercially to give a profit to the government and be efficient. On the other hand, Australia Post is required to deliver service obligations, so-called community service obligations, some of which, by definition, are unprofitable. That provides a conflict for the management of Australia Post as to where it puts the balance. I think it is worth looking at the issues of where the public interest lies and how we get to what the public interest is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic community service obligation of Australia Post at present is to provide a uniform letter service at a uniform rate on an equitable basis for Australians. Most of the public would not view that community service obligation as that narrow. It is worth noting that that community service requirement in the act is interpreted by Australia Post management, and it is interpreted by various standards that Australia Post applies to its business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its delivery standards say: first business day delivery within metropolitan areas of capital cities or within the same cities or town environments; second business day delivery between a metropolitan area and country locations within the same state; second business day delivery between country areas of the same state; second day delivery between metropolitan areas of different capital cities; third business day delivery between metropolitan areas of capital cities and country locations in other states; and fourth business day delivery between country areas in different states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In deciding that delivery frequency, Australia Post also arrived at a series of cost scales that are based on the amount that it costs to deliver a letter to a metropolitan delivery point. The method of costing that is based on what is called the urban base rate, which is currently $93 per annum. As defined by Australia Post, the cost delivery scales for roadside delivery are as follows. If the cost is up two UBRs, urban based rates, people get five deliveries per week; between two and three, they get three deliveries per week; between three and eight, two per week; between eight and 13, one per week. That is the definition of how the community service obligation of a standard letter service is interpreted by Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing on with that, it is noticeable that, at the bottom end of the scale in remote country areas, the cost is greater and the return is probably unprofitable in some areas. It is certainly unprofitable in many areas. The pressure on the management of Australia Post is to balance that with the community service obligation. As I see it, there is continuing pressure on community service obligations. That is reflected in the Hilmer report, where Professor Hilmer says that if governments choose to restrict consumer ability to choose among rival suppliers&mdash;in other words, if we choose not to implement deregulation continually, or to a great extent&mdash;it should be demonstrated why this is necessary from the public interest point of view. Hilmer put a bias against the public interest in that case because he said that it must be demonstrated to be in the public interest. Dealing with Australia Post and community service obligations, I would rather say that it should be demonstrated that it is in the public interest to deregulate rather than the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the CSOs, the community service obligations, I noticed an amendment which, in part, goes to the focus of CSOs. The amendment is about an additional service for the eight to 13 urban based rates&mdash;the multiple rate to 13&mdash;which receive one per week. I have had a look at the speeches of previous opposition members. The amendment really does not deal with the issues of substance. The issues of substance are as follows: how much pressure is put on Australia Post to return dividends; and how much deregulation is allowed into Australia Post, which again puts pressure on its profit performance and its ability to deliver CSOs. There is also the question of the right way to fund CSOs&mdash;whether through the cross-subsidy, as occurs at present, or whether, as suggested by Hilmer and I think the IC report, by a separate budgetary item. Another issue is the methodology used in costing those community service obligations. All those issues are going to affect the extent and the breadth of how CSOs are delivered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are very important points that the government must consider as we progress towards the economic point of view that deregulation, almost in all circumstances, is a good thing and in the public interest. Hilmer seems to put forward the idea in his report that the public interest is equivalent to economic efficiency goals. I dispute that in some cases, particularly for rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question to be answered is: how do we cost CSOs? The present method of costing is by the long-term avoidable cost, because that is the allowance the government makes in determining what the profit performance of Australia Post should be. If the costing of the CSOs is low, the allowance made to the profit performance of Australia Post is then smaller than it should be. The long-term avoidable cost is the saving that can be made at the margin if the service is not provided. Using that prescribed methodology, the cost of CSOs in 1992-93 was $46 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are more realistic ways of costing CSOs. The present costing meets the needs or criteria of economists in the Treasury. It produces results which are not realistic in ordinary commercial terms. A more appropriate way of measuring the real CSOs of Australia Post would be to estimate the cash cost of the benefits provided by virtue of government ownership to various groups in the community on a non-commercial basis. If an assessment of the CSOs were made on that alternative basis for 1992-93, it would indicate the following estimated costs: retail network losses for non-reserved services necessarily incurred to provide universal access to postal facilities, $30 million; reserved services cross-subsidy, $122 million; registered publication losses, $11 million; and heritage property costs, which are not included at all, $20 million. That would give a total of $183 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post is allowed by the government around $50 million. It is fairly obvious that Australia Post would acknowledge a more realistic cost of $183 million, and it is not getting allowance for that. It would be a natural reaction for Australia Post management to try to push down its CSO costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from that, there are other issues that are affecting Australia Post in providing CSOs, sometimes in a more implicit way. Australia Post needs to earn a commercial rate of return on its assets. It needs to maintain the extent of the Commonwealth's equity in Australia Post and the expectation of the Commonwealth that Australia Post will return a dividend. It needs to maintain Australia Post's financial viability and it needs to consider the cost of the CSOs, which I have just mentioned, and other commercial matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Australia Post is now required to make capital repayments to the Commonwealth. Those payments make Australia Post borrow to a level that is seen as a normal debt to equity ratio of a commercial enterprise. Last year $200 million was requested as a first-off capital repayment. There are opinions that that should be increased until the debt to equity ratio reaches a ratio of one to two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under those pressures, and in light of the IC report and the Hilmer report, it is quite clear to me that the conflict between the need to return a profit and the obligation to deliver the CSOs is biased in favour of returning that commercial profit. That situation will continue to exist. It will be exacerbated by further deregulation of Australia Post. I support this bill because I believe the deregulation contained in it does not upset the balance between the deliveries of the CSOs and the ability of Australia Post to act commercially and efficiently. In fact, I believe it will increase that ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already spoken about some of the substantive issues in terms of the opposition's proposed amendments. The opposition has taken an extremely narrow view of this. It has said, `Let's have two deliveries per week in those areas that are currently only getting one per week.' What about people who are now receiving two per week? Should they get three? What about those who are now getting two to three? Should they get four? What about those who are getting up to two? Should they get more? Should the idea of CSOs be broadened to include other services that are not now included in the requirements for CSOs? They are the questions that need to be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people in remote and isolated Australia have great difficulty receiving mail services on a regular basis. What about them? Their situation needs attention too. It has to start with how CSOs are delivered and funded&mdash;for example, whether they are funded by a cross-subsidy or by a separate budgetary item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way to fund CSOs in order to maintain or increase them is through cross-subsidy. If they were made a separate budgetary item there would continually be pressure to reduce them. The problem of the methodology of costing would also come in. Should the budgetary item be $50 million, in the way that CSOs are costed now, or should it be the real cost, which is $183 million? Treasury would not agree to that. If it were a separate budgetary item at $50 million, we would not get the delivery of the current service, because it costs more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition needs to answer some questions on this issue for the public good. For example, what is its intention with Australia Post? The other day the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) said that he will boost infrastructure development&mdash;and I applaud that&mdash;with money raised through privatisation. It is my view that a full privatisation of Australia Post would result in CSOs having to be funded through a separate budgetary item, which would mean that we would not get the delivery of CSOs as they are now. Further, the government has instituted a method by which public and parliamentary input can be made to the way in which CSOs are interpreted. As I have said in the past, the standards at the present time are set by Australia Post management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next year there will be a public inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. We have decided that that will be done each term, and it will be about what the public expects from the delivery of CSOs. Its findings will be reported to the government and the government will then need to respond to that report. The committee, of course, is a cross-parliamentary committee, and I am sure the rural members of the opposition will be very interested in it. It is absolutely essential that interested rural people give evidence to it and make well heard their point of view about what they see as the community service obligation of Australia Post, which is not what is presently there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Hilmer and the Industry Commission reports, and economic thought generally, have pushed the bias in these issues away from the public interest and towards purely economic interests. We need to bring that back a little. If we can do that through the House of Representatives committee&mdash;which will give the people of Australia and the members of parliament an ability to have an input into what these standards are&mdash;we will see a far better interpretation of what the act says about CSOs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I applaud Australia Post and the workers of Australia Post for the way they have gone about their business in the last few years and increased their efficiency and standards of delivery greatly. I call again on future speakers for the opposition to state exactly whether their policy is to fully privatise or to fully regulate Australia Post. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to participate in this debate and to have the opportunity to follow my friend the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) in his deliberations on the Australia Postal Corporation Amendment Bill. I hope the member for Page was appropriately touched by the crowded opposition benches that his speech in the Main Committee produced. I have to say that I am less than flattered by discovering, now that an opposition member rises to speak, that the benches have decidedly emptied out. It looks as though the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) is about to add further to that general exodus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do want to pick up a point that the member for Page made in his closing remarks when expressing some concern about the rush to privatisation, for want of a better word, that had followed both the IC report and the Hilmer report. He said that he thought it would be a responsible thing to bring that rush to privatisation back a little. My reassurance for the member for Page is that, frankly, what he has just said means that he ought to be supporting the opposition amendment, because that is just what the opposition amendment will do. It says, `Let's ensure that the community service obligations are enhanced and the community made even more aware of them.' All that the amendment foreshadowed by the member for Grey will seek to do is to ensure that Australia Post recognises the community service obligations it has, particularly to people in rural and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the member for Page on a very constructive and considered speech about the legislation currently before the Main Committee. I have been following this debate and I have been a little distressed that some members of the government seemed to get very indignant at what was, in fact, nothing more than a constructive move by the opposition to reinforce the community service obligations. I followed with particular interest the speech by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay), who, in his usual way, attacked the opposition for what we were proposing to do by way of these amendments. The member for Watson was very proud, not only of Australia Post, but of the former PMG&mdash;with which I understand he had had an association during his working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post has a great deal to be proud of. The changes that have occurred in Australia Post are changes that Australians have generally refused to recognise. The Australia Post we have today is a very different organisation from the old PMG. The changes that have occurred to Australia Post are changes of which we should all be proud. What Australia Post has done has been to adopt the political philosophy of the opposition. It has simply said, `Let us become more capitalist and less socialist.' The change in Australia Post has been a move from a socialised PMG, which was a government department through and through, to an Australia Post with a real sense of competition and a real sense of desire to offer service to the Australian community because there are other people also offering a similar competitive service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post ought to laud proudly the fact that it has picked up the philosophy I believe in&mdash;`Let us be exposed to competition and let us be prepared to work within the marketplace, hopefully profitably.' What has Australia Post done? As a result of getting a little more capitalist, it has turned a perpetual loss situation into a profit situation. Although this is not frequently recognised by the post office using community, Australia Post has not only turned a loss situation into a profit situation but it has also offered a return on the investment that the government has in Australia Post. The government is to be commended. Its decision to turn Australia Post into a GBE has resulted in a success story, because in developing Australia Post it has picked up the fundamental philosophy of the opposition and injected it into the old PMG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the Australia Post story? It is a remarkable story, the story of an organisation that every year handles 4.2 billion articles of mail. Last year on its busiest day, 17 December 1993, it handled 44 million articles of mail. As the honourable member for Page has said, it delivered 42 per cent of those articles on time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Page for his interjection. This is an organisation that delivered 92 per cent of those articles on time. It has had a five per cent rise in productivity and it has maintained this service at a basic rate of 45c, which has not changed since 1992. In spite of that basic rate, Australia Post has continued to improve the profitability that it has offered in balance sheet terms and the return on investment that it has offered its principal shareholder, the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the postal rate that existed in 1975 been allowed to keep up with inflation, a basic postage stamp in Australia would now be valued at 69c, not 45c. The 45c stamp represents a real fall in terms of the revenue generated by Australia Post from what it would have been if pegged to the inflation rate of which the present government tells us it is so proud. Let us compare our 45c stamp rate with those across the globe. Expressed in Australian currency, the present rate in the UK is 54c; in Japan, 87c; and in Germany, 88c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post has much of which to be proud, all of which has occurred since it was, for want of a better word, corporatised. It is fair to say that one could look around the globe and say, `Well, if Mr Andrew feels so proud of Australia Post, what about the New Zealand postal rate?' In Australian currency terms, I am told, the New Zealand rate is only 36c. I dare say that, if I said to Australia Post, `All you have to do is service Victoria and Tasmania', it too would be quite happy about pruning something off its 45c. The whole question of a comparison between serving Australia as if it were one place and serving New Zealand is the very point that the honourable member for Page raises with his community service obligations. I want to expand on that in just a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before turning to the CSOs, I will paint a picture of Australia Post as it is in its new, competitive environment, in its capitalist, rather than the former socialist, mode. Frankly, we have an Australia Post which has said, `Let's cease maintaining post offices, even in rural communities where it simply is not justifiable to have a postmaster standing there waiting for a Mr Woods or a Mr Andrew to appear at some time during the day.' Instead it has changed those offices, as all of us in rural seats&mdash;particularly the honourable member for Grey&mdash;are aware, into postal agencies. As a result, the postmaster has been doing a range of things apart from offering the postal service, and the postal service has been much more efficiently delivered. In fact, it was in the delivery of counter services that many of the losses of the original PMG were incurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one MP&mdash;in common with most federal MPs, I suspect&mdash;who has been invited by Australia Post to open the next stage of Australia Post's commercialisation. That is the retail post facility which is being offered at various post offices around rural electorates, allowing the post offices to engage not only in traditional post office business but also in the sale of all sorts of traditional stationery items such as cards, books and pencils. There has been some resistance to this, particularly from those who, for example, run the local newsagencies. It is felt that Australia Post enjoys an unfair advantage over the local newsagency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not have been prepared to be involved in the opening of a retail post facility in my electorate&mdash;and I have been involved in the opening of one in Renmark and one in Waikerie over the last month, and there is one next month at Tanunda&mdash;unless I were first assured that Australia Post was obliged to conduct its business in precisely the same competitive environment as that of any other retailer. It is true to say that Australia Post still enjoys a monopoly on the sale of postage stamps and that, as a general rule&mdash;not as a perfect rule but as a general rule&mdash;in order for any other retailer to get access to the sale of postage stamps, he or she has to pay a licence fee. It is an area that ought to be, and I believe it will be, increasingly challenged by the government as it exposes Australia Post increasingly to the same retail pressure as everyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, my wife tells me that she is much more likely to go into the local newsagent to buy the daily newspaper or the things that she would normally acquire from the newsagent than she is to go, on a daily basis, into the local post office, particularly as our mail is delivered to our residential address. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the interjections do not distract me for too long, I hope to come to that item. I referred to it earlier in my speech. I welcome the changes that are occurring in Australia Post. I pick up much of what has been said by the member for Page in commending Australia Post on its level of efficiency and the profitability that has been shown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to turn to the whole question of CSOs, as I am invited to do by the member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). All that the opposition has done by its amendments is to reinforce the simple fact that there need to be CSOs, because a totally privatised Australia Post&mdash;as with a totally privatised any other government agency&mdash;would fail to deliver, under any party in power, the obligations that it has, either to the disadvantaged in the community if it were a normal government agency, or to rural communities, particularly in the case of Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I echo what the member for Page has said: we do need to balance this rush towards profitability against the community service obligations that we think essential services ought to deliver. It is for that reason that this amendment proposed by the opposition does nothing more than seek to ensure that people in rural communities get two mail service deliveries a week&mdash;not an unreasonable request. It is a reasonable request from the member for Grey which recognises that, particularly in his electorate, there are a large number of rural communities entitled to, not one, but two mail service deliveries a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has not sought to say that everyone should have mail delivered every day, or even that there ought to be more frequent letterbox deliveries, but has simply sought to ensure that those in rural communities are offered, not a remarkable, not an extravagant, but an acceptable service. That is all that this amendment currently does. The IC inquiry in 1991 actually asked that the commission clearly specify and make public the extent of the community service obligations that Australia Post has. We are simply following up that IC request by ensuring that the extent of those community service obligations is clearly understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Leichhardt has asked who is going to pay. The member for Page, I would have thought, had largely answered that question when he indicated that the current estimation of community service obligations was calculated to be something like $46 million. Not unreasonably, he questioned the methodology used to arrive at that $46 million, but at no stage did he suggest that the community service obligations should in any way be further eroded. In fact, reflecting what is the rural nature of his electorate&mdash;and the nature of the member for Leichhardt's electorate is rural too, I hasten to add&mdash;he sought to ensure that those community service obligations would be maintained and that the rush to privatisation that we had seen under the IC and under Hilmer should not suddenly become the sole objective of Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I do not mind what the cost of the CSO is. I think it is not unreasonable to recognise that Australia Post is a government service, just like the Department of Social Security, which is offered to ensure that a particular facility is made available to all Australians. The purpose of the amendment pursued by the opposition is to ensure that the community service obligation is well understood and is not unreasonable. We believe that asking that mail be delivered as frequently as twice a week is not unreasonable in this day and age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post has a proud history. The first post office was established in 1809 in Sydney and in 1901 the PMG, as we then knew it, came into being and existed in that form until 1975 when, as everyone knows, the communication facilities in Australia were split between Telecom and today's Australia Post. In 1989, to the government's credit, Australia Post became a government business enterprise. As I indicated in my opening remarks, its history since then, while chequered, has been largely successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government seeks to do is to ensure that Australia Post not only remains intact, not only remains efficient, not only picks up more capitalist and less socialist tendencies, but in addition to that recognises the community service obligations it has. We are not suggesting that Australia Post should be offering everybody a daily delivery but we make the point that in rural electorates a twice-weekly delivery is not unreasonable, is not an enormous burden to Australia Post and will distinguish Australia Post from other retail outlets. The cost of that is something that ought to be recognised and picked up by the taxpayers across Australia. I am proud to support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Postal Commission Amendment Bill 1994 implements the package of postal industry reform arrangements and further enterprise reforms for Australia Post. It was agreed by the government on 15 November 1993. The amendments are divided into two parts: postal industry arrangements, including Australia Post's obligations, reserve services, powers and obligations; and refinements to accountability and reporting arrangements, including tightening the circumstances where postal information may be disclosed for law enforcement and national security interests. Of course, there are other reforms which have been agreed by the government which have been implemented administratively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I want to make is one that the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) made very well and that has been echoed by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). I totally refute any suggestion that Australia Post and its workers are inefficient and have low productivity. Australia Post's productivity has improved at an average of 2.6 per cent a year since 1975. This is more than twice the average productivity growth of the whole of the Australian economy each year over those 15 years. This represents a steady increase in both revenue generated for each employee and the return on assets. The member for Page talked about the often quoted 5.1 per cent increase in the 1992-93 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there has been a great increase in productivity. An independent survey was taken of Australia Post letter delivery performance over the first three months of 1993 by KPMG Peat Marwick. It came up with the figures that 92.3 per cent of letters carried by Australia Post met or bettered its delivery timetable. Within one more day, the total of letters delivered to their destinations had risen to 98.3 per cent. Almost two-thirds of letters from the country to the capital city of the same state or territory arrived the day after posting. More than 72 per cent of letters from the country to the interstate capitals were a day early. More than 83 per cent of letters sent between country addresses were also a day early. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament should pay tribute to the management of Australia Post and its workers for the efficient organisation that Australia Post is today. The parliament should&mdash;but I suspect the coalition will not&mdash;pay tribute to the Communication Workers Union and its predecessor, the Australian Postal Workers Union, for the part that they have played in achieving these great results by world standards. I notice that the honourable member for Wakefield talked about the efficiency of Australia Post but did not acknowledge, at any time, the input by Australia Post workers and their trade unions. That highlights the difference between this side of the House and the other side of the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I want to concentrate on the delivery of postal services to rural and remote regions in Australia. Obviously, these reforms go together with the review of community service obligations in relation to rural and remote services which Australia Post is currently undertaking. There is also the very important reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure concerning Australia Post's community service obligations to rural and remote areas. This review, which must be completed in the life of the parliament, will enable not only members of this parliament, but also members of the public and organisations, to give evidence before that committee and to have an input into the community service obligations of Australia Post. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the rural task force, established by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), must be acknowledged, and I will also acknowledge the work of my colleague, the honourable member for Page. The Prime Minister's rural task force has already been looking at the RAAS&mdash;by that, I do not mean the rural adjustment scheme; I am referring to the rural air subsidy&mdash;and the task force has visited my electorate of Leichhardt and the electorate of the Northern Territory. The task force spoke to people in my electorate, including a meeting of the Cape York Peninsula Development Association. The National Party did not like it when we came to northern Australia. It has no real answers to the problem with the RAAS. At the time, the Nationals could only offer a scare campaign, saying that the government would abolish the RAAS. That is absolute nonsense. On the contrary, the government is committed to the betterment of Australia Post and Australia Post's community service obligations to rural and remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party does not like it when members of the Labor Party actually represent rural and remote regions. It does not like it at all. The Nationals think that it is their patch and that no-one else should come in, but I have got news for them&mdash;the people in rural and remote Australia recognise that the Labor Party is now the party of country people. The Labor Party is the party that looks after regional Australia and the amendments that are before this committee today illustrate just how out of touch the coalition is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task force found that the major use of RAAS was to deliver mail. I will choose my words very carefully here. RAAS charterers deliver not only letters but also educational matter from the School of Distance Education. They also provide pharmaceutical supplies as well as small parcels. That is all arranged through Australia Post. Australia Post is conducting its current review into its delivery network in remote Australia. It has given consideration to the special education and health needs of remote families, as well as consideration of particular climatic conditions. And, of course, that is very relevant to my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in remote areas do not generally expect more than a weekly mail service. I am not suggesting that we change that. I am not going to give the coalition an opportunity to put around in my electorate some statement that the honourable member for Leichhardt does not support a twice-weekly mail service. That is not true. But if we talk about priorities and we talk to people in rural and remote regions in Australia, they do not jump up and down and say, `We want a twice-weekly mail service.' What they want is a regular, reliable, weekly mail service&mdash;and not just a letter service, I might add. I must emphasise that representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to contribute to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a separate point here. Remote Aboriginal and Islander communities in my electorate and in other parts of northern Australia are developing out-station movements which provide an alcohol-free environment on their traditional lands. This is a very important movement. It has been supported by the government and it has been supported by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs as well as by ATSIC and other Aboriginal organisations. Any rural CSO of Australia Post must include an obligation to provide a regular mail service to Aboriginal out-stations. This will be vital for their future, especially in terms of their educational and health needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome also in the legislation and the complementary administrative arrangements the minister's request to Australia Post to establish audit mechanisms to report annually, and examine how it meets CSO delivery performance standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to return to the coalition's proposals because in my view they should be rejected as not addressing the real problem. According to the Industry Commission, according to a 1992 survey, 156,677 households did not receive a mail delivery at all in Australia. That is 2.4 per cent of all households. That included 124,551 households in rural Australia, 27,236 of them in my state of Queensland. This should be the target of increased community service obligations in rural and remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who spoke to the Prime Minister's task force in my electorate and in the electorate of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) did not press hard for the extension of the services they already had. As I said earlier, they did not say they did not want an extension, that they would not want it. Of course, all Australians would want a daily mail service if they could have it, but that is not what people said to us. They said that they wanted those areas that did not have a mail service to have that mail service and they thought that a weekly mail service was adequate at this stage. </PARA>

I do not want to overestimate this but obviously in an area where Telecom has expanded, certainly in my electorate, to the most remote areas, letters are becoming a little bit out of date. People can use the telephone. It is not that important any more to get a letter from a friend but it is important, as the honourable member for Page emphasises, to get a parcel of educational material once a week. It is important that people get the pharmaceutical supplies that they need if they are in a rural or remote community and cut off in the wet season.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the important emphasis and that is why the coalition is out of touch. That is where we should be looking towards an increase in the CSO&mdash;not at a twice-weekly delivery service to areas that already have mail deliveries. Remember, 2.4 per cent of Australians do not get a mail service at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not deny that in the medium term our goal should be to increase the scope of CSOs. I invite the coalition to put its proposition to the proper parliamentary committee. That is the process that the government has set up. The coalition seems to have grabbed on to the Industry Commission report. It recommends that roadside delivery, which is now once a week, should be increased to at least twice a week. It was stated in that report that in 1992, according to Australia Post&mdash;and this is interesting&mdash;the cost of upgrading to two services a week for those now receiving only one service a week would be at least $3.7 million a year&mdash;or $1,162 a year for each of those 3,000 households. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the doubling of the service would result in a threefold increase in the present cost of providing mail services. This arises because the full cost of providing the extra run would be attributable to the mail since contractors are unlikely to receive any increase in earnings from the carriage of other goods.</PARA>
<PARA>I would say that that would also apply to delivery services under RAAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission seems to be really confused about the differences between the letter service and the mail service. It initially refers to the importance of the mail service to remote communities but then on page 110 it talks about education services being `distributed through the letter service to the outback'. However, the School of Distance Education in Queensland, for example, obviously delivers its materials in large parcels. The Prime Minister's task force saw the evidence in the form of those parcels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what the cost of the Industry Commission's suggestion would be to Australia Post. A twice-weekly letter service would really mean nothing to people. If that were the CSO, it would be no help to people in rural and remote areas because they would be deprived of a parcel service. I am not sure whether the coalition members know what they are talking about in this matter, and I am afraid the Industry Commission is a little mixed up in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that a priority must be given to the mail service. The priority should be to provide a mail service to all Australian households as far as possible. Obviously, there are going to be some exceptions to that, but I think we can reduce that figure of 2.4 per cent of Australians who do not receive a mail service. However, if the guarantee is only a letter service, even if it is twice a week, how does that help people in rural and remote areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the coalition amendments go a little bit further by calling for changes to the definition of organisations and for extended services of document exchange, as I understand it. This would clearly undermine Australia Post. I interjected in the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield by asking how the extended CSOs the coalition is calling for would be paid for. The coalition proposal on document exchange certainly would not pay for them because that would undermine Australia Post by increasing further competition. It would obviously undermine the profitability of Australia Post and its capacity to deliver CSOs, especially to rural and remote areas. Honourable members should remember that the IC said that, even on the basis of a letter service, what the coalition is proposing would cost $3.7 million per year. That is the Industry Commission view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the hidden agenda today? Does the coalition support the recommendation from the Industry Commission that Australia Post should be funded through the budget and not through the current method, which is, quite frankly, cross-subsidisation? I do not mind saying that and those honourable members on this side of the House do not mind talking about or supporting cross-subsidisation. The honourable member for Page talked about the balances that have to be taken into account in relation to that, and I agree with him. Does the coalition support that recommendation? What is its policy on this matter? On the one hand, the amendments that are being moved would diminish the profitability of Australia Post. On the other hand, $3.7 million&mdash;or probably more&mdash;would increase the cost of CSOs. If that is going to come off the budget, where are the deficit daleks now?

Let us make no mistake about this: if further competition is introduced, it will affect the capacity of Australia Post to deliver community service obligations, in particular, to rural remote areas. There is no doubt about that and that will be the net effect of the coalition's amendments. I suspect that the first part about a twice weekly mail service is a bit of a sweetener that the coalition has put in for its own constituency. The real ideological agenda is seen in the other amendments and the effect of those will be the ultimate destruction of Australia Post.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable members who have spoken in this debate. One gets the impression that it has been fairly wide ranging in terms of the approach that has been adopted on the issues. Naturally, honourable members have been concerned about a range of matters to do with postal services relating to all parts of Australia, and that is quite a legitimate and genuine perspective to have. I particularly thank the members of the government who have been part of the discussion process on what is a major step forward in the process relating to the Australian postal services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions before the House are designed to ensure that we carry through the government's response to the Industry Commission report which dealt with a range of issues relating to mail, courier services, parcel services, et cetera. In agreeing to increase competition in the postal sector, the government determined that a phased approach should be adopted. That was designed essentially to do three things. First of all, it was designed to safeguard the basic letter service so that it continues to cost the same to send a standard letter anywhere in Australia&mdash;that is currently 45c. It was also designed to ensure that the benefits of competition are phased in to consumers and business in the form of price restraint, with standard letter prices being subject to a price cap. At the same time, we are encouraging competition in value-added services such as bulk mail, document exchanges and express mail, and working towards the changes recommended in the Hilmer report on national competition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post will remain in government ownership as a statutory corporation operating a national network, but it will face competition in new areas. I can give a commitment on behalf of the government that we are absolutely committed to maintaining Australia Post as a publicly owned government business enterprise. This competition is expected to provide the impetus for Australia Post to continue to improve its services but, at the same time, face competition in the new areas. As part of that process, we are ensuring that new competition comes in, offers the benefits that flow from that, but does not jeopardise services to rural areas or require closure of corporate post offices. There is no broad community support for ending Australia Post's reserved letter service. That is the first point to make in relation to the recommendations of Hilmer. The Industry Commission was unable to identify the costs or benefits from full deregulation of the postal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a phased approach has worked well in the telecommunication sector and we certainly believe that that is the appropriate methodology here. There have been significant decreases in prices across the board in the telecommunication area, and both business and residential customers are benefiting from that. New services are being introduced, service quality has improved and the telecommunications market has grown significantly as a result. Consistent with this approach, the government has determined a similar balanced strategy in relation to the postal sector, with the remaining limits on competition to be reviewed in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks a lot about competition&mdash;although the debate shows that there is a fair amount of inconsistency in the approach that it adopts to these issues&mdash;so it is worth going through what the government's approach means in this area. We have ensured that there has been a significant restructure in the operations of Australia Post, and a number of government members have already referred to that. Australia Post has gone from a public service entity with a poor industrial record to a very efficient and profitable enterprise that operates at the forefront of world best practice and delivery service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly time to build on that constructive base, while setting in place the changes in the regulatory framework to provide competitive disciplines to ensure that services are provided in the most efficient and economic way to Australian businesses and households. That phased approach that I referred to earlier encourages competition in value added services such as bulk mail, document exchange and express mail. At the same time, and importantly, it safeguards the basic letter service so that a standard letter to anywhere in Australia continues to be 45c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also ensuring that the benefits of competition are passed on to consumers and businesses in the form of price restraints, with the standard letter price being subject to that price cap regime. We are working towards the recommendations outlined in the Hilmer report, but we are doing it in a way that matches what is a constructive and timely approach to these issues. For all the chest beating about competition policy, I think Australia Post is an example of how a constructive and deliberative approach to competition can produce efficiencies on the way through, but in a managed way. And I think that is the appropriate thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post will remain in government ownership as a statutory corporation operating a national network. It already has competition in 40 per cent of its revenue. As a result of these decisions, we expect that competition to spread to about 50 per cent of the corporation's revenue. This competition is expected to provide the impetus for continuing improvement in Australian Post services, such as we have witnessed in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduced by the government represents an important part of the reform of the sector. Nevertheless, individual aspects of it have come under scrutiny, and some pressure has been brought to bear in the form of amendments to address the particular concerns of some interests. It is for this reason that the government does not want to amend specific aspects of this package. It has already been the subject of major processes, certainly in terms of the discussions in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant area in which we have accepted an alternative approach is in relation to catalogues and leaflets. The government did not oppose the Democrat amendment to the bill in the Senate as it essentially maintains the status quo under the 1989 act and accords with current practice. It has never been the intention to deregulate advertising mail. The proposed amendments maintain that position, neither liberalising nor clawing back current legitimate activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the provisions of the bill, catalogues and leaflets&mdash;irrespective of whether or not they are directed to a particular person or address, or enclosed&mdash;continue to be exempt from Australia Post's exclusive right to carry letters, given under section 29 of the act. Australia Post will still have reserved to it deliveries of all letters, including generic or pro-forma letters of the kind tabled yesterday by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis). A leaflet or catalogue that is carried with a letter of a kind which is not exempt under any paragraph of section 30 will continue to be reserved to Australia Post, as is the case under current legislation. The amendment will not prevent the enclosure or attachment of a single sheet, fly sheet or an address slip with a catalogue or leaflet the sole purpose of which is to direct the item to a particular person or address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendment which was defeated in the Senate was unacceptable because it would have effectively deregulated this sector, which was never the government's intention. That is the sort of approach the opposition has taken to this proposal. With its amendments on document exchanges and its definition of an `organisation', it effectively wants to dismantle Australia Post's reserve services and to reduce the revenue stream with which Australia Post funds its community service obligations. That is quite the contrary of the sort of thing we heard earlier this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, opposition speakers used New Zealand as an example of effective competition in the postal industry. It is correct that New Zealand reduced price protection from 10 times to two times the standard letter rate in one step. What we did not hear from the opposition was that it resulted in the closure of 600 post offices and a reduction in New Zealand Post's net income from $31 million to 1988-89 to $5.4 million in 1991-92. This is exactly what the opposition's approach to these issues would mean in terms of Australia Post services. I understand that, in June 1993, the New Zealand government announced that the second stage of its postal reform process would not proceed, because there was no proven benefit to be gained from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite ironic that, along with its amendments to deregulate the reserved service, the opposition wants to increase roadside deliveries to two a week. It claims to be doing this in the interest of rural dwellers, and a number of its speakers refer to that. But it is not in the interests of rural dwellers&mdash;far from it. It would have the effect of widening the gap between those receiving minimal services and those receiving none at all. It could even adversely affect the 3,000-odd dwellers currently getting by with one service per week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What would be the approach of those opposite to these issues? Maybe they would adopt the sort of approach that was adopted in New Zealand, where an annual fee of $80 was imposed for rural deliveries. Of course, the problem would be magnified if that approach were adopted here. The amendment could result in the inequitable treatment of households currently receiving fewer than two deliveries per week, in that it proposes no increases for the 125 households which currently have no roadside delivery service available. The proposed amendment also runs the risk of preventing Australia Post from introducing one service per week in places where there are now no services and costs may preclude them from offering two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition members are proposing, through this approach, to substantially reduce the revenue streams which are available to Australia Post with which to provide the postal services which all Australians seek under its community service obligations. This policy, which I am surprised to see members from regional and rural areas support, would ensure that post offices would inevitably close, and postal services would be reduced in rural areas. Far from being a help, it would exactly follow the New Zealand model, and it would have the additional effect of threatening the 45c stamp price frozen by Australia Post until 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has confirmed that the service standards to rural and remote areas will be maintained, and has agreed that a letter service will continue to be made available, at a uniform rate of postage, to all Australians, wherever they reside. The government's approach is to give rural and remote people a say in the postal services they expect. To safeguard rural and remote postal services, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), in conjunction with the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), announced a further step in this regard, which was referred to earlier by a number of speakers. It is the review into Australia Post's community service obligations that is to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review is to be completed once in each parliamentary term. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to contribute to the review. That will provide these communities with an opportunity to have a direct say in their postal services. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, as one who represents a regional area, I am sure you will be pleased that that review will be available and that you will be able to ensure that your constituents from the Hunter, as well as others, are able to actively participate in providing submissions to that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill allows for regulations to be made to prescribed performance standards for such things as mail deliveries. Appropriately, regulations will not be considered until after the completion of the parliamentary review of Australia Post's community service obligations. For the above reasons, I suggest to the House that this is an important reform. It is a balanced strategy which addresses the need for ongoing competition and the need for Australia Post to strive for best-practice standards. I am pleased to say that Australia Post has been achieving those standards in recent times. It has been meeting the challenge of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These additional reform measures will add to the competition that Australia Post faces. At the same time, we are very conscious of wanting to ensure that the capacity exists for parliamentary reviews through the process that the minister has already announced. We also want to ensure that postal services are validly maintained across Australia, with the standard letter rate not being jeopardised by any action that might be taken because of the ill-conceived amendments that have been proposed in the course of this debate. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to rise to support the government's initiatives in the superannuation area. The amendments to the superannuation legislation proposed by this bill, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, further add to this government's commitment to superannuation, particularly in the supervision of superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been quite a bit of discussion lately regarding superannuation and the safeguards that are in place. That is not unusual, of course. Whilst I accept completely the principle that matters for debate before the Main Committee are of a non-controversial nature, and I will certainly do my best to stick to that principle, I know that we do tend to take the opportunity in the debates here to discuss the issues and I think that it is important for us to be able to that. Before I comment, it would be remiss of me not to mention some of the comments from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those members who remained in the House of Representatives after question time on 11 October were treated to shameful scaremongering by the member for Ryan (Mr Moore) when initiating debate on his MPI on superannuation funds. According to him, the government wants to get its hands on the funds in order to pay for lunch. I am quite serious: that is actually what he said. I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and provide a few facts to offset the rhetoric of certain members of the opposition, particularly in that MPI debate. There were some quite outrageous comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was encouraging to see that the opposition supported this bill in the Senate. We have suggested that the opposition do the same here. I hope it will. It would be the best course to take and certainly in the best interests of the supervision of superannuation funds. I am sure there are many members of the opposition who are genuinely concerned about the savings of Australian workers and I commend them for that. They have the opportunity to do something about it today by giving their support to this bill and taking the opportunity to speak in support of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 makes a number of amendments to the Superannuation Industry Superannuation Act 1993 and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. As members would be aware, those acts form the centrepiece of a package of superannuation legislation which gave effect to the new prudential requirements arrangements for superannuation that the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, announced on 21 October 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to amend these acts to further enhance and improve their operation. That is its major and only purpose&mdash;nothing else. There is nothing sinister in the form of compelling superannuation funds to invest in certain areas. I do not have a difficulty with that. I hope that members opposite will bear that in mind when speaking on this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide even stronger protection for the savings of Australian workers in superannuation. This is an issue I have been interested in for many years. Members would no doubt be aware of my previous comments on superannuation legislation. Whilst I do not claim to be an expert in superannuation, my background in the banking industry, particularly in trade union superannuation funds and also as an investment adviser in the banking industry where I had a lot to do with superannuation funds, has given me broad industry experience on how important superannuation funds are for Australian workers. That experience puts me in a more informed position than some of the members opposite who made scaremongering attacks recently, and makes me more informed than the member for Ryan, who made comments in the debate on the matter of public importance that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the member for Ryan was concerned about free lunches. It took a Labor government to put a stop to those, much to the continuing chagrin of the BMW set. Perhaps the member for Ryan was thinking back to the `good old days' where free lunches were the order of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a lot of changes made to superannuation legislation over the past few years. On this side of the House we are aware that these constant changes cause some concern in the community and the business sector. They are essential to ensuring the safety of superannuation funds and the promotion of superannuation for people's retirement. However, the government will not just sit still and do nothing when it sees where improvements must be made. We have to respond to the needs of an ever changing society. These changes apply to a range of issues, and certainly to superannuation. We can be proud of the record that this Labor government has in the superannuation area. General retirement incomes policy has been a real focus of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these changes may create uncertainties, they are implemented to protect the savings of Australian workers and are essential to the safety of superannuation funds. That will always be the primary concern for the government in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of amendments in this bill seek to improve the legislation. Making provision to allow certain non-bank financial institutions to offer approved guarantees required under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act is one of those amendments. Currently only approved banks and the Commonwealth, states or territories can offer the guarantee required under the act. Building societies, credit unions and other financial institutions are subject to the various state financial institutions codes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that these should also be able to offer the guarantees required under the act. If the opposition required proof of the government's commitments to protecting superannuation savings, it need look no further than this amendment. We are placing additional superannuation funds held in these institutions under the strictest superannuation safeguards in the country. When one considers the growing popularity of credit unions and building societies, this amendment should be welcomed. It will give greater protection to significant amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing in-house investments in certain non-bank financial institutions is another example of how the government is giving greater protection to workers' superannuation savings. For the benefit of members unfamiliar with the concept, an in-house investment is simply a loan to an employer sponsor of a superannuation fund. This bill amends the SI(S) Act to place restrictions on the level of these investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment concerns application for the issue of superannuation interest and application to become a standard employee sponsor. As the explanatory memorandum outlines, the bill amends the SI(S) Act to ensure that the trustee cannot accept a person as a member of a public offer entity unless that person has applied in the appropriate manner and has received relevant information determined by the commissioner regarding the entity before doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important aspect of the legislation concerns public offer superannuation funds and equal representation. At the moment, the SI(S) Act requires an employer sponsored fund which is a public offer fund to have an independent trustee. This bill will amend the act to allow such funds to have a greater flexibility in choosing the trustee. It will give them the option of having an independent trustee or having equal numbers of employer and member representatives involved in the trusteeship of the fund. Think about that: actually encouraging members of a superannuation fund, workers themselves for the most part, to play a role in supervising their own money. This provides for funds with greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship while at the same time ensuring that members are protected by having a trustee who is independent, or by having direct involvement in the fund through having equal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to provide protected information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is another important area. The bill amends the SI(S) Act to allow the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to provide protected information relating to the affairs of the fund to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. Anyone who has had dealings with constituents over their problems with a superannuation fund would know the benefits this amendment will bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tribunal began operations on 1 July this year, and has been largely hailed as a quick and relatively easy forum for dealing with complaints from members of superannuation funds. However, one of the major failings has been caused by the restriction of protected information, particularly where that very information relates to a specific case. This has caused delays and frustration for those people who have been trying to find out information about their fund through the complaints tribunal, so this can only be viewed as a very positive development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment will ensure that disqualified persons are not to be custodians of superannuation funds&mdash;a logical provision which probably should always have been there. The act currently restricts disqualified people from becoming trustees or investment managers of superannuation funds. There is, however, no similar requirement on custodians of the funds. Once again, the government has recognised the possible danger to workers' savings that this shortcoming in the act represents, and this bill will address the problem. The act will be amended to ensure that the custodians are subject to eligibility requirements similar to those that already apply to trustees and investment managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will also create an offence of intentionally acting as a custodian where the person in question is, and knows they are, a disqualified person. The penalty for this is two years imprisonment. I am sure we will all agree that that will serve as a deterrent to some of the less savoury types in the finance field. I am sure we have all heard the stories of con men wrecking people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the removal of trustees of public offer entities. The bill will amend the act by inserting a new requirement that prevents another party from trying to exert influence on a trustee by threatening to remove the trustee unless he or she agrees to comply with that party's request. This will be done by ensuring that unless the regulations provide otherwise, no person other than the commissioner can remove a trustee of a public offer fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, this aspect of the bill is an extremely important and praiseworthy one, particularly when you realise the sorts of figures we are talking about in relation to superannuation. In March this year, the total value of assets in superannuation funds across Australia topped $186 billion. This represents an astonishing 14.5 per cent increase on the total value of assets held in these accounts in the last 12 months. Some 6.1 million Australians aged between 15 and 74 are covered by a superannuation scheme. Superannuation premiums increased by an incredible 38 per cent in the year ending December 1993, to total more than $6.3 billion, so we are talking about vast sums of money here. That money belongs to Australian workers, and it is vital that we provide adequate protection for approved trustees and custodians of superannuation funds to ensure that they do not feel compelled to offer an investment strategy, for example, that would benefit anyone unduly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not as far-fetched as it may at first sound, because 29.7 per cent of the superannuation assets are invested in shares, 7.7 per cent in short term securities and 6.8 per cent in property. We have 44.2 per cent of funds invested in what have proven to be quite lucrative areas, and the temptation would be there for any unscrupulous operators to attempt to increase a fund's exposure to the share market and property particularly. Investment strategy is a topic that tends to involve average fund members only at the annual shareholders meetings, by which time it can be too late to ask questions of the fund managers. Keep in mind also that it is other people's money they are investing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great majority of fund investment managers are professional and highly responsible people. I acknowledge that. But when such vast sums of money are at stake, it is quite right that we acknowledge that the temptation will always be there to manipulate responsible investment strategies, overexposing a portfolio to the shares or derivatives market, for example, for personal gain. It is an important area that we really have to home in on. This temptation not only endangers the savings of workers and average Australians, but it also places in jeopardy the large sums of money that have already been invested by Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at November 1993, employers paid all contributions for 75 per cent of part-time employees and 45 per cent of full-time employees. Employers would regard this as an investment in the future of their work force&mdash;and so they should&mdash;and, therefore, in the long-term future of their business. It is essential for them to have a good solid work force to assist them in the success of their business and hence, of course, to continue to promote job opportunities for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware that I, along with other members, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) included, have been calling for superannuation funds to invest more in Australia and in Australian industry, particularly in infrastructure development and other projects that would have long-term benefits to the economy, creating jobs for future Australians and, of course, current Australians as well. It is an issue that I have concerned myself with for many years. Currently, 82 per cent of total assets in superannuation funds are invested in Australia&mdash;which, of course, is pleasing. Some might see this as a good figure and, indeed, 82 per cent of $186 billion is not to be sneezed at. But the breakdown of areas where these assets are invested is more instructive than just percentage figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, nearly 30 per cent is in shares&mdash;which is fine, if you happen to be a member of a fund that picks a winner on the share market. Another 22.1 per cent is invested in long-term securities&mdash;which, once again, is fine; but government securities are not always used to pay for large scale, long-term infrastructure projects that will not only create jobs but actually encourage the start of completely new industries. A further 18 per cent of that total investment of $186 million is actually invested off-shore in overseas assets. The less than 30 per cent remaining is at present split up between short-term securities, which account for 7.7 per cent, and land and buildings, which account for 6.8 per cent, the remaining 16.7 per cent being spread across various other investment vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to agree with the concept of a national pool of savings, which, of course, would ideally include a contribution from superannuation funds. But my idea would be something along the lines of only one per cent of the fund's assets being put into this national investment pool. That one per cent represents about $l.86 billion, which could be used to fund infrastructure projects that would not only be beneficial to future Australian workers, but would also&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;actually end up returning a profit to the investors themselves&mdash;who, of course, are the members of the superannuation funds. Such a small percentage as one per cent would not put any extra strain on the superannuation funds, and it would be a tremendous investment strategy to assist the growth of industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what my colleague the honourable member for Ryan said in his MPI referred to earlier, this Labor government has never been interested in free lunches. We have only ever been interested in providing the best outcomes for all Australians: workers, industry, unions, communities, families&mdash;the list goes on. That is our commitment to this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that encouraging the development of a national infrastructure fund&mdash;I will call it that, but it does not matter what it is called, as long as it is a fund that can invest in the infrastructure that the Minister for Transport and I agreed on&mdash;is another step in the process of real reform that this government has initiated over the years in the economy generally, and in the superannuation and investment markets in particular. Let me make it quite clear that such a scheme would be handled under the strictest possible supervision. That is the important part and that is what this bill is all about: supervision of superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strict supervision would allow for the creation of investment consortia consisting of representatives from industry, unions, and the investment and finance sector&mdash;people who are on the ball and who know what they are doing on the industry and investment side. I do not have a difficulty with this, but it is important that the members of the fund  also participate in it, whether it be through trade unions or trustees of the fund. Even superannuation funds themselves and any relevant statutory bodies that could approach the issue of long-term infrastructure needs from a new angle and with innovative investment plans could assist in a lot of the development of our industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The percentage of the contribution from the funds is a matter far too complicated to speculate on, but the figure of one per cent of total fund assets has been mentioned. Given the amounts I have mentioned, this is probably a reasonable starting point for debate on the issue. It could always be expanded: one per cent represents $1.86 billion, but two per cent would double that to about $3.7 billion very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to amend the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993, which is another important aspect of this bill and the amendments provided. I have gone through a number of the amendments, and I have expressed some views on superannuation funds because I think it is a very important area, and I think that we can never address it as much as we need to in this place. I believe that the government and the opposition should come together on these issues. When we are thinking about long-term strategies and long-term planning for people's retirement, it is important that our superannuation funds are well-managed and well-supervised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is a further example of this government's commitment to retirement incomes and that is very important. Through superannuation funds, we can provide a better income than any government can provide under any social security system. I am very committed to the enhancement and promotion of superannuation funds, but it is important that all superannuation funds are well-managed and well-supervised. I am pleased that the government has brought forward amendments which will further enhance the strength and confidence of our superannuation funds. I thank members of the Main Committee for their time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, as has been pointed out by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), is essentially designed to ensure accountability and effective supervision of superannuation funds. It is to provide a fair and formal and economic mechanism to resolve disputes arising from superannuation. I was going to compliment my colleague on the substance of his speech and his obvious grasp of the importance of superannuation, until he made his latter comments, which horrified me, about the establishment of a national investment fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has gone straight back to 1987 and reminded me of the ACTU report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>. Ever since then, we have had more than a few members of the government continually playing with the concept of how nice it would be if only we could take one per cent of contributors' investment funds and put them into national infrastructure projects. This dream keeps appearing time and time again. It is interesting that only yesterday at the ASFA conference in Perth, the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;well aware of the very real concern that this attitude is having on the stability of investors within the industry and, above all, on contributors within the industry&mdash;went to considerable lengths to assure those present that the government does not intend to interfere in the decision making process of investors in relation to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I find it extraordinary, in the context of what the Treasurer said yesterday, that we should once again hear today this ageing theme of how nice it would be, if only we could use somebody else's money. If only we could get hold of one per cent&mdash;a mere $1.86 billion, we were told, of contributors' funds&mdash;they say, and put that to work for Australia's infrastructure. If only!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the truth of the matter is that any analysis of the law, any consideration of either this legislation or the earlier legislation in relation to the establishment of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act of 1983&mdash;known in shorthand as the SI(S) Act&mdash;lays down quite conclusively and with complete clarity the fact that trustees of superannuation funds have one fundamental responsibility and that is to ensure that, at all times, the investments made on behalf of their contributors are guaranteed in so far as it is possible to do so on the basis of the right decisions being made, in the interests of the contributors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that they must be made in the interests of the contributors&mdash;not in the interests of the Australian people, not in the interests of whatever Australian government may be there at the time, not to achieve the policy objects of whatever government may be in power at the time, but in the interests of the individual contributors. I find it extraordinary that members of the government, in the face of that unassailable legal requirement placed on trustees, and by extension placed on fund managers, can seriously put forward the proposition of how nice it would be if only they could get their sticky little fingers onto those billions and billions of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what the honourable member said was an isolated case, one would be prepared to forgive it for what it was: the passionate dreams of a backbencher in the Labor government. Unfortunately that is not so. In 1987 the ACTU mission to Europe released its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>, in which one of its objectives was the establishment of a national investment fund. Is it not amazing that the figures we have just heard from the honourable member appeared in the written text of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS> back in 1987? Yes, it wanted one per cent too. Yes, it wanted to utilise superannuation funds to invest in national projects. Ever since that report, we have had many examples of ministers&mdash;and senior ministers at that, not just backbenchers&mdash;who have been only too willing to raise these issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a foreword to that report, Bill Kelty stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We care about nothing less than the reconstruction of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>We all care for the reconstruction of Australia&mdash;it is not just Mr Kelty, not just the ACTU, not just the Labor Party. We all care for it because it is the basis of the creation of job opportunities for our own generation and for those of our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not, in any sense, deny the fact that we cannot have a policy at a national level which interferes in the rights of the individual to make contributions to a superannuation plan, the ostensible objectives of which, according to government policy, no less, are that those people should have greater financial independence in their retirement. But ever since 1987 this ghost, if I may use that term, has come to reappear in various guises on the most extraordinary occasions. Time and time again it reappears. Hooper, Gilchrist and Way in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> on 12 April 1991 referred to the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), then a Labor backbencher. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">O'Keefe argued that super funds provide a long-term capital base that should be tapped&mdash;provided the terms are attractive. Perhaps more importantly, it is consistent with Labor philosophy: a similar line of argument was advanced in the ACTU's 1987 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia reconstructed</EMPHASIS> . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In recent days, we have seen none other than the Minister for Transport apply the `provided the terms are attractive' principle. He came up with a wonderful scheme to get rid of the Australian National Line. His further extension of that philosophy was to try to get rid of a few airports. The concept was `Australian social investment'. The proposal he put forward was quite straightforward. He would offer the trade unions a shareholding in ANL, for example, and, in return for that, nobody would have to pay any tax, except, of course, the Australian taxpayers. They would pay more; but the workers in the industry would not pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, he was finding a mechanism to ensure that, ultimately, one would have to say, `Who could possibly say no to such an outstanding deal?'. I remind honourable members that the minister himself had said, only weeks before, that the ANL `could not be given away'. But he is quite happy to massage the figures in such a way that the funds of employees of those unions contributing to superannuation schemes can be given away. Apparently, their money can be given away with total cynicism, because there is a view in the ALP that what they think does not count. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does count for the opposition. It is a fundamental principle of our approach to social security and superannuation issues that, where people make investments expecting that those funds will be managed wisely for their long-term superannuation and retirement income purposes, they can be protected by the system. We will never lie down and see a government, by one stratagem or another, change the rules of the game in such a way as to take from those individual investors&mdash;little people though they might be&mdash;the right to have security in</PARA>
<PARA>retirement, and the right to depend upon the integrity of the system to which they have been required by law, whether they like it or not, to make contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The record goes right back to 1991, when the then Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), teamed up with his old mates, the then Senators Richardson and Button&mdash;who have both now left us&mdash;to wage what proved to be an unsuccessful campaign aimed at getting superannuation funds to invest more high-risk venture capital in their projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The line they took was that the funds were getting rich only because of the government's superannuation strategy, and that, in return, the funds should be prepared to put money back into areas which would stimulate the economy. At one point, the then Senator Richardson made some not-so-veiled threats that, if the super funds did not comply, the government might have to take stronger measures to point them in the right direction. `Don't do what I do; do what I say' was quite clearly the principle that they were prepared to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same year, the then Senator Button&mdash;who was the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce&mdash;advocated a $1 billion fund for developmental capital. Six big financial institutions were asked to provide $100 million each, to form the basis of Development Capital Ltd, an investment vehicle aimed at medium-sized companies with export prospects in the traded goods area. Trustees of super funds would invest in a company which would have its own board and management team. A series of other projects were put forward by various people in the same year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the then Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), admitted that the government's industry policies had failed to create a climate in which adequate supplies of capital were available to small and medium-sized enterprises. He pointed out, rightly, that a solution was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he did not remove some of the barriers to business investment, which is clearly one of the answers to the problem. He did not even follow the suggestion of another former senator, Susan Ryan, who is now the executive director of ASFA. As was noted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 December 1993, she suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . encouraging the small business sector to better promote itself would resolve the government's predicament. </PARA>
<PARA>The member for Maribyrnong went on to suggest that the government was looking for means `by which superannuation fund managers, or for that matter, capital providers more generally, can be encouraged to invest more of their funds in small and medium-sized enterprises'. Again, it is the fist in the velvet glove that we have seen operating, to one degree or another, for the best part of this decade. Anyway, the honourable member's proposal did not get off the ground either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of all of this, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott)&mdash;I am glad to see he is in the chamber now&mdash;assured the industry that `the government considers that it is generally more appropriate for superannuation funds to be managed and invested along commercial lines in the private sector'. Well may he say that! I sincerely hope that the industry will believe him. Unfortunately, it does not, because it can read; it can also hear. Its members are sensible men and women who can make judgments. They realise that the weight of those judgments will affect hundreds of thousands of Australians and, as we are told, enormous investments made by Australians in superannuation for which they, by law, are accountable and responsible&mdash;not the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the efforts of the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. He made an observation on this which I think is worth quoting. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will take all steps necessary, including an indication of preference in tender documents, to maximise the participation in bidding consortia by Australian superannuation funds, especially industry funds. </PARA>
<PARA>Guess what? Who has at least 50 per cent of the influence in the determination of funding decisions through industry funds? It is the trade union movement. With whom are they associated? The ACTU. So whatever road is taken, one comes back to good old <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that report released by the ACTU back in 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the blueprint for the utilisation of superannuation investments in Australia. One does not have to go beyond that document to see precisely what is this Labor government's hidden agenda. Yes, of course, it is wonderful to be able to turn on the tap of finance and be able to inject it where you will. Look what Labor has achieved in recent years in looking for this fabled good result from investment. In Western Australia, there was WA Inc. and the catastrophe that brought upon the state, as well as on the Labor movement. There was the fiasco and the failure of the South Australian bank; there were the fiascos in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the riddle wrapped in the mystery of incompetence goes on and on&mdash;all because Labor worked on the principle, the flawed principle, that other people's money is easier to control and direct than actually encouraging people to earn money legitimately by changes to micro- and macro-economic policy which effect the overall outcome and make it more effective for people to get a maximum return for their investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of the taxes that could then be gained, the government could make whatever decisions a government is prepared to put before this parliament. But, no, it had to take the back road. It had to take the smart road&mdash;a road which left hundreds of thousands of retired Australians in a situation where their long-term financial viability was put at enormous risk. In many cases they lost their shirts. I have never heard from any responsible state minister or, in a vicarious sort of way, from members of this government, who have now been in office for 11 years, any serious suggestion that mistakes were made which should not have been made. The courts alone have been the authority which has put these people where they belong, behind bars. So many Australians believe that ultimately was the test which they had to sit for, and which they certainly failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I make the coalition's position abundantly clear. The coalition does not believe that governments should in any way meddle or tamper with investments or savings of Australians in this country or elsewhere. Nor does the coalition believe that governments can force investment to happen. In government, consequently, the coalition will not mandate that superannuation funds must invest some proportion of funds in any particular type or class of Australian industry. We will not legislate to hinder or to penalise overseas investment by Australians. We will not use special tax deals to persuade institutions to invest in sectors or industries that would not otherwise be considered as worthwhile investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government should keep its sticky fingers out of the Australian cookie jar. The cookies were put there by hundreds and thousands of individual contributors. It is their money, not the government's. It is their decisions which have to be taken seriously, not the decisions of government. The government's decision must be about providing the climate, the environment, in which fund managers can make the right decisions which will ultimately result in a more viable situation for everybody involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today covers a series of important subjects. They are essentially of an administrative nature; nevertheless they are a series of changes which will have a major impact on the quality of the SI(S) legislation over time. The amendments include: allowing approved guarantees to be given by certain approved non-bank financial institutions; permitting non-arms-length investment transactions, provided conditions are no more favourable than if the transaction were conducted at arms length; allowing for the use of independent trustees or bodies that contain equal representation of employers and members in the supervision of employer sponsored superannuation funds; and providing for the minister to approve public disclosure of information where this is in the public interest and does not unreasonably disclose the personal affairs of an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports all these amendments. They are sensible changes to what is one of the most significant pieces of social legislation to be introduced in recent years. However, there is no way that we are going to support the approach taken by the government by which it wants to interfere in the decision making processes of fund management. Ultimately, that approach is not in the interests of the individual contributor, and it is certainly not in the interests of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In November 1988, 51.3 per cent of the total number of employees in Australia were covered by superannuation. Back in 1983, it was about 30 per cent or perhaps even lower. As I have already indicated, and as everyone knows, that group consisted essentially of male high income earners. By November of last year, the percentage covered by superannuation increased to 80.5 per cent of the total number of employees in Australia. The numbers of full-time employed in November 1988 were 3,491,000, which increased by November 1993 to 5,119,000 and continue to grow. There has been a series of initiatives of enormous significance, a fact that was recognised by the honourable member for Bradfield in the concluding moments of his contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are essentially concerned with questions of prudential and consumer protection and the arrangements that are and should be built into superannuation to ensure that that protection is accorded. That is essentially what this legislation is all about. The details were more than adequately indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott), when he delivered the second reading speech. I do not want to go through all of those details again, but I think it is worth recording the essential elements of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will allow for certain non-bank financial institutions, for example, to offer approved guarantees within the provisions of the superannuation arrangements. It will allow in-house investments in certain non-bank financial institutions as well. Application for the issue of a superannuation interest and application to become a standard employer-sponsor are provided for within the legislation. It also deals with the acquisition of certain assets from members of regulated superannuation funds, the issue of public offer superannuation funds and equal representation, and the existing trustees and the provisions under which they may give notice of retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disclosure of information by the minister is an extension of the legislation. There are certain disclosures which are already provided for; this is a sensible and logical extension in connection with superannuation for the purposes which are indicated in the legislation. Likewise, allowing the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to provide protected information to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal is a perfectly appropriate provision. It gives consideration to the approved purposes of an approved deposit fund and payments to beneficiaries in such a fund; it deals with the question of disqualified persons, who are not to be custodians within the management arrangements of the funds; it deals with the question of the removal of trustees of public offer entities; and it deals with allowing exempted public sector superannuation schemes to become subject to the Superannuation Act 1993. In addition, there are a number of minor revisions. They are all of particular importance to the whole question of the effectiveness and the security with which superannuation funds operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there is the question of whether or not any government will be providing, in a prudential, secure and competent way, arrangements to more effectively deal with retirement incomes and, within the context of this government's approach, to ensure that retirement incomes are supplemented to provide more fully for the retirement comfort of Australians. Further to those considerations, there is also the general question of the important contribution which superannuation makes to the development and flow of savings in Australia, in order to make it possible for Australia, during this period of growth, to have access to sufficient  investment resources to undertake the sort of investment that we need. That is important as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those objectives are going to be achieved, it is absolutely essential that the superannuation funds and the arrangements under which they operate are placed on a sufficiently secure and prudentially proper foundation to have credibility. People need to feel confident that the contributions which are being made by them, and for them, are being made into arrangements which are credible and which will achieve the objectives that have been set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention a comment from Professor David Knox of Melbourne University. Professor Knox is an acknowledged authority on superannuation. He has commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The desire for a high level of confidence in the system has led the government to strengthen the prudential arrangements for superannuation with the SIS legislation and the general thrust of this legislation is to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Knox is a person whose competence in this area is well recognised; he does a lot of commissioned work on behalf of the superannuation industry. As an academic who is involved full-time in this area, he has put his imprimatur on what the government is seeking to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a large and growing superannuation industry of the kind that we have in Australia, there is obviously a need for the prudential security that has been provided by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. There is an enormous diversity of funds in Australia. I have some reservations about that diversity and the type of problems that it creates for the successful surveillance and supervision of the industry. There are 73,000 funds and some of those funds have less than five members. That is a matter to which consideration needs to be given. As of October 1993, over six million workers were covered by those funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take special pride in saying that almost two million low income workers are included in that figure. When they retire, they may well depend primarily, as most Australians do, upon the age pension. However, the government is telling those people that it will make it possible for them, during their working lives, to accumulate an entitlement to superannuation benefits which will supplement the age pension, and which will make their retirement that much better. I believe that is something to be applauded. I applaud it and I applaud the general approach that this government has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that some of the criticisms and concerns that have been raised about the number of changes made since 1983 are legitimate. But I emphasise that those changes have been made since 1983&mdash;since a Labor government was in the national parliament introducing changes to ensure that the whole of the superannuation structure was appropriate and that people were covered: they were safeguarded and their retirement would be complemented in such a way as to improve the quality of their lives in their retirement. The additional funds being generated would be directed in prudential and proper ways into investment arrangements in Australia. None of these things were undertaken prior to 1983. Why would there not have been changes since 1983?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the litany of wasted opportunities which the honourable member for Curtin referred to. The people on the opposition benches shout, rant, rave and interject in order to cover their own confusion, their inadequacy and their feeling of guilt because of that litany of wasted opportunities that in a sense they can, I suppose, claim credit for prior to 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian superannuation funds at the present time hold assets in excess of $160 billion&mdash;closer to $180 billion. I have seen a number of figures for this and I am not sure which I can depend upon except the one provided to me by my good friend and colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. It is an enormous reserve of investment funds available to help develop this country as well as to provide for people in their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the initial three per cent productivity superannuation trade-off, the claim has been made that all the contribution towards industry superannuation at the present time is being made by employers. That is simply not correct. People say that the employers cannot afford it, yet they do not have to afford it. It came out of the pockets of workers. It was a trade-off against a productivity gain that would have put money into the pockets of workers and into their family budgets if it had been paid to them as a productivity wage increase. It was a remarkable response on the part of the trade union movement and the ACTU when they said that they were prepared to forgo that money in the pocket to help provide for retirement income. That was the first three per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that later on there will be contributions which will be identified as contributions from employers, some of which have already started. But there is also a suggestion at this stage that towards the end of this period, during which the superannuation contribution as a proportion of wages will grow to about 12 per cent, the last three per cent will be considered as well to be a direct contribution from employees themselves. Let us not hear all of this nonsense about whether or not it can be afforded. Of course it can be afforded. It represents an effective national saving which needs to be afforded if we are going to have the capacity to fund the sort of investment that Australia needs in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That minimum support, at the present time, is five per cent. If there were 100 per cent cover of all employees in Australia at the present time, in connection with that five per cent, that would be channelling into our investment and savings capacity $12,000 million every year. By the year 2002, when it will be up to nine per cent, again if that covers 100 per cent of employees, in today's dollar terms it will be ploughing in $22,000 million every year for investment purposes. That is a matter of enormous public sector importance and of enormous national importance, and is the sort of thing to which any responsible, planning, deliberate national government would give consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Vince FitzGerald in his national savings report estimated that the superannuation guarantee arrangements would eventually increase total private savings by about 1.25 per cent of GDP each year. In today's dollar terms, that amounts to 1.25 per cent of $425,000 million&mdash;$425 billion&mdash;or $5.3 billion each year. That is an enormous increase in the volume of funds which are going to be made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been concerned to put in place a comprehensive superannuation system under which all Australians will be contributing to their own retirement incomes and helping to enhance their own retirement security and comfort. This will also be done by forgoing current consumption, which, of course, all savings represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACTU, the trade union movement and Australian employees have cooperated in this approach. Not only does it benefit them but also it benefits national purposes. The system has been designed to embrace everyone for the first time ever in the history of this Commonwealth and let the record show it clearly and proudly. For the first time ever, a national Labor government put in place a superannuation arrangement which will cover every Australian. It covers the question of portability for casual employees and part-time employees: they can build up a retirement benefit and they can carry it with them. The benefit will be maintained. The provisions have been put in place to ensure that the commission and other types of arrangements do not destroy that accumulated benefit. All these things have been put in place through the Taxation Office to ensure that these people receive protection and to ensure that they will benefit. This will grow progressively to ensure that the two fundamental elements are achieved: firstly, security in retirement; and, secondly, an appropriate flow of savings to guarantee the investment capacity of Australia now and increasingly into the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot imagine how a man who I believe is an intelligent person can proclaim as a virtue the predictable mess created by the government in the superannuation field. The incredible shambles of superannuation is driving people to other forms of investment. The unpredictable nature of what the government has created has meant that people are looking for alternatives for investment because superannuation is completely unsatisfactory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For weeks, months and years, the government procrastinated on any decisions in regard to casual and part-time employees. The government knew the mess that it was creating. It knew how much it would cost part-time or casual employees; the cost of administration would take away the savings the government proclaimed it was making. It was put into the tax office and it turned the tax office into something that it should not be. I cannot understand why the honourable member has not been able to advance some further ideas for improvement instead of proclaiming that the  situation is acknowledged nationwide amongst employees as completely unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have been applauded by the honourable member. Some of these changes seek to rectify faults of the previous government. I draw the honourable member's attention to the arms-length transaction changes. On coming into office in 1983, the government said, `Look at these terrible private superannuation funds. Those people in private enterprise are a bunch of cheats. They set up a superannuation fund. They borrow from it and they plough it back into the business. That is a terrible thing to do.' The government wiped that out. Today, it is again instigating that process because it was mistaken, wrong and stupid in its assessment. The government could have moved to the point of a non-arms-length relationship. But it refused to listen to the opposition. It said, `All private enterprise is bad. Employers are a bunch of rip-off merchants.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of making changes that would have pulled out the cherry picking processes&mdash;and I said at the time that the government should have done that&mdash;the government went right past it and wiped out every opportunity for reinvestment. The arms-length transactions that are being proposed here so that there should be no advantage in a non-arms-length transaction which cannot be obtained in an arm's length transaction is a sensible provision. I applaud this change but the government has wasted over 10 years of possible investment in Australia by allowing private enterprise to use the capital it was accumulating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed in this area because it has no strategy for national savings of any sort. The savings program in Australia has worked because we have got one of the lowest savings ratios of any nation on earth, and the government has encouraged that by the policies it has created. The government's national economic policies, with high inflation and high interest rates, have discouraged people from any concept of saving. It is too risky for the average householder to save other than by putting funds into bricks and mortar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) realises that when the government runs a high inflation and high interest regime people feel an uncertainty. People put faith only in what they can grab at the moment. To invest in the long-term bond or share market is unattractive. People have seen what has happened with the manipulation by the so-called high fliers of the 1980s. That sort of investment is unattractive to most Australians. They do not understand it, it seems too risky and they are afraid of losing assets they have created, because of some person manipulating the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is a slow and steady way of making savings, but there have been many confusing changes to this whole process and small yields for many people in the government's regime. Initially people started to be attracted to this but at this point in our history people are moving away from superannuation in their savings regimes. People have tended to invest in bricks and mortar and traditional investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not applied its mind to the process of savings in Australia. It is presenting this superannuation change as the single plank of savings policy. It cannot do that. There must be a multiplicity of opportunities for people to invest in Australia, or in Australian institutions. The government has rightly said, `We need to have a savings policy.' What the government then does is go out on the market and borrow those Australian savings to fund its own mismanagement of the Australian economy. Under those circumstances, where does private enterprise then go to borrow money for advancement and development? It goes offshore and people wonder why we have got a foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has created that by running a high deficit and by borrowing on the local market. The cost of money to the government does not matter. High interest rates do not really matter to the government. Borrowing overseas has not contributed in any great extent to the foreign debt but the government has forced others to do that by the regime it has run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no attempt to address the problem of the national savings policy. We must have a policy and incentive must be provided for people to save. This is the big stick way of providing savings. Hand this big stick over to employers and say, `Put that money in.' There should be a change in ethos and attitude, and an encouragement for the average mum and dad&mdash;or young couple or person preparing for marriage or for a working life&mdash;who want to save to enter into a regime that they personally control, not a compulsory thing that is applied by the boss and that they have no say in. There is no commitment in the present process. There is no understanding of the benefits of a long-term saving regime to a family or to an individual in the way in which the government has approached this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying, `Aussies are too dumb to go into a savings program on their own. We won't provide incentives, so we'll make it a forced process.' It is an educative and encouragement role that needs to be provided. The government is not doing that. The coalition believes there should be a national savings program and we will be providing incentives for that to occur. It must be joint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not decrying the government's efforts completely, but I think the government has used a very prescriptive, rigid approach. Ultimately, it will yield no commitment on the part of the individual who is supposed to be making the saving. Ultimately, for many of the people who are involved in the superannuation schemes that the government has put under the aegis of the union movement, there will be no yield when they reach retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the specifics of the legislation, it is a sensible change to bring in the non-bank financial institutions which are defined under the various financial institutions acts or codes of New South Wales, Victoria and the rest of the states. It is sensible to allow non-bank financial institutions to offer approved guarantees that currently are offered only by approved banks and the Commonwealth, states or territories. This change broadens the prospects for non-bank financial institutions. The clause amends the definition to read `approved non-bank financial institutions'. These are bodies recognised under the various laws and comprise building societies and other groups such as that. I have no problem with that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arms-length transactions should never have been removed. The proposition to put them back is a commonsense reaction to a stupid anti-business reaction in 1983-84. The government went too far with that and it is now acknowledging that with these changes. The government tarred everyone with the same brush and said, `You're all bad news.' It was the only area in the whole business that needed to be dealt with. The government fooled around with it for ages. Meanwhile, people were ripping off funds and buzzing off overseas, and Hurford would not take action. It was a cherry picking process and there was manipulation. So the government fiddled with that and then it went in with a sledgehammer, but it did not need to go to the extent that it did to rectify the obvious problems. The problems had been partially dealt with by the coalition when it was in government. The Labor government needed to go further and it did. I applaud the intention but the result is now having to be rectified 10 years later. What a waste of investment. What a waste of productivity. What a waste of opportunity the government has created by being overzealous in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are provisions in this legislation that deal with the options for control and management of standard employer-sponsored funds. The amendment is proposing the way in which boards and trusts will be made up and, as my colleague the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has said, the criteria are now there to ensure that the interests of the members are looked after. I also applaud the government for that. But, again, it is probably three or four years too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government went on a wild kick and said, `We will let the unions into the super field,' the opposition advised against that. `It would be a great thing for the unions to have,' said the government, and it was. We had Norm Gallagher and all of these blokes out of Melbourne as trustees to funds. The government knew that was stupid, but it would not admit it at the time. Norm was a trustee of the building industry fund. I do not want to blacken people's names completely, but we did have people with almost criminal records responsible for the funds of workers. They had no interest in how well those funds were going for the workers, and it is a lot of hogwash to suggest that they did. The government now knows that, and it is admitting it with the changes that it is now making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is admitting that it was a fraud to present Normie and all of the boys as being good, upright citizens capable of being trustees of complicated investment insurance funds, and capable of making decisions on behalf of their members. However, that was not the case. The government is now recognising that, and it is saying that people must be properly equipped and they must have a code of behaviour that takes into account the interests of their members and the interests of members of the funds. That is absolutely spot on. What a shame it is that the government would not admit at the time that there needed to be a code of conduct, and that there needed to be a proper process by which trustees of funds were selected to ensure they had the qualities that were needed to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the savings capacity of Australia and the importance of superannuation as a very important plank in the process of developing a savings policy. Previous speakers have mentioned the contribution of Dr Vince FitzGerald. Although the government has ignored that report, FitzGerald opened up something that could be looked at either by a parliamentary committee or through a more detailed and lengthy discussion in the parliament. If the government is serious about commissioning inquiries such as the FitzGerald report on national savings, it should have a process whereby it has a more open debate than it has been prepared to have on the general issue of savings. The FitzGerald report was a good starting point, but the government found much of it unacceptable, and simply ditched it, leaving it to gather dust on the shelves. That is a shame, because it could have been a start of a changed regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is a bit precious in the way in which it behaves. This stems from the character of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating): any opinion which is slightly at variance with his own views must be wrong and is not accepted. Two years later, he might come back to it, knowing that it is right, but he is not sufficiently confident of his own ability to take advice, pick it up and turn it into something good. I believe that is what happened with the FitzGerald report. Anything that does not agree with the Prime Minister's first impression is rejected&mdash;he says that it is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is currently investigating a goods and services tax&mdash;a broad based consumer tax&mdash;and here we see the hypocrisy of government members, in the way that they behaved during the election campaign. They know very well that Treasury and its committees are now looking at a goods and services tax, or VAT, a value added broad based consumer tax. That is happening because the government does not know where it is going to get the dough from to run Australia. It has the hypocrisy to pick up something that it canned mercilessly and endlessly for 12 months. </PARA>

In one instance, it has clung for 10 years  to an attitude that was wrong and outdated, and now it has made a modification. It has lost by that process and Australia has been the poorer.

The government does not have to give away all of its ideology, but it could make this nation much better by adopting a national savings policy that is workable. It could moderate its demand on funds by running a lower deficit than is now the case. That would be beneficial to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some experience in this area some time ago, just prior to the introduction of occupational superannuation, dealing with total and permanent benefit claims for injured workers who are members of company superannuation schemes. While dealing with those claims, something that stood out more than anything else was the gross inadequacy of existing processes to enable workers to challenge decisions that had been made with respect to their total and permanent disablement benefit claims by the insurers backing the funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my experience, companies such as AMP were generally quite fair in the way that they dealt with these disablement benefit claims. National Mutual was not so bad, but some of the others were pretty horrendous. A person virtually had to be in a wheelchair and have a seeing eye dog before he or she would even be considered to be totally and permanently disabled. Many injured workers, therefore, who quite clearly were never going to work again had their claims rejected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where they then ran into some problems because, in the circumstances they faced, the only option they had was to take legal proceedings to the Supreme Court or the county court to allege either breach of trust or breach of contract or both. Naturally enough, those proceedings were probably a fifty-fifty bet in terms of likelihood of success and of course required significant funds to finance them. Naturally, if the injured worker was unsuccessful, the case would lead to fairly substantial awards of costs against the injured worker on top of his or her own outlay with respect to costs to finance the case itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in jurisdictions such as workers compensation, for example, because of the large volume of claims and the structures associated with those jurisdictions, it was possible for injured workers to pursue claims disputing findings about whether or not they had sustained incapacitating injuries as a result of their employment, without undertaking serious financial risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems, in effect, made it virtually impossible for injured workers to pursue disablement benefit applications in the normal legal system. So if their claim was arbitrarily rejected by one of the less scrupulous insurers backing these particular disablement benefit structures in the trust deed, then there was virtually nothing they could do about it. As a result, many injured workers in that period, who had been under the impression that they were covered by these clauses in their superannuation trust deed, missed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many occasions when I was a lawyer, I had the unpleasant duty of advising injured workers&mdash;often middle-aged, male, lower-skilled workers who had suffered injuries that would prevent them from ever working again in anything for which they were remotely suited&mdash;that, in spite of what they had been told by their employer when they signed on to the superannuation scheme and in spite of what was written in the booklet advertising the details of the superannuation scheme, the disablement benefit that they thought they would be entitled to was not going to be available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that legal proceedings are currently under way in Victoria, seeking to establish a test case on this issue, with respect to both breach of trust and breach of contract. One of the great problems in pursuing these cases is the old breach of contract problem of privity of contract and the fact that if you are a third party to the contract then you cannot be sued on the basis of that contract. Of course, the insurer, who is effectively making the decision about whether the disablement benefit claim would be acceded to or not, is a third party to the contract. The case of Trident v. McNiece established that that principle did not apply in the workers compensation situation, but the matter of whether that will be extended to total and permanent disablement benefits is yet to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding this point, I again congratulate the government for determining to include these issues within the ambit of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal and also to ensure that the decisions of the tribunal are only appealable on issues of law to the Federal Court. That will mean that, for the first time, workers in this country have an accessible process available to them to get proper independent judicial decisions about disputes with respect to superannuation matters, be they medical disputes about disablement claims or disputes relating to other issues. That is a major step forward. As somebody who has had some experience in dealing with these issues at first-hand, I can say quite clearly that there will be a lot of ordinary Australian workers who will benefit as a result of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I would like to refer to also relates to death and disablement benefits in superannuation schemes, and that is the definition of `dependant' in the regulations with respect to the application of death benefits in superannuation schemes. At the moment, we have an unfortunate situation in the case of same-sex couples. Even if an individual who is a member of a same-sex couple nominates his or her partner as the beneficiary in the event of death with respect to superannuation entitlements, in many circumstances that nomination is meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the partner is quite clearly financially dependent upon the deceased partner, he or she is unable to get the death benefit payment from the superannuation fund. The reason is in the way that the death benefits regulations are structured. A `dependant' is defined on the basis of sexual relationship rather than on the basis of the actual nature of the relationship and whether there is financial or economic dependency there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most recently in Melbourne, we had a situation where there were two men who were partners living in an established long-term relationship. Both of them had AIDS, and one of them died. The surviving partner&mdash;in spite of the fact that he had been nominated by the deceased partner as the beneficiary in his occupational superannuation scheme in the event of his death&mdash;was unable to claim the death benefit; yet it was obvious that he, more than virtually anybody else, had a very clear financial need to claim that death benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that we should not allow unrestricted choice on the part of members of superannuation schemes to nominate death beneficiaries, because there is a social purpose behind the death benefit structure in superannuation schemes. It is designed to ensure that dependants of deceased beneficiaries of superannuation schemes are not left in sudden and extreme poverty, and that there is at least some payment to allow them to overcome the economic loss arising from the death of the beneficiary. I would argue that we should make that definition non-discriminatory. We should focus not on the sexual nature of the relationship between the dependants, but simply on the nature of the economic or financial relationship and the potential consequence of death for that dependence. Therefore we should have a non-discriminatory definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note also that there are proceedings currently in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which will test whether my interpretation of the existing definition in the regulations is correct, and it may well be that any changes to the regulations may be unnecessary if the AAT hands down a finding that the existing definition is in fact wide enough to encompass same-sex relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to move on to the broader question of the general structure of superannuation in this country. In some respects, I&mdash;like the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman)&mdash;do not think that the existing situation is perfect, but I come to this question from a slightly different perspective, that of somebody who is still basically a supporter of the 1975 Hancock report and the concept of a totally integrated national superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occupational superannuation structure that we have introduced under this government is essentially a compromise position from the rag-tag situation we had prior to 1983, when the majority of the population had no superannuation coverage. That majority was overwhelmingly the lower paid, particularly women. The structure that has been introduced is essentially a compromise which has had the benefit of extending superannuation to the vast bulk of the population, which is a major advance that cannot be questioned, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was centrally involved, along with the former assistant secretary of the ACTU, Garry Weaven, in negotiating what I believe to be the first major common rule award provision with respect to occupational superannuation, which was to apply to large numbers of workers&mdash;union members and non-union members&mdash;in 1989. That provision was certainly a major step forward for members of my union and for lower paid workers, particularly women workers, who previously had had no superannuation and had been excluded from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is worth noting that there is still a range of anomalies in the structure that we have at present. We need to address these anomalies in the long term. There is a clear gender bias because of the tendency for women, more so than men, to move in and out of the work force and, therefore, women's ability to accumulate superannuation entitlements is inevitably restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lower paid and particularly casual workers will also receive less than higher paid and full-time workers. The administration costs associated with administering a complex scheme of this nature, which varies from award to award and imposes those costs directly on businesses administering the scheme, must also be questioned. There are complexities associated with transferring membership of schemes and multiple membership. The problem of small sums has been addressed by the government, but it is still a complexity which exists because of the way in which the need to provide universal superannuation has been approached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Occupational superannuation in effect functions as a small additional tax on employment, and that is clearly a matter of concern. The extent to which that causes problems has been grossly exaggerated by some people in the business community. Nonetheless it is still an issue. Personally, I believe it would be better if it were attached to the personal income taxation of individuals, rather than being equivalent to a payroll tax. There are also substantial compliance problems because of the nature of the structure of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems that we now have with the structure is that ultimately we have a de facto tax delivering billions of dollars not to the government, but to the large superannuation funds such as National Mutual and AMP, with very limited accountability on the part of the beneficiaries. Thus enormous economic power is being handed to organisations like AMP and National Mutual, with very limited accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those companies are starting to use that power in a more interventionist way, as in the case of the change of management at Goodman Fielder Ltd. Notionally, superannuation funds that were held on my behalf, and on behalf of hundreds of thousands of others, were at play in those sorts of decisions. Unlike taxation, where people can vote the government that is making those decisions on how to spend that money into or out of office, the ability to do so with respect to those large superannuation funds is far more limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion on that point, I fundamentally philosophically support a universal single superannuation scheme. I concede that the proposition in the Hancock report that there be a single fund with a single, in effect, public sector investment decision making process is probably not appropriate. It is probably not politically acceptable in this day and age. Therefore, if we were to move to a single universal scheme, we could do so on the basis of contracting out the investment process to a variety of players in the investment market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus there would be a single fund, a single administration and a single collection of moneys. The process of investing those funds could be contracted out to, for example, AMP and National Mutual and the various other players in the game. They would then have to compete with each other on the basis of investment performance. That is an idea that needs to be pursued in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment relates to the introduction of employee contributions for occupational superannuation. The government is committed to it. I argue that we should consider doing at least the first stage of that in the very near future, if for no other reason than as a demand management tool. If we are to calm down the economic recovery that is now well under way and make sure that inflationary pressures and the current account problem do not get out of hand, then there are alternatives to interest rate increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major alternative that we need to consider is the introduction of the first one per cent of that three per cent that we are committed to introducing by the year 2002-3. This would have a variety of benefits. Obviously, the optimum time to introduce these employee contributions would be when growth and employment are improving strongly, rather than when we are in recession. Although there would be a displacement effect to some degree with respect to saving, that would probably be less than half and therefore there would be a significant increase in national savings. The structural economic problem of inadequate savings would be addressed in a way that interest rate increases do not address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effective equity of introducing this levy of employer superannuation contributions would be much more than interest rate increases and it would be unlikely to flow through into higher wage claims in the same way as interest rate increases. It would have roughly the same macro-economic effect as a taxation increase. Aggregate savings would be increased, current disposable income would be reduced and this would dampen down aggregate demand. The final benefit of this type of approach would be that, unlike interest rate increases, it would not act as a disincentive to investment. The great problem with increasing interest rates, as we witnessed in 1988-89, is that ultimately it causes a crunch with business investment, whereas introducing the first stage of employee superannuation contributions would not do that. In fact, it would provide additional funds for investment, so it would have precisely the reverse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government to consider introducing that first stage of the employee superannuation contribution at some stage in the first half of next year. I think it would be the optimum time to do so for reasons of macro-economic management. It is also something that is obviously critical to the ultimate achievement of a just and effective superannuation and retirement incomes policy for this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For 17 1/2 minutes he was, in fact, making observations about directing investments. At the ASFA conference yesterday, the Western Australian Minister for Finance opened the conference and chided all the delegates because they were not making enough investment in the resource industries of Western Australia, and the like. He also has responsibility for the TAB. He drew the parallel that superannuation funds should be looking not only at the TAB type of guarantee arrangements with investments but also at all those great opportunities in resource and entrepreneurial sectors, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for the Western Australian Minister for Finance to say that but, if one of our members makes similar sorts of observations, the world is supposed to fall in, according to the honourable member for Bradfield. The fact of the matter is that what the government has taken as a very conscious decision is an approach under SI(S) that directs the responsibility of the investment strategy onto the trustees to develop. It is a process that places legal obligations as part of that process. Aside from the direct prudential issues that are involved in that, the government has made it particularly clear in SI(S) that neither the government nor any other party has any role in the process beyond that. It is the direct responsibility of the trustees to formulate the investment strategy. The Treasurer made the point yesterday, at that conference. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SI(S) legislation emphasises that primary responsibility for the prudent management of the fund rests with the trustees. It prohibits trustees from acting under instruction from outside parties. Naturally, the government welcomes the superannuation fund investments in areas such as emerging technologies, regional industries and infrastructure as part of a balanced investment portfolio. But the government has repeatedly said it will not force or mandate superannuation funds or trustees to invest in particular areas.</PARA>
<PARA>I reiterate that there is absolutely no intention on the government's part of changing this, and this SI(S) amendment package does nothing of the sort. In fact, it strengthens the provisions relating to the prudential regime and makes some variations in the light of the experience that we have had in recent times, but ensures that those fundamentals that apply under SI(S) in terms of trustee obligations on investment, and therefore their responsibility to fund members, are very much at the forefront in their legal obligations. Nothing is going to change that. It does not matter that we get comments of one sort or another, be they from the Western Australian Minister for Finance or someone else; those fundamentals will still be there. That is not to say that that diversified investment portfolio does not open up the options of picking up all the different possibilities as far as investment is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other thing that was notable, given the member for Bradfield's comments about the government's approach to these issues, was that the president of ASFA made the point yesterday that ASFA was in fact formed because the Menzies government in 1961 was talking about taking steps to direct where superannuation funds were to go. They formed the association, which has now been going for 33 years, because of the Menzies government's proposals in relation to superannuation. So we see the sort of nonsense that is really behind that comment that the member for Bradfield made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that the superannuation guarantee is a fundamental part of our national savings strategy. Superannuation savings today through the super guarantee represent $185 billion and by the year 2002, when the full transition process comes into effect, will represent $450 billion in contributions to national savings. And the opposition, for all its talk about national savings, still has in The Things That Matter document the fact that it is going to freeze the superannuation guarantee at its current level, a direct negative in terms of national savings. </PARA>

Because of the forgone salary that they could have achieved, they have made those commitments to long-term savings through superannuation. So the fact is that the opposition's approach to freezing the superannuation guarantee would have a very negative effect on national savings, and that is not disputed by anybody in the industry. The industry itself is calling on the opposition to abandon that short-sighted policy that it had in Fightback and that it still has in The Things That Matter document.

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act was one of the elements of the government's Public Service reform package in 1984. The act provided for the establishment of the Merit Protection and Review Agency, the MPRA, as an independent statutory authority responsible for handling grievances and appeals of public servants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation&mdash;fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations.

In its first 10 years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments cover a range of matters designed to facilitate and improve the performance of the MPRA's functions and to further the objectives contained in the act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for the MPRA to deem a promotion appeal to be an application for review and vice versa to help avoid situations where an officer with an otherwise valid entitlement may be disadvantaged because of his or her lack of detailed knowledge of the relevant legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The average time taken within TGA to list and register products depends on the type of product; in the area of interest the average time taken in 1993-94 for listing was 91 working days and for registration 67 working days.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Universities provide statements on their sources of income as part of their annual returns to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Included in those returns are data on their income from endowments and private donations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The data, however should be treated with caution. This is because universities are in the transitional phase of changing from one method of financial reporting to another. By 1995, all universities will have changed over to more streamlined arrangements based on accrual accounting practices. As a consequence of the changeover, it is not possible to make comparisons between years for universities, or between universities in a given year.</PARA>
