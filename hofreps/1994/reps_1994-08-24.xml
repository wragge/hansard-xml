<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Taxation Amendment Bill (No. 3). This is a miscellaneous taxation amendment bill and has no central theme. I wish to concentrate on a few issues that are touched upon by the amendment bill. These relate to the question of regional headquarters of multinational companies in Australia, the new home child-care allowance linked to the dependent spouse rebate; and those provisions of the bill which affect child-care centres and the sales tax regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset it is important to make some general points that relate to Australia as a taxing country. Firstly, Australia is a low tax country; and, secondly, the government is the low tax party. What we are trying to achieve in Australia&mdash;and we are making considerable progress&mdash;is a low tax, low inflation, high growth, high productivity, high employment, high wage country. Our low tax country and low tax party status is reflected in the budget papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always useful to refer to the budget papers in the course of debate. I refer to the 1994-95 Budget Paper No. 1. If one looks at the statements on revenue on page 4.3, one finds the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Revenue in 1994-95 . . . represents 23.7 per cent of GDP . . .</PARA>
<PARA>If one goes on to page 4.15 to see how that is raised, one sees an important comment which reflects the government's commitment to a low tax regime. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Factors restricting taxation revenue growth in 1994-95 are the full-year effect of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the personal income tax cuts introduced on 15 November 1993; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the company tax rate reduction and general investment allowance announced during the 1993 Federal election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important point in respect of taxation needs to be made. At the last election we on this side went to the Australian people with a commitment to reduce the company taxation rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent, while those opposite went to the people with a commitment to increase the rate to 45 per cent plus a 15 per cent GST. While there is no central theme to this particular taxation amendment bill, it reflects our commitment to low tax and shows the stark contrast between our commitment on this side and the commitment which those opposite took to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the question of regional headquarters. In the course of his second reading speech, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Working Nation the government announced a number of measures aimed at enhancing Australia's attractiveness as a regional headquarters location. The initiatives in this bill will improve Australia's attractiveness as a location for the Asia-Pacific regional headquarters of large transnational corporations, including Australian companies. The measures contained in this bill should provide a climate that attracts and retains multinationals without compromising the integrity of our taxation system.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to make the point that the cost to revenue of these measures is in the order of $40 million in 1994-95. This measure was one of those measures in the Working Nation statement which reflect the philosophy and the commitment behind Working Nation, the notion of `growth plus'. That reflects two things: firstly, to ensure employment growth we need to maximise growth in the economy but, secondly, to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up as part of economic recovery, we need to take additional measures. That is reflected by the shorthand term `growth plus'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are measures which we will debate later today on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> which reflect some of the `plus' measures. These are contained in the Employment Services Bill. So far as maximising economic growth is concerned, the incentives to ensure that regional headquarters are located in Australia are simply a small part of the great range of measures which are incentives for investment in Australia. In the 1994-95 financial year there are in the order of $3 billion worth of incentives for investment within Australia either by Australian companies or by foreign companies. Those measures, which make up the $3 billion, go from accelerated depreciation measures, the development allowance measures, the general investment allowance and the 150 per cent research and development concession. I have referred to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. They also include the amendments which we debated in the last session to pool development funds and also the incentives to improve investment in infrastructure by way of infrastructure bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth referring to the Working Nation document to see that reflected in the statement. The Working Nation statement, chapter 3, which starts at page 51, refers to industry development policies. This chapter of Working Nation reflects in very many respects the notion of maximising growth in the economy. At page 54 is a heading `Key industry policy initiatives'. This reflects the range of measures that the Working Nation statement introduced which have the effect of maximising economic growth in our economy. Those measures included better access for smaller firms to research and development incentives, greater commercialisation of research and development, increased funding for science, improved investment incentives for pooled development funds, the expansion of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation facilities, better access to industry for government purchasing, improved export marketing and promotion, government enterprise programs brought together under the banner of AusIndustry and the one that we are expressly dealing with today, attraction of regional headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 82 of Working Nation one finds in some detail the government's commitment to the promotion of international investment and business linkages. The philosophy behind that is also found at the top of page 82:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will place a major priority on broadening and deepening the investment linkages between Australia and overseas markets. With increasingly mobile capital and a continuing demand for investment in newly industrialising countries, it is critical that government and business work together to promote the advantages of Australia as an investment destination.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on to say on pages 82 and 83:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional headquarters (RHQs) provide a number of direct and indirect economic benefits to the Australian economy, generally stemming from the high skill and high wage jobs they generate. The direct benefits come from expenditure on locally produced goods and services and the taxation revenue paid by the RHQs and their employees. RHQs tend to have a strong demand for specialist professional skills, telecommunications, international travel and data processing. Indirect benefits come from management skills and know-how, the flow of business intelligence about markets in the region and the ability to influence the parent company.</PARA>
<PARA>In referring to the measures which the Working Nation statement committed the government to and which are implemented by the bill before the House, I quote again from the Working Nation statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding our many advantages, the competition to attract regional headquarters operations in the Asia-Pacific region is fierce, and the Government has recently put in place a number of measures aimed at enhancing Australia's attractiveness as a RHQ location. These include the provision of a wholesale sales tax exemption for imported used computer and computer related equipment for RHQ investment proposals . . . and the eligibility of RHQs for Feasibility Study Fund grants under the Government's Investment Promotion Program.</PARA>
<PARA>The measures this bill effects are the wholesale sales tax exemption and credit for imported use computer related equipment, tax deductibility of certain costs of locating regional headquarters in Australia and the removal of withholding taxes on certain dividends distributed throughout Australia. Although this particular measure is a small part of the One Nation statement, accounting for $40 million in the 1994-95 financial year, it does reflect the government's commitment to maximising growth in our economy and reflects, hand in hand, the dual commitment the government has to ensuring that with economic recovery comes maximum economic growth and with economic growth comes special additional measures to ensure that the long-term unemployed are picked up as part of the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure that I wish to refer to relates to the home child-care allowance. When considering the philosophy behind the home child-care allowance, it is important not to do as some people in the community and some opposite do, and that is to glibly make a contrast between the home child-care allowance and the child-care cash rebate. The home child-care allowance is an important addition to a vast array of family support measures that this government has implemented. I think it is important to look at the starting point for the family support measures that the government has introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophy of the government over the last 10 years in relation to the support of families has been to try to target assistance to families to ensure that those most in need are helped. That is reflected by the regime that is currently in place with the basic family payment and the additional family payment. As members will be aware, the basic family payment is available to families whose income is up to about $60,000, depending upon the number of children. The additional family payment is available to those families whose income is up to about $25,000. The precise cut off points vary depending upon the number of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount expended on the basic family payment and the additional family payment is in the order of $5 to $6 billion per annum. That is $5 to $6 billion in recurrent expenditure to give assistance to low and middle income earning families in our country. The vast bulk of money for the additional family payment certainly goes to one income families. It is true to say that the majority of the basic family payment&mdash;given that we are looking at a cut-off point of $60,000&mdash;also goes to one income families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one highlights the figure of $5 billion to $6 billion in recurrent expenditure for family payments, what amount goes to the home child-care allowance and what amount goes to the child-care cash rebate? The effect of cashing out the dependent spouse rebate will result in an annual recurrent expenditure of about $1 billion. The dependent spouse rebate and its conversion to a cash payment and the topping up of that cash payment which has taken place will result in another billion dollars being expended by the government to assist low and middle income families and, in particular, one-income families with children. So, in addition to the basic family payment and the additional family payment, another $1 billion is being expended on the home child-care allowance. So we are now outlaying between $6 billion to $7 billion by way of assistance to families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately $230 million will be expended on a recurrent basis in order to top up the dependent spouse rebate. When the dependent spouse rebate is cashed out by these measures, it is also increased and rounded off as a $30 payment. The expenditure effect of the topping up of the dependent spouse rebate is about $230 million. So that is the magnitude of the expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, some people simply compare the home child-care allowance with the child-care cash rebate. That is a glib and a faulty comparison which does not bear up to analysis. The total cost of the child-care cash rebate program per annum is about $155 million. Some $155 million per annum is being spent on the child-care cash rebate, $1 billion per annum is being spent on the home child-care allowance and $230 million per annum is the effect of the dependent spouse rebate being topped up to a $30 payment. That is in addition to the $5 billion to $6 billion that we outlay per annum in the form of the basic family payment and the additional family payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite who argue that a negative comparison ought to be made between this government's support for people who care for their children at home and government support for people who take advantage of child-care assistance measures need to ensure that glib and faulty comparisons are not made. They need to ensure that the total outlays on assistance to low and middle income families are part of the analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance, which will provide a payment to parents at home with children, commences on 29 September 1994. It is effectively a $30 per week payment, the maximum payment being $60 a fortnight. Some important philosophical points need to be made about the home child-care allowance. The cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate sees the payment go directly to the carer of the child at home, which in the vast majority of cases is the mother, for the purposes of expenditure on the child. That is an important philosophical point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe that, having made a commitment in the course of the election campaign and having implemented that by way of legislation in the course of this parliamentary session, the government can look at either increasing that payment or making that payment available per child rather than per family. They are measures that we on this side should certainly look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During debate on this bill last night, I heard in passing those opposite making many criticisms of the home child-care allowance payment. As a result, I thought I might spend a bit of time quickly detailing some of its advantages. The first advantage is that it provides direct recognition of the time, energy, effort and personal support devoted to children by a parent, generally a mother, who decides to stay at home and raise children. For the first time, that support is provided directly to the parent caring for the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 840,000 families throughout Australia are expected to receive the home child-care allowance at any one time. That is the extent of this measure. This government provides assistance to 840,000 families, in addition to the $5 billion to $6 billion recurrent that we provide in a targeted way to families by way of the basic family payment and the additional family payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate and the topping up to $30 per week increases by $4 or $5 per fortnight the amount that families could expect to receive by way of the maximum dependent spouse rebate. The point needs to be made that not all families are entitled to the maximum amount of the dependent spouse rebate. So greater assistance is provided to those families who can take advantage of only part of the dependent spouse rebate but who are not entitled to take advantage of it to the maximum extent. It is estimated that approximately 50,000 to 55,000 families are not able to take advantage of the dependent spouse rebate to the maximum extent. However, they will now be able to take advantage of the home child-care allowance to its maximum amount of $30 per week or $60 per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An additional point needs to be made with respect to the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate. It is true to say that the home child-care payment is more responsive to families' needs than the dependent spouse rebate. The current income test on spouse income will be used rather than the financial year test which is used by way of the dependent spouse rebate. A parent leaving the work force at any time during the year to care for dependent children will be able to claim the allowance immediately instead of waiting to re-establish his or her entitlement at the end of the financial year by way of the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that that will have the effect of assisting 100,000 to 120,000 families whose circumstances change in any one year. So we have a more flexible regime; a regime that will ensure that nearly 850,000 families in Australia are assisted. About 55,000 families will be able to take the benefit of the payments to its maximum extent&mdash;a category of families which was not able to take advantage of the maximum dependent spouse rebate&mdash;and we will have over 100,000 families which will be able to take advantage of their changing circumstances to get the payment direct on a weekly basis rather than waiting for an end of financial year rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have concentrated on those two issues&mdash;regional headquarters, which reflects the government's commitment to economic growth, and the home child-care allowance. I now see that my Western Australian colleague the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) has just entered the chamber. I am pleased about that because finally I want to draw attention to those changes that I know the Assistant Treasurer has a strong commitment to&mdash;that is, the sales tax measures as they relate to child-care centres. He said in his second reading speech on this bill:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In late 1993, to make child care more affordable the government introduced amendments to provide certain exemptions from sales tax to child-care bodies. In general, to obtain funding for a child-care centre and thus access to the sales tax exemptions the centre must be outfitted and operating. This raises the issue that goods needed to set up the centre will not be exempted from sales tax. The bill will introduce a new credit ground to allow such bodies a credit of sales tax for goods to be used in the provision of child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to remind the Assistant Treasurer that I have put a view to him directly that this same provision ought to apply to toy libraries. I propose to put this to him again publicly when I make the opening speech at the toy libraries conference in Perth in the very near future. I am looking forward to a positive response from him on toy libraries and sales tax in the course of a not too distant financial year. </PARA>

It would be allowed at $1,188, which in net terms is $372 less than the amount that would be received if the person were fully eligible for the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose again to catalogue all the cases that the government's legislation has adversely affected, save to say that if members opposite are true to their rhetoric&mdash;that is, they are concerned about low and middle income earners and they are concerned to assist those most in need&mdash;they would obviously want to address the problems that have been identified. Very low income earners, who are clearly in need and who are presently able to benefit from the dependent spouse rebate and the way in which it is paid, will, under the arrangements, be ineligible for the home child-care allowance in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most pertinent case that most clearly needs to be remedied amongst all others relates to those who are eligible to receive the new partner allowance that the government is introducing. The partner of someone receiving a jobsearch payment would have received the wife's payment before and there would not have been any particular payments under the tax arrangements. In this situation, where the government is introducing the home child care allowance, if the partner of a person receiving the jobsearch allowance receives the partner's allowance, together they will be earning over the income limit and will not be able to receive the home child-care allowance payment. For people who earn rather modest additional sums through part-time work, where eligibility for a dependent spouse rebate might well have applied, the home child-care allowance will not now be payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find that an unconscionable position that needs to be addressed. The amendment that we propose will address the situation. If it is carried, it will ensure that those who fall through the cracks in the floor are able to continue to receive the dependent spouse rebate. It provides an option for people who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance under the special rules relating to testing income in the Social Security Act. These rules operate differently from the way in which income is dealt with under the tax act. It is a sensible amendment and one which the government ought to warm to and want to pick up willingly. </PARA>

<PARA>We have never tried to hide the fact that one form of payment would replace what was a tax deduction for, usually, the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast that with what the coalition government did in 1976. It cashed out the child tax rebate, which was an indexed payment, and combined it with child endowment, a small payment in the social security system which was not indexed, to create a new family payment called the family allowance. It was paid to the carer through the social security system. However, in a full year, there was no net cost from the new measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most one-child families and families in which all children were of school age were losers under the coalition system. Over time, because the family allowance was not indexed, it reduced in value considerably. The Liberal government actually saved money over time. It was estimated that, by 1980, it was saving about $250 million per year from not indexing it. By the end of the coalition government, the family allowance had fallen in real terms by at least 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast between this government and the Liberal government is that when the Liberal government made the change it cost the beneficiaries' 20 per cent in real terms. The value of their benefits went down by 20 per cent. In comparison, the government has put in an extra $230 million on top of the savings from the measures that have been announced in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance has some significant advantages over the current dependent spouse rebate. It provides more direct recognition of the considerable time, energy and personal support devoted to children by parents, generally by mothers who decide to stay at home to raise their children. For the first time, this support will be provided direct to the parent caring for the children rather than to the other partner as a tax concession. Approximately 840,000 families are expected to receive the home child-care allowance at any one time. It will be paid at a maximum rate of $60 a fortnight, nearly $5 a fortnight higher than the maximum rate of the dependent spouse rebate. Nearly 800,000 families are expected to receive increased payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 55,000 families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate available to couples with dependent children will receive up to $60 per fortnight extra. It will also be more responsive to families' needs than the dependent spouse rebate because there will be a current income test on a spouse's income rather than the financial year test, which is used for the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents leaving the work force at any time during the year to, say, care for dependent children will be able to claim the allowance immediately instead of having to wait to re-establish their entitlement in a new financial year. This flexibility is expected to assist up to 120,000 families whose circumstances change within any one year. These enhancements, as I have said before, will cost the government&mdash;in addition to the savings it will make in these measures&mdash;an extra $230 million; and they are indexed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the amendments moved by the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the government will not accept them. The main reason is that the amendments do not do the job properly. We will move our own amendments after we have drafted them carefully. We will move them in the Senate. They will pick up the benefits that I outlined in my second reading speech. A taxpayer whose spouse qualifies for the home child-care allowance will not be entitled to claim the without child dependent spouse rebate through the tax system under the bill as it presently stands. However, the government considers that families should be able to fall back on to the without child dependent spouse rebate if they qualify for that rebate. Accordingly, the government will be moving amendments to the bill in the Senate, which I have already foreshadowed, to allow taxpayers to claim the without child dependent spouse rebate instead of claiming for the home child-care allowance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) for his comments, and I am sure he would like to pick up some of these matters and perhaps respond more fully. Perhaps I will give him that opportunity so he can explain where the opposition's amendments fail to meet the task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantial difference between the approach the opposition wants to take and the one the government wants to take was brought out by the minister in his speech yesterday when he said that the government seeks to put those who would not qualify for the home child-care allowance in a situation where they would still be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate. He said they would be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate paid at the without child dependent spouse rebate rate, not the with child student dependent spouse rebate, which is the higher figure of $1,425 at this stage. That is set out clearly in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is involved in a degree of obfuscation. It is making it very clear that this is an expenditure saving exercise. It is wanting to reduce the overall cost by ensuring that there are some people who will not benefit from these arrangements who would previously have been eligible for a dependent spouse rebate paid at the with child student dependent rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the new benefit is payable involves an additional payment. It is a very modest payment because of the sleight of hand that has been involved. The government held out that it was a major new initiative: it was not; it was cashing out the dependent spouse rebate and topping it up a little, for some. But at the same time that the government tops it up for some, it cuts others out and, essentially, they are people on very low incomes&mdash;people who fall through the cracks in the floor. If government members were serious and really wanted to do the job properly, they would pick up the opposition's amendment or agree to look at the matter more closely in the Senate. But I very much regret that the Assistant Treasurer takes the view that the amendments he has foreshadowed and proposed will do the job when clearly, by his own words, they will not put people back in the same position that they were in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have identified before, a number of classes of people will be so affected. There are people whose eligibility for the home child-care allowance ceases when their youngest child turns 18 or leaves secondary school&mdash;whichever comes first; there are families in which the dependent child is a prescribed student and who is automatically excluded from the home child-care allowance; and there are people who are absent from Australia for periods exceeding 13 weeks. As I indicated, this could include overseas aid workers, exchange students and academics taking overseas appointments&mdash;those who continue to pay tax in Australia and would have been eligible for a dependent spouse rebate but will fail in relation to this particular measure. I think that the government ought to take this matter up in a serious way because it is a very serious amendment that the opposition is proposing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the Assistant Treasurer's comments about the way in which the old family allowance arrangements were implemented, so I had a look at the debates on this subject. I would have thought that, if the government were seriously suggesting that the allowance arrangements fell short, there would have been some substantial criticism by the opposition&mdash;as it then was&mdash;of the government's proposals at that time. In the debate which took place on 26 May 1976 Mr Hayden, who was dealing with the matter, said that the new measures constituted a very good principle; the opposition supported it. Gordon Scholes, who spoke in the same debate, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think anyone disputes the value of the changes in the child endowment and dependants' allowances area. I certainly do not. The changes that have been made in the means of distributing funds in this area are to the advantage of the large families on low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>The only person who, in his usual, rather esoteric way, picked up some of these points and ran them in adjournment debates was the honourable member for Prospect, Dick Klugman. But he was not supported by the then opposition which, if it had been serious about mounting that sort of criticism and had been concerned about low income earners who were going to lose, would have been proposing some amendments like we are today in relation to that legislation. It certainly did not do so. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We have said to the government&mdash;more clearly than anybody could do, usually&mdash;`Here is an alternative formulation which you could adopt which we believe will do the job.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of our amendment to this clause is to try to restore some consistency in the tax treatment of remanufactured goods sold in Australia to tax exempt users. The amendment to clause 128 which we are moving is to the effect that we want to provide for sales tax credits in respect of parts used in remanufacturing goods used by or leased to exempt users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current sales tax treatment of parts used in the local remanufacture and repair of goods is a clear disincentive to the remanufacturing and repairing industry. I made this point very clearly in my initial speech during the second reading debate. I do not want to go into any great detail on that except to make the point that once again there is a fundamental inconsistency in the government's present position. On the one hand it wants to give tax deductibility to sales of remanufactured goods made overseas&mdash;as I said, we strongly support that view&mdash;but on the other hand it is not prepared to offer tax deductibility, as it had previously done under the old act, to exempt bodies, including the three levels of government, involved in the purchase of remanufactured or repaired goods in Australia. In other words, no satisfactory explanation has been offered as to why under the old act this exemption was provided but under the new act it is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is even further complicated by the diverse views one receives from none other than the tax office. The  tax office position seems to have been from my discussions with it that it ought to be there, that a mistake was made,  that this clause was not included in the act and that it should be rectified. However, on further discussion it appears that there are two essential issues which the government is concerned about: firstly, the question of the passing on of the provision&mdash;in other words, who is the ultimate beneficiary&mdash;and, secondly, the question of so-called loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passing on of the provision is an important question. I would not resile from that for one moment. Clearly we must have a rebate system which ensures that the end user gets the benefit of the tax not being applied. I have had the advantage in this particular situation of visiting the industry and seeing how the remanufacturing process works. I am quite convinced on the basis of what I saw and what I was told that there is no technical problem in ensuring that you have in place a system by which it is possible to audit effectively those components in remanufactured goods on which a tax deduction would be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take, for example, Rank Xerox, which manufactures a range of very effective copying equipment. If a piece of copying equipment comes in to be remanufactured, it is examined in detail, it is literally pulled apart, parts are replaced, a document is attached to the chassis, to the outer skin of the equipment, which identifies the number of item, the classification of the item and the number and the value of the items included in the remanufacturing process. That immediately gives the purchaser the basic information necessary upon which to lodge a subsequent claim. If it is believed, for example, that the company itself is the beneficiary and not the end user, that can be easily identified because the company has to put in a claim for the amount of equipment it uses for which it is claiming the deduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no technical reason why this could not be in place. It was in place for many years. The onus is clearly on the government and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) to explain to the House in clear, concise language which the industry will understand why it is that on the one hand the government is now putting in place a fundamental inconsistency in the tax provision while on the other hand it is asking industry to develop an export orientated remanufacturing base. The government knows perfectly well that the economies of scale within the industry require that we have a capacity to sell domestically as well as in the foreign market. The wider and deeper we are able to achieve that economy of scale, the more effective industry we will create, the more jobs we will create, the greater revenue we will attract and all the other benefits that flow from that. That is not the position of the government. Therefore I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). The main reason for our opposition is that the amendment would, in the government's view, add severe complexity to the law without providing a corresponding economic benefit. The reason for the existing sales tax credit scheme is to alleviate double taxation where goods are used as an input in the production of other goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not include goods purchased for the purpose of providing, for example, government services. The provisions in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) that provide relief for export goods are clearly distinguishable. There are no worries about that. The government is trying to encourage and promote Australian exporters and their competitiveness overseas. The bill achieves that aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has concerns with the honourable member's amendment which effectively seeks to ensure that any credit is passed on to the end user. If we give this benefit to Xerox, which was one example mentioned, there is no way of knowing that the person who buys equipment will benefit from the proposed changes under the honourable member's amendment. It is for those reasons that the government opposes the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 with new legislation to enable plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they develop. Essentially the Breeder's Rights Bill, the PBR bill, falls within the scope of public policy established over 15 years from 1971 to 1986 by extensive public inquiry that included an exhaustive inquiry in 1986 by the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources. That Senate standing committee in 1986 recommended, among other things, that a plant variety rights scheme be established, that legislation be drafted to conform with the 1978 convention of the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants, known as UPOV, and that Australia accede to the 1978 UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBR bill 1994 was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and a public hearing and further submissions were considered. The standing committee is of the view that the bill is not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The aim of rewriting and renaming the legislation is principally to conform to the 1991 revision of the UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate standing committee, in its report, also endorsed the policy framework underpinning the bill that will allow Australia to ratify the 1991 UPOV convention. PBR legislation conforming to the 1991 UPOV convention is expected to provide a greater stimulus than the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 to innovation by encouraging increased investment in plant breeding and technology transfer. Continued innovation is needed to maintain Australia's competitiveness in agricultural and horticultural industries and the stimulation of technology transfer is crucial to maintaining Australia's access to new plant varieties for all plant industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These aims will be more easily achieved if Australia harmonises its legislation and accedes to the 1991 UPOV convention because other member countries of UPOV are preparing to do so and amending their legislation. The legislation, when harmonised with that of other member countries under the 1991 UPOV convention, from which some reciprocal rights are possible, is also expected to provide a stimulus to the seed export trade. The opportunity was also taken whilst the new bill was in preparation to introduce other provisions that would further increase the efficiency of the plant variety rights scheme, the PVR scheme, and the effectiveness of varietal protection without going beyond the limits of the 1991 UPOV convention or compromising the public interest provisions of the Plant Variety Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain English used in the PBR bill should promote a better understanding of, and a wider interest in, the legislation on which the plant breeders rights scheme will be based. The change in the name of the legislation to plant breeder's rights brings it into line with the new UPOV convention and common usage internationally for this form of intellectual property protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unit administering the legislation and the scheme will be renamed the Plant Breeder's Rights Office. The Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 will be repealed following the successful passage and proclamation of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. Transitional arrangements to the new legislation will be convenient and simple to implement. All of the approximately 1000 applications that have been made for plant variety rights in the five years since the commencement of the scheme will be either deemed to have been granted PBR or, should they be in the process of being examined on the day of proclamation, they will continue to be examined under the old act and, if successful, they will be granted PBR. No grantee of PVR under the old act will be disadvantaged by the transition arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important changes to the legislation in the PBR bill have been developed in consultation with the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, and these changes have their support. I note in this regard the efforts made by the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of grain growers to find solutions, using PBR legislation, to stimulate investment in breeding our principal grain crops, which that industry knows is an important element in maintaining our international trading competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PBR bill provides for increased scope and effectiveness of the breeder's right on protected varieties. It is envisaged that, in the national interest, all sectors of the agricultural and horticultural industries, including public and private plant breeders, will jointly use the strategic business assets that PBR provides to develop marketing and breeder royalty systems appropriate to their industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plant breeders' rights scheme is complementary to the government's policies geared to promote innovation in Australia's plant industries by encouraging research and development using production levies and tax concessions. In addition, the PBR bill is consistent with Australia's obligations under the UPOV convention and the TRIPS agreement of GATT and with the FAO `undertaking on plant genetic resources'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to advice from the Attorney-General's Department, the bill is not in conflict with either the International Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity or native title legislation. In response to the Senate standing committee's report, government has also introduced additional public safeguards to tabling of regulations on farm-saved seed and the duration of PBR. In this regard, if the minister is considering making regulations there will be mandatory public notice, a 30-day public consultation period and a requirement for the PBR advisory committee to take into account public submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to reassure the House that all the public interest features of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 have been retained, and even extended, in the PBR bill and thus the essential balance between the public interest and the extended breeder's right has been maintained. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We in the coalition are pleased to support this important approach. As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) said, the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill amounts to little more than an updating of the plant variety rights legislation which has operated in Australia since 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current bill was subject to a Senate inquiry which recommended some amendments to provide for more public involvement. These amendments were agreed to by the government and the coalition. They have been passed in the Senate, and we are happy to oblige in this place now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does seem that the Australian Conservation Foundation, which is normally pretty objective and factual in its publications, has caused a certain amount of unnecessary concern by undertaking a campaign which has been a little off the mark in relation to its presentation of the facts in this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign seems to have emanated from one individual in particular who is paid not from Australian Conservation Foundation funds but by Australian taxpayers through a federal government grant to encourage debate on genetic engineering. If this campaign, which I believe has been misleading, is a sample of his work, the government should have a close look at whether he is the most appropriate person to encourage genuine debate in the genetic engineering area and whether funding should continue to flow in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plant breeders' rights were discussed extensively in this country between 1981 and 1986, concluding with an exhaustive inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources. That committee recommended that a plant variety rights scheme be established in line with the 1987 Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, or UPOV, and that Australia accede to that convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the 1987 legislation, Australia had not been able to keep up with the latest varieties in a host of areas, particularly in horticulture. This was because breeders' rights were not adequately protected in Australia and people who had bred new varieties were reluctant to allow their varieties to be accessed in this country for fear that they would essentially lose what amounted to their property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has outlined, the reason for rewriting and renaming the legislation is to ensure that it conforms with the 1991 revision of the UPOV convention. The new legislation is expected to provide a greater stimulus to innovation than did the earlier 1987 act by encouraging increased investment in plant breeding and technology transfer. Therefore, in my view, concern about its leading to fewer new plant varieties is, to put it mildly, unfounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes it easier for farmers to save seed. Clause 17 of the bill allows farmers to save seed as a matter of right. I am aware of two areas&mdash;they were opposed to the bill, because I do not think they understood it&mdash;which were active and which published material claiming that farmers would be disadvantaged by this measure. I have received many letters from these areas saying that farmers' right to save seed was somehow threatened by this legislation. I am sorry that that misunderstanding has arisen. I sincerely hope that, through our response, our letters to editors and our direct response to individual letters and media articles, those fears have been well and truly allayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the Senate standing committee's report, the government has introduced additional public safeguards to tabling of regulations on farm-saved seed and the duration of plant breeders' rights. While it will be possible for an industry&mdash;not an individual or a company&mdash;to seek exemptions from farm-saved seed under clause 17(2) of the bill, no industry has sought such an exemption. It needs to be recognised that no industry in the future will request an exemption from the saved seed provisions unless it is quite sure that there is more profit for the individuals in that industry in buying new seed rather than saving it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am aware, the cotton industry, which is overwhelmingly concentrated in my electorate, is the only one that has indicated that, at some stage in the future, it might like to seek alterations to this provision as it relates to that industry. If the minister is considering making regulations at the request of an industry, I note that there will be mandatory public notice, a 30-day public consultation period and a requirement for the PBR advisory committee to take into account any public submissions before action can be taken. That is an adequate safeguard. I have no problems with it at all. In fact, I welcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform those farmers who have expressed concern that the farmer organisations have been involved. The Grains Council, in particular, made a strong submission to the Senate inquiry, expressing growers' support for the legislation. I again emphasise that no farmer organisation has advised me of any opposition on its part to the legislation. I again note that the important changes to the legislation in the PBR bill have been developed in consultation with the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia. The changes have the support of those organisations for very good reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best way to encourage further developments in plant technology&mdash;better yields, more disease resistance, more insect resistance, or whatever&mdash;is to ensure that those people who are prepared to risk capital and finance in developing those new genetic and other technologies are guaranteed of a financial return, or at least to minimise the possibility of financial loss. In my view, Australia will remain fully competitive only if those safeguards are properly put in place. In the long term, it is only with those sorts of guarantees that the globe will continue to be able to feed itself and provide for its hungry mouths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had many letters from farmer organisations, the nursery association and other horticultural organisations urging the coalition to pass this bill without delay. Therefore, the bill has our support, as do the amendments suggested by the Senate inquiry and carried by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 proposes to repeal the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The Plant Variety Rights Act was enacted to grant a proprietary right to any breeder of a new variety of certain plants and granting them exclusive rights to sell or license others to sell plants or seeds that they have developed. The act requires that plants and reproductive material be readily available to meet public demand at reasonable prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 November 1986 when the act was presented to this House in bill form, I expressed my concerns about the proposed legislation by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major arguments against PVR concern their effects on the lesser developed countries and the genetic stock, which is what interests me. It is argued that the system of PVR adversely affects the lesser developed countries as they will become more reliant on seed stock that has to be imported from the more developed countries. If they refuse to pay, they will be deprived of the more productive crops. The concern over genetic stock is that the range available for future use will be drastically reduced and will get into fewer and fewer hands, and that much of the genetic stock that has been developed by nature will cease to be available.</PARA>
<PARA>I also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps there should even be a sunset clause in the whole Bill so that in 20 or 30 years time we can look at it and, if it is not working correctly, take steps to correct it. I hope there is a large seed stock that can be distributed freely throughout the country and we will not have to rely on one particular company or its products to enable us to survive.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were the views I had then and my views have not changed. I still believe there are long-term dangers in this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I then acknowledged the benefits of plant variety rights, such as encouragement of increased plant breeding and the resulting export opportunities, I expressed my concern about the impact on developing countries. In order for the lesser developed countries to become more self-subsistent and their economies to become stronger, they need to be developing their own local products for their own local consumption. They do not need to be at the mercy of the large multinational companies, which swallow many plant variety rights and then export the manufactured product to struggling countries at exorbitant prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also expressed my concern that the growth of the manufactured plant and seed industry will have a detrimental effect on the availability of naturally grown stock. By way of illustration of this concern, I referred to the fact that at the turn of the century there were approximately 30,000 varieties of rice in India. Now, however, there are only 30 varieties in use. Much of the genetic stock has been stored for future use, which begs the question: if the seeds created by nature are being hidden away for future use, who controls access to these seeds and on what terms and conditions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is designed to repeal the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 but to save the effect of many of the provisions in the repealed act and also to increase, extend and effect a number of those provisions. The bill proposes to increase the length of time for which a plant breeder's rights can be granted; extend the coverage of a plant breeder's rights to include the import and export of propagated material; and extend the coverage of a plant breeder's rights, including essentially derived and certain dependent varieties and in certain circumstances harvested material. It also increases the penalties for breaches of a plant breeder's rights. The effect of the provisions in this bill is to heighten the concerns which I previously expressed. Others share my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a submission on this bill Friends of the Earth suggested that patenting rights to plants favour economic growth over possible ends and takes genetic material out of its historical and cultural context. The submission also suggests that most material protected by patenting is owned by companies from the northern industrialised countries despite the fact that much of the plant material that created this resource originated in southern Third World countries. These northern companies are in fact stealing resources from these other countries. Honourable members will recall that I have previously expressed my concern that large multinationals export manufactured plants and seeds to developing countries at exorbitant prices. Friends of the Earth is suggesting that these manufactured plants and seeds derive from resources which originated in the developing countries in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment I am reading a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seizing the future</EMPHASIS> by Michael Zey. It talks about American companies involved in genetic engineering&mdash;that is, altering existing plants and then patenting them. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for agricultural biotechnology is impressive. Already on the line is a highly productive corn that grows without fertiliser. Reports have also become public of a marsh grass that cheaply desalinates seawater, changing it to drinking water needed by growing populations.</PARA>
<PARA>Imagine what the companies will do once they get hold of this particular plant: they will patent it and then sell it back, as I said before, at exorbitant prices. The passage continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than a dozen companies have developed at least 70 new crops by utilising innovations in genetic engineering. A wide variety of cantaloupes, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers and cucumbers that contain new proteins, enzymes and other substances that make them superior in several different ways. Grains that resist the effect of drought. Such crops may have further uses in space colonies or other areas that have little or no access to water. Cotton and other products that are immune to infestation by insects.</PARA>
<PARA>For many companies the 1990s is the biotech decade. Among those planning to introduce genetically improved tomatoes which extend shelf life are Calgene and Monsanto. The latter company, along with Frito Lay, is also involved with developing a modified starched potato which resists starch. Many companies including Monsanto, Upjohn, American Cyanamid and Eli Lilly are developing a cow growth hormone to boost milk production. These are some of the biggest, wealthiest and most powerful companies in the world. They employ many people involved in long-term strategy. I am certain that they are not just investing millions in this area unless they are going to get back billions in profit further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the types of companies which can influence governments, legislators and legislation. They have similar powers, of course, to the oil companies; and this worries me. If anything goes wrong, they will threaten you with the contempt one reads about in today's newspapers, of how the American giant multinational Dow Corning is treating Australian women at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, to which this bill was referred for consideration, the United Scientists for Environmental Responsibility and Protection (South Australia) expressed its concern that there is no guarantee in the bill that farmers will be able to save seed of PBR protected variety to sow crops in subsequent seasons. Farmers have the right under this legislation to be able to save the seed. However, with the newer variety of hybrids, their particular seed will not be able to be saved and used again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concern raised by the united scientists relates to my wider concern that the producer is coming under increasing pressure from the owners of plant breeders rights in regard to what they can and cannot produce. As the stock of plant seeds covered by breeders rights expands, the freedom of the farmer or the backyard gardener to grow natural products will decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech on this matter in 1986 I held up six packets of cabbage seeds and noted that only one of them was not a hybrid. I went back to a seed shop to buy similar seeds and I could not find any. One of the things I did notice was that the word `hybrid' does not appear on packets of seeds now. This might have been just in the particular shop I went to. Maybe it is just my cynical mind thinking that these companies that produce seeds have actually taken the word `hybrid' off the packets. If we buy the seeds and plant them, we grow a good crop the first year, but the second year we get nothing. I will research further why this word `hybrid' has been taken off the packets of seeds. As I said, maybe it was just in the particular shop I went to. I will do a lot more work on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that, as a general principle, family farms which struggle to survive are losing their natural right to store seed for future seasons because large multinationals do not think it is a national right; rather, they think it is an entitlement bestowed by the multinationals themselves. The noose on seed supply is tightening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me put to honourable members this hypothetical scenario. It is the year 2010. People buy their seed for an antidrought, antidisease top crop from that great farming firm Monsanto, which in the past brought us some helpful chemicals such as 2, 4, 5-T. They pay top dollar for it. They get a great crop the first year. They save enough seed from this crop to plant the second crop the next year. Of course, up it comes&mdash;another great crop. The third year, when they use this seed, or what is left of it, what do they get? No seed. An ecological time bomb is built into this seed. They are on their knees for a new batch of seed because nothing else is available. The company has them. This may seem a little far-fetched, but banks have been using this business practice for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have read with interest the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. I have some sympathy with the concerns about the application of industrial property rights to living matter which were expressed by the Australian Conservation Foundation and Greenpeace. I agree with Senator Woodley's position, set out in his minority report, that the privatisation of living organisms is morally objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plant and animal genes are being patented. What right do we have to patent nature? Who gives us the right to patent something that we had nothing to do with? It is not an invention. We did not take two chemicals, put them together and make a seed. That stock was there. All we are doing is adding a little here and chopping at the edges and then saying that it belongs to us. An invention which comes out of my head from an idea I had is new. If I build it, I have something physical that I know has come from an original idea in my head. This type of legislation steals and modifies an idea of which nature is the originator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an issue, plant variety rights have been with us since the early 1960s. Since that time, not only has there been much discussion; there has been much activity. For example, any nurseryman will tell us that it is only in the years following the 1987 legislation that Australian nurserymen have been able to develop new and improved strains of plants and seeds, better methods of production and distribution, and an export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I must mention my daughter, Jane, who has just started an apprenticeship in this industry. I trust that this subject will be well discussed during her schooling and her apprenticeship. This line of argument about the fact that everything has improved since 1987 was put to the Senate standing committee by the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Australian Nursery Industry Association. I appreciate and understand this line of argument, but it is not strong enough to overcome my general concerns about the ideology of patenting rights to nature's products. I also understand that one person's concerns are of little significance in the wider debate about the power and influence exerted on the global economy by the large multinational companies. However, one can never tell. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original bill was called the Plant Variety Rights Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise the honourable member and those who may read these speeches that the process of hybridisation is a crossbreed process of bringing together two varieties, crosspollinating and then planting the progeny, or the seeds, of that crossbreeding program. I think most students in second- or third-year high school would have come across Mendel's law regarding what happens if the product of that hybrid plant is replanted. There is a reversion in one part to one original parent and in another part to the other parent, and then there are two continuing hybrid types. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is completely inaccurate for the honourable member to say that there is nothing in the third year. There is a crop. It is better than the two separate parent crops that were used originally. The purpose of hybridisation is to maintain the original parent stock. It is critical in any plant breeding program&mdash;or any program&mdash;to retain the pool of genetic diversities. Every breeder of plants or animals wants a complete diversity of material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fears have been expressed about the availability of specific crops to only one individual, with the rest of the world going without, and about some multinational company being able to corner the market to the detriment of the rest of the world. These situations are an impossibility. If people want the very best of a specific type for a commercial crop, the breeder of that crop will receive some payment and his or her rights will be protected for the work that he or she has put into it. But it is part of the process that, as the government's own legislation says, there must be effective testing to prove whether or not what is being advanced as a unique type of crop or seed actually is unique and different from the existing ones. So there is extensive testing. Then there must be ready availability. All those facts are covered in the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time that Australia recognised the reality of what is happening to our unique plant species. Our genetic pool of plants has been raided. International raiders have come in and taken our plant species offshore. They have genetically manipulated those plants and produced crops worth millions of dollars in value for their nations. Australia has been excluded from this process because there is no protection for a plant breeder and no encouragement for a plant breeder to look at the prospect of developing something unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is the Geraldton wax, a common Australian plant. It was taken by the Israelis and developed to a very fine degree by both selection and genetic manipulation to produce a crop that has wide attraction across the Northern Hemisphere. Only since we have had plant variety rights in Australia have Australian breeders been allowed to touch this material, know that it will be protected and know that their work will ultimately be worth something at the end of the day. I pay tribute to a dear friend, Mr Nick Derera, who is one of Australia's great plant breeders in both wheat and cotton. He has worked for the New South Wales and Australian governments over many years. He is now retired and living in my electorate. He was recognised in recent Australian awards for his contribution to Australia's economic success and the success of our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this point, Geraldton wax has been bred only by  foreigners. Although it is a native Australian plant, the Australian capacity to use this plant material was denied until we had plant variety rights or breeders rights. In the last few years, Mr Derera has taken the Geraldton wax, miniaturised it and crowded blossoms onto it. He has not destroyed&mdash;he did not want to&mdash;the original plant material; it can still be found in the bush. He is a scientist who wants to retain the diversity of the genetic pool that he needs to be able to go on with his work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Derera has taken one part of the genetic pool in Geraldton wax and created a miniature flowering Christmas tree. When it sits on a table, it measures somewhere between six and 18 inches high. It is a beautiful table decoration. In just its first year of miniature production, that one plant earned $3 million for Australian exporters. This plant is being applauded across the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in the United States. Where do the rights to it belong? In Australia. There is a long sad story of Australian scientists and plant breeders being done over by the pirates of this world taking our material to their own shores and calling it their native product. So it is time that we had legislation like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I remember correctly, this was firstly an initiative of the Fraser government. It was then delayed by arguments similar to those just used by the honourable member for Dunkley. They are unnecessary. The fears expressed at that time and since have not been realised. We now have Australians who are the best in the world. They have an opportunity to show what we can do and to provide for the rest of the world and Australian producers and farmers the sorts of opportunities that we should have had long before they were given to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have given one simple instance. I can think of hundreds of similar occurrences in the late Professor Keith Campbell's work with waratahs. This issue is about breeding a plant and not destroying the original material, which is critical. It is like a basic investment in the bank. No responsible scientists would dare touch it or want to change it. Doing so would restrict their opportunities for the future. Keith Campbell took the waratah and produced multiheaded plants. Beautiful cut flower decorations are now able to be exported by Australians and used around the world for the first time. </PARA>

I know that, of 10,000 varieties of peach tree trialled in New South Wales five years ago, four came through with some prospect of success. Of that 10,000, only one variety may have some commercial value.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), in his contribution in this debate, followed the usual conservative line that, if there is a philosophy involved, the coalition does not want to know about it. It wants the dollar and the profit. He completely threw away any arguments, based on philosophical notions, that the ownership of genetic material is wrong per se. It is not of interest to him that private companies can own genetic material and use it for profit only without looking at the broader issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have a broader view. We do not necessarily say that, whilst this bill is necessary, one should not look at the broader philosophical issues which it involves. The way that we on this side of the House always approach these difficult issues discloses a fundamental difference between us and the profit greed of the conservatives of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw attention to the remarks of the honourable member for Mitchell, who is not in the House at the moment, when he said that Australia was missing out because we did not have plant variety rights. He does not seem to understand that wheat varieties in Australia, for example, were adapted by CSIRO for many years, including rust resistant varieties, long before plant variety legislation became a reality. In fact, Australian cropping and Australian wheat variety has led the world in dry-style cropping. It is another sign of ignorance from those on the other side to suggest that, without this sort of legislation, Australia was not developing new varieties of genetic material which were benefiting Australian farmers and, indeed, making us a very profitable exporting country in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be said at the outset that whilst I support this legislation I do have concerns about it. I supported the legislation in its previous form, as I will support this amending or changing legislation. But why are we doing it? Why does Australia need to give private ownership of genetic material? The answer is very simple: we are forced into it by events over which we have no control that have occurred overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As usual, it occurs in countries like the United States where new genetic breeding was followed by the demand by those who were successful in creating new plant varieties that ownership of those varieties be given to them, for profit motivation. Countries like Australia, which did not follow this regime of plant variety rights&mdash;if you like, copyright of genetic change&mdash;found themselves out of the marketplace where, for commercial purposes, they could not access new varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that most people do not necessarily, in philosophical terms, like the concept that genetic material can be owned, whether it be changed or not. But the reality is that, like it or not, unless Australia follows the path of other industrialised countries, our ability to compete in world markets with the new varieties available will be severely diminished and our horticulturalists and farmers generally in cropping areas will not compete on equal terms with overseas countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be looked at in that context. I do not think many people anywhere who think seriously about the problems of the world at large&mdash;population growth and the provision of food that the world so desperately needs for Third World countries&mdash;are keen on the idea of individuals owning such important material. I do not think any of us really think this is necessarily what we would like to see in a perfect world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do know that the world's population, exponentially, is exploding. We do know that in the next 20 years the world's population will double. Whilst the club of Rome got it wrong, and while Malthus in his original proposition was not quite accurate either, we now unarguably know that, unless something is done either to improve dramatically the capacity to feed the exploding populations of the world or to reduce the explosion of population, the future is indeed grim for countless billions of human beings on this planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where my concern for this concept of ownership of genetic material comes. Who is going to guarantee that those who hold genes for profit are necessarily going to provide the new varieties, in terms of increasing food capacity, to those who cannot afford to pay for it? In this legislation, the owner of a new variety of rice which, for example, could double the crop, reduce the growing time and therefore enable an increased number of crops in a growing season per field is under no obligation to provide it to a Third World country desperate to feed its expanding populations. It is pay up or do not get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If members in this House have the view that it is okay and that we should not be concerned about it, we as a parliament should be alarmed. The matter has to be debated. It is a matter which I believe should cause great concern not just to members of this House but to everyone, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and Greenpeace. I must confess that I do not particularly agree with Greenpeace's politics most of the time&mdash;that is because it is a privately owned, profit making organisation; I would much rather back the Australian Conservation Foundation&mdash;but those people who have argued very strongly on philosophical terms that genetic material should not be owned have a legitimate argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the balance with government is to somehow recognise the very simple fact that overseas countries now have this legislation, that owners of new material are denying those horticultural products in particular to Australian producers and that, unless we give the owners the copyright protection they demand, we will not get access to that material. That is the dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed my colleague the member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) in his contribution to this House reluctantly came to that conclusion also. Whilst he does not like the legislation, and whilst I do not have particular affinity for the philosophical concept, it is nevertheless the right thing for this parliament to do and it is the right thing for this government to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the original arguments back in 1986 when the first legislation went through this House I was approached by a large number of farmers from my electorate. For those who do not know Mansfield, Yarck and Molesworth in Victoria, in the Goulburn Valley, the area produces large amounts of pasture seed. Paspalum and rye grasses and clovers are very important for the pastoral industry of Australia, and many farmers there produce an enormous quantity of certified seed both for Australian use and for export. I had a large number of meetings with those producers and was quite alarmed to find that there were new pasture variety seeds developed externally to Australia which New Zealand had access to because in that period it had passed complementary legislation giving copyright ownership to such material and we in Australia had not. That meant that our seed producers were losing export markets. I stress again that these</PARA>
<PARA>are large producers; they are a multimillion dollar export business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early stages of discussions with the farmers, it became apparent to me that, like it or lump it, this legislation was necessary. Further down the track I became chairman of the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust, which is the major wholesale clearing house for horticultural products in Victoria and Queensland. Through CAD and other industry organisations, I had a fair degree of involvement with the Victorian horticultural industry. It became quite apparent that new varieties of apples&mdash;trained along trellises like grapes and which have much larger yields, require less water and produce larger volumes of apples than the old varieties&mdash;were not available in Australia unless we had legislation which protected the rights of the overseas owners of those varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became very apparent&mdash;particularly in the apple, stone fruit and citrus industries&mdash;that unless we gave a degree of protection through this type of legislation our Australian horticultural producers would not be able to compete effectively on world markets. Indeed, Australia could well have faced a situation where cheaper horticultural products could have been imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worry about that. I am a bit of a protectionist, as many members of this House know, and I sometimes wonder why we allow some of the imports to flood into this country when we can produce so well in this country. The level playing field is in the eyes of the econometrists and those who play with little computers; it does not really exist in the real world of commerce. Nevertheless, that was the criteria I adopted. Indeed, I moved and supported the original Plant Variety Rights Bill in 1986 in the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have been through a major inquiry involving the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, and I commend its report to anyone who is interested in this particular matter. As members of that committee rightly point out, the concept of plant variety rights is really an extension of the copyright principle. But they are different in a sense from patent rights in that the right conferred on the end product is not conferred on the process, so the process of genetic change cannot be owned; only the end product which has been produced as a result of that process can be owned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst pragmatically I am in favour of the legislation, I still wonder where the Third World is going to get the benefit, and I indicated that to the House earlier. I believe that the United Nations is going to have to address this matter very seriously. I know that there is a UN convention in existence which covers this area but, again, the UN convention is not going to guarantee in any way, shape or form access to these new varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on balance and having debated this once before in previous legislation, this bill has my full support. I welcome the changes from the original legislation; I believe they will strengthen the act. I know that the farmers whom I represent and the horticultural industries&mdash;which I have a great deal to do with&mdash;are looking forward to it. To those who oppose it, I think their philosophy is right, but they do not have to govern. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to support the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. The bill proposes to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987.

Specifically, the major differences are: an increase in the duration of PBR; an extension of PBR to include the import and export of propagative material; an extension of PBR to include in certain circumstances harvested material; an extension of PBR to include essentially derived and certain dependent varieties; and increased penalties for breaches of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intense public debate over the best part of 20 years preceded the proclamation on 1 May 1987 of the Plant Variety Rights Act, which is the forerunner to the bill now before the House. It is my intention to give some background on the history of plant variety rights&mdash;PVR&mdash;or plant breeders rights in Australia, together with an assessment of the impacts of PVR on the horticultural and agricultural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Covenant for the Protection of New Variety of Plants&mdash;UPOV&mdash;was signed in Europe over 32 years ago. Whereas some countries&mdash;such as the United Kingdom in 1964, the US in 1970 and New Zealand in 1973&mdash;moved to enact PVR enabling legislation relatively early after this signing, Australia was quite slow to act. In fact, it was not until 1977 that the Commonwealth was even able to come to the conclusion that it had adequate powers to operate PVR under the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the start, PVR was a controversial concept in Australia. For example, those few farmers who knew early on about the PVR proposal were very confused about it, even though seed producing and other horticultural industries were very supportive of the principle of PVR. As well, as most of Australia's plant breeders were in the public sector, there was a good deal of opposition stemming from the breeders' fear of private sector competition. It was said that the public sector plant breeding to a large extent concentrated on cereals and would be starved of funds as governments relied more and more on PVR incentives to encourage private breeding. It was felt that the private industry would be seeking only immediate profits and would not be able to do the long-term strategic research through which CSIRO and the state institutions had proved their usefulness. There was certainly no consensus among state and federal departments on the worth of PVR in the late 1970s and early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the most vociferous opposition came in 1979 from the many supporters of the newly published Canadian book by P.R. Mooney, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seeds of the Earth: a private or public resource?</EMPHASIS> This book denigrated PVR as a scourge of genetic source material in underdeveloped countries. Some conservation and consumer groups then elaborated on PVR as a tool of large multinational petrochemical countries. These, it was alleged, were scheming to control the world's genetic resources for food production in order to make farmers dependent on petrochemical derived pesticides and fertilisers. Some takeovers of seed companies by multinationals at the time only heightened many people's fear of the global conspiracy generated by Mooney's book. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, the coalition government of the day was not making things easy with its inadequate legislation. A particular point of contention was the scope of plants to be covered by PVR. Whereas a draft bill for PVR had been drawn up as early as May 1979, it was not until 7 May 1991 that the Plant Variety Rights Bill reached the House of Representatives. Following numerous amendments, a version of the bill passed the House on party lines on 21 April 1982. Opposition members of the day&mdash;I was one of them&mdash;argued that all the implications of PVR had not been considered by the government and that the bill should be referred to a select committee of the House of Representatives. This was not done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Senate referred the bill to its Standing Committee on National Resources on 15 September 1982. The committee's report of May 1984 reaffirmed serious deficiencies in the 1982 bill but gave the go ahead for further consideration of PVR. In July 1985, the Labor government commissioned Professor Lazenby to conduct a Commonwealth inquiry into Australia's plant breeding needs in order to investigate the frequently supported detrimental effect of PVR on public sector plant breeding programs. The inquiry came out strongly in support of PVR and upheld the desirability of Australia joining UPOV. The then federal Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Kerin, introduced a much improved plant variety rights bill on 8 October 1986, which passed both Houses by 25 February 1987. It had taken all of eight years for satisfactory PVR legislation to be proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the House considers a replacement bill for the 1987 act in view of the UPOV update of 1991, and in light of the operational experience of the PVR system since 1987, one is entitled to ask: which, if any, of the furious arguments of a decade ago have proved correct with time? To briefly review the pros and cons of PVR expressed over a number of years, PVR promised to encourage private plant breeding in Australia, which had been largely confined to hybrids. At the same time, the importation of improved foreign plant varieties would for the first time be enabled, since they would be afforded copyright protection following Australia's membership of UPOV. Opponents argued that PVR would suppress public sector plant breeding and would concentrate ownership of the world's food plant genes in the hands of a few large multinationals. Debate on the original Plant Variety Rights Bill was confused by the lack of good studies of the impact of PVR overseas&mdash;studies which could have confirmed or denied the above claims. Likewise, in Australia there had been few extensive inquiries on PVR's effects since 1987. One exception is an evaluation of the plant variety rights scheme carried out by A.S. Watson for the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy early in 1983. This review is now briefly summarised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of general issues surrounding PVR, the review noted that the controversy over plant breeders rights pertaining to field crops was always more intense than the case for ornamentals, fruits and vegetables. The latter group of plants seems to have been quite well served by PVR, for example, in bringing new varieties from overseas. In Australia, product cycles are usually shorter&mdash;with the exception of fruit and ornamental trees&mdash;and customers make a direct comparison of varieties in nurseries with field crop variety selection and use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain firms and certain horticultural species, such as roses, have found PVR particularly useful. The predominance of PVRs granted for horticultural species is demonstrated by the fact that, up to September 1992, 82 per cent of PVR applications have fallen into that category. Ornamentals have been the most popular subcategory, with 65 per cent of total applications. Pasture species and crop species have each made up nine per cent of total applications. Another established pattern is the strong leaning to vegetatively propagated varieties, which accounted for 80 per cent up to 1992 as compared with seed varieties, which accounted for 20 per cent of total applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that both the expectations for, and fears over, PVR in the agricultural or field crop sphere have largely been unrealised. Overall the review concluded that `PVR has only a small role to play for broadacre industries'. The fact that PVR permits the use of farm saved seed means that there is only a limited economic incentive to pursue PVR in this area. Furthermore, the consultant felt that this exemption from PVR was reasonable and sensible under the circumstances. Repeated use of farm saved seed is a special feature of Australian agriculture which is not likely to change quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the argument that PVR would strengthen the hand of large profit-hungry multinationals, the review's conclusion was that such companies have plenty of competition from rival firms, the purchasing power of customers, producer cooperatives and farm organisations. In any case, the special Australian conditions&mdash;that is, using farm saved seed&mdash;were not attractive for the seed industry in general, and this applies to seed monopolies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some hopes for PVR as well as fears have not been realised so far, especially in agriculture, according to the review. Both sides were said to have `greatly exaggerated' the effects of PVR on self-pollinating crop industries. Thus, because there has been little flow of PVR benefits or incentives to new crop varieties in general, there has been little stimulus&mdash;that is, funds from PVR&mdash;to public sector breeding. As a result, such breeding on the whole continues to rely largely on governments and industry for levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the above conclusions may not appear to fully endorse the benefits of PVR, five years is really not a long enough period in which to get clear results. For example, most people would still not be seeing huge changes in the types of fruit, vegetables and nursery plants offered for sale. A PVR scheme is not enough by itself to bring about innovation in very conservative grower circles or to stimulate consumer demand for top varieties. But PVR is a necessary step in the vitalisation of a range of Australian plant varieties. Improved varieties lead to better productivity, better disease resistance, better keeping qualities and, ultimately, better consumer acceptance and market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation took us eight years to get into the House and receive proclamation. From 1987 to 1994 it was not amended. It has proved to be successful and will continue to play a major role in Australia's economic future. We are now witnessing a major change in many industries in Australia, especially in the vegetable and horticultural areas. We have just been debating levy bills in the Main Committee on the very issue of horticulture. The enormous markets of the future are there for vertically integrated operations in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a big jump forward from what we have been used to in Australia. Many of our producers in this area have been producing for a population of 15 million or 16 million; they need to start looking at markets consisting of hundreds of millions of people. The enormous jump to those markets is a very difficult concept for many Australian producers, requiring the development of capital in order to achieve the objectives that everybody seeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly believe that this type of legislation, plus the approach that is now being developed in the horticultural industry, the vegetable industry and other industries in Australia to look at export markets and at the Australian market as an integral part of the overall production and not the production base, is the way for Australia to go. In that way consumers in Australia can have the benefit of buying products at world competitive prices rather than being asked to subsidise smaller inefficient industries. We are heading down that path. We are seeing success after success around Australia. </PARA>

That did not stop the local organisations, with the support of the government, getting their act together, doing their studies, formulating their proper business plans and developing their marketing approaches. Today they are starting to move into export markets. Rather than trying to truck their product to the Melbourne markets, they are using the latest technologies in production, packaging and shipping. They are being very successful in reaching niche markets in Europe&mdash;something we would not have dreamed of five to 10 years ago.

To have legislation introduced after an eight-year period and then not come back into parliament from 1987 to 1994 shows that the job was done properly; that the industries worked with the government to achieve what was beneficial to Australia. There is a new mood in Australia today in relation to this cooperation. </PARA>

We are not talking about a $16 million market anymore; we are talking about a large market where the small producers as well as the big players in the wool, wheat and beef industries are entitled to be involved. It is in that area that I believe this parliament can play a major role. I strongly support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation currently before the House, as does the coalition, because we acknowledge the essential role that plant breeders rights have applied in the development of all crops in Australia since they were introduced in 1986. We recognise that this legislation replaces what was once known as the Plant Variety Rights Act. I acknowledge that in the initial stage of this legislation some apprehension has been expressed, particularly in the grain growing community, about what the changes that were proposed by the government might do. There were those in the grain growing community who felt that the changes proposed in this bill would mean that they were unable to hold on-farm grain. </PARA>

In an article written in July this year in a newspaper in my electorate, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Murray Pioneer</EMPHASIS>, Mr Mitchell Hooke, the Executive Director of the Grains Council of Australia, stated:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that some are attempting to use the issue of farmers' rights as a means of subverting plant property rights in totality.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a bipartisan view taken up by Mr Hooke. He found it necessary to address the concerns of farmers, which had largely been inflamed by statements that may have been well intentioned but were unfounded and originated from the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want briefly to report to the House the perhaps well intentioned but, in my view, unfounded comments made by Senator Woodley of the Australian Democrats. In his submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, concerning the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, Senator Woodley said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats hold philosophical and ethical objections to the Bill. The allocation of exclusive rights over plant varieties establishes a system of private property rights over living organisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of living organisms, whether they are natural or the product of human innovation, is morally objectionable. As Greenpeace has pointed out in its submission to the Committee, the ownership of species runs counter to the UN Charter for Nature which recognises the principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind. The UPOV Convention, the PVR Act and the PBR Bill compromise this principle by vesting ownership of plant varieties with private individuals or companies.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the view of the Grains Council of Australia, the federal opposition and the government&mdash;effectively, in numerical terms, the view of this parliament&mdash;that this bill does not compromise those who seek to use PBR for their own economic advantage. The purpose of the bill is not to offer exclusive ownership over living material, as alleged by Senator Woodley, but rather to encourage the production of new varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that the bill sets out to put a time limit on the period for which anyone can claim any sense of ownership over a particular plant variety. I, by the way, am not offended by any sense of ownership. It is true that it will extend the current period of 20 years for horticultural crops to 25 years, but that is an entirely responsible thing to do. There is a range of horticultural crops that do not get into the production stage until the third or fourth year, and no shortage of crops, such as citrus or pears, that are not into economic production until the 10th year. Anyone producing those varieties may well wait 11 or 12 years before anyone else is convinced that the variety has any real potential to justify their purchasing it and putting it in the ground. To offer someone an additional 10 or 12 years exclusive right over that material does not cause me any offence at all. Clearly, it does not cause the parliament any offence and, most significantly, it does not cause my growers, represented by the Grains Council of Australia, any offence at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill allows us to continue to do what the Plant Variety Rights Bill has done so well in the past. What I think ought to be significant for every Australian producer, whether horticulturalist or agriculturalist, is that New Zealand farmers, who were much more rapid than we were in the development of plant variety rights and in the development of markets of a number of horticultural products in innovative ways, found within 10 years of the introduction of plant variety rights a 500 per cent increase in the availability of plant breeding material to New Zealand producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that Australian producers need right now it is the opportunity to have a range of new crops and new varieties at their fingertips in order to tap into existing and expanding Asian markets. I will come back to that point in a moment. My reference to the Asian markets prompts me to pick up the other point of criticism levelled at this bill. That is the suggestion that the implementation of plant breeders rights as a worldwide concept would in some way disadvantage those in Third World countries. It was presumed they would be unable to access what was seen as more expensive breeding material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not adhere or subscribe to that argument at all. In fact, I confess to having spent too little time in Third World countries. However, from the little time I have spent in Third World countries, it strikes me that they already have a number of varieties of fruit and vegetables&mdash;maybe grain crops as well, but I can speak authoritatively only about the fruit and vegetable area&mdash;which would already be useful in an Australian situation. They need some of the genetic characteristics that are significant and unique to our crops. The opportunity for us to develop those genetic characteristics, knowing there is a market for them, exists because of PBR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the initial cost of fruit and vegetable material, particularly of fruit material in terms of budded trees, is a very small proportion of the total cost of establishing an orchard and of the ultimate cost of getting it into production, having held it in that state for about 10 years. I think this bill allows those in Third World countries who are looking for a genetic range and a set of varieties that might suit their own unique situation a chance to tap into the market. The total cost of their development will be infinitely more than the small cost of the additional price that will apply to the budded material that they use as part of their horticultural expansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If my arguments for horticulture are not persuasive enough, let us look at the matter of grain. Every Australian grain grower recognises the need for increasing protein levels in Australian grain, something that the shadow minister for transport, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), is more aware of than most other people. It is one of those things that will be developed only as a result of the opportunity for people breeding grain varieties to capitalise on that new market and to be recognised for the work that they have done in that grain breeding exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Wakefield we have a large irrigation area known as the Riverland, which is very significant in horticultural terms across Australia. In that area only last week I spoke to one of the innovative growers known as Mr Michael Troutwein. He has developed an expanding market for plums using what is called the tatura trellis, where plum trees are encouraged to be developed in a way something akin to grape vines because they are trellised on a Y-frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plum varieties that Mr Troutwein grows are not the varieties that he would like for the Asian market. He would like new varieties developed. His plum varieties are okay and they are giving him a market niche, but he recognises that the Asian taste is for a much sweeter plum than that of the traditional Australian production. He would like the opportunity to develop a sweeter plum, to access Asian varieties of plums, to produce them in the clean and green environment of the Riverland and therefore expand an export market. This bill allows him more rapid access to that material and the opportunity to develop a new market for the Riverland and, by implication, Australian horticulture in Asia. We ought to be encouraging that to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that sort of reason that the government and the opposition believe this bill is in the nation's best interests and do not subscribe to the theory that the bill in some way allows exclusive perpetual proprietary rights. In fact, it allows those proprietary rights for the people who have developed the new variety only for a sufficient period to get some sort of recognition for the work that they have done and for the chances that they have taken in that development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good illustration of plant variety rights is what happens in the apple and pear industry. Few horticultural industries have been as innovative in planting patterns as the apple and pear industry. The New Zealanders led the way and around Australia today we will find, thanks to the existing PVR legislation, hopefully enhanced by this bill, a large number of apple orchards going into dwarf varieties and a range of new varieties that are giving us the opportunity to not only get into the Asian market but also capture a foothold in what was once our traditional market, that is, the markets of Europe. The apple industry illustrates best of all the changes in varieties that can occur when people are allowed to tap into a range of plant varieties and when plant breeders are given some recognition, in monetary terms, for the work they have done and the chances they have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A month ago, at a small town called Kersbrook in the Adelaide Hills in the corner of my electorate, I was trudging round a cherry orchard which comprises eight hectares and is now totally covered by mesh. The grower covered it with mesh to allow him to grow the cherries in an environment into which birds could not go. As cherry growers know, in Australia 40 per cent of our cherry production is lost to birds. Here is a grower who is doing something that I would have thought was impossible: he is growing cherries to export them into Asia and, in some cases, into Europe in the off-season. His cherry orchard is only four years old. He picked the first crop last year. The crop totalled something like five tonnes, four tonnes of which was exported to premium markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that grower most needs now, having managed to keep the birds out of his cherry orchard, is access to varieties sufficiently dwarfing to keep them under the mesh. As one can appreciate, once a limb goes through the mesh one no longer has a bird-protected cherry orchard. He is currently keeping those vigorous cherry trees below the mesh by tying them down with a range of star droppers and ropes. This is to keep the limbs down, to train the cherry trees and to contain them as far as he is able. To his credit, he is succeeding in a very labour intensive operation. Imagine what we would do for him and for the cherry industry across Australia if we had access to varieties sufficiently dwarfing and sufficiently precocious to allow heavy cropping without the growth that is currently lost in excessive limbs and that makes the sealing of the area under mesh that much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation encourages those who are in cherry production to produce dwarf varieties of cherries knowing that they will be recognised in monetary terms for the risks that they have taken and that they will ultimately add to the horticultural potential of this country. It does not matter whether we are talking about the horticultural or agricultural industries, it is not hard to imagine the advantages that could flow from successful and constructive genetic manipulation and from some technique that adequately allows plant breeders to be recognised for the chances they take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effectively, the legislation before the House allows us to conform to the 1991 revision of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. It encourages the  increased investment in plant breeding and in technology transfer that we need if we are to encourage export industries, particularly export agricultural industries, in Australia. It improves our access to export material that is overseas and that we could usefully use in Australia to expand our horticultural base. Because of the number of pluses that this legislation offers to the Australian horticultural and agricultural industries, it has the support of the coalition. </PARA>

I was involved in chairing the Main Committee for some 60 minutes which kept me away from this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, while it is a rewritten version of and does contain some amendments and differences to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987, does have bipartisan support in this chamber. The legislation has been the cause of great angst throughout the community and industry over the years. It has been debated and discussed and consultations have taken place. The honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) indicated that, for quite a period before 1987, when the first bill was introduced and passed, there was a degree of consultation and work done with the industry to formulate the original Plant Variety Rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent, the angst to which I have referred has been dissipated within industry but not necessarily completely. I think we must recognise, for instance, that people are still concerned about where some of the aspects of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill might be taking us. Overall, I think the consultation process has been to the credit of the government. It has been quite worth while and productive and has meant that we have the support of the opposition&mdash;and, more importantly, quite a few of the peak industry bodies have supported this bill&mdash;to ensure its smooth passage in implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable members, like the honourable member for McMillan, will no doubt remember the original debates prior to 1987 about where we were going with this legislation. In the period since then, time itself should have addressed some of those concerns and should have indicated that the original Plant Variety Rights Act was not an act which would enable the multinational corporations or vested interests to have cart blanche control over the genetic material which exists naturally and can also be put together scientifically and purposefully by plant breeders. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994, and the amendments that have been raised by the government, address most of the concerns, if not 99 per cent of the concerns, of the electorate at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects of the bill have already been alluded to by the honourable member for Wakefield and the honourable member for McMillan, some of whose remarks I was able to hear. The legislation has allowed horticultural industries as well as the floricultural industries to introduce new varieties. In my electorate both of those industries are quite substantial. In the horticultural area we have not only a banana industry, which has been present for quite some time, but also a burgeoning stone fruit industry. That has come about because particular varieties&mdash;for example, low chill varieties&mdash;have been introduced which have been able to exist in the wonderful climate on the north coast and which have produced a multimillion dollar industry and become a national leader in the stone fruit industry. I pay tribute to the breeders involved, particularly around the Bangalow area where most of that industry is established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the material which has come into the country has come from the Florida region of the United States of America where a number of low chill varieties were developed. They were brought into Australia, checked and tested and have been quite productive in parts of my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The banana industry, in some ways, will also come under the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. There are a number of different varieties and qualities of bananas. With recourse to the intention of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, the industry will be able to pour more money into breeding disease resistant varieties as well as different quality varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects of the Plant Variety Rights Act, which is being replaced here, and the present Plant Breeder's Rights Bill we are debating have left questions in the community. I would like to address those in my remarks here this afternoon. The access of the public, particularly farmers, to plant material has been addressed in debate on the bill today in that protected plants cannot be held from the public as such. There is recourse to the bill if that happens. Farmers can freely save seed for their own use, which was one of my immediate concerns. That has been addressed in the bill. We will not have a situation where farmers are not able to reserve the seed or plant material they have grown on their farms for future years' growth. They will not be subject to any tax, excise or whatever. They will legally be able to save that seed, as they have done in the past. No doubt that has led the Grains Council of Australia and the National Farmers Federation to support this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern within the electorate at large concerns naturally occurring plants and even yet to be discovered natural plants. It would be remiss of us as legislators if we did not recognise that across Australia more than likely there are plant species to be discovered and classified. The worth of particular plants that we have even now is yet to be recognised. The application of some of the chemicals and so forth which are in plants has only just now been appreciated. I am obviously referring to the knowledge that is held by our indigenous people as well as to plants which may not be known to us. Chemicals have been discovered in plants and patented. I refer to some situations overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the naturally occurring plant varieties or ecotypes of native species will not be covered, to the extent that they will not be subject to plant variety rights. At the same time, any particular chemical which might be within a plant, both known and unknown, would not be covered by the plant variety rights legislation. There would have to be some other recourse. A plant, whether it be a plant which is already deemed to be protected under the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill or some other plant that is yet to be discovered and possibly for which inclusion under plant breeders rights will be sought, will still be available for both farmers and for research. That is most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of patents to cover the chemicals within a particular plant would not be covered by this legislation; there would have to be recourse to the patenting laws and so forth for that to apply. The fact that that is the case is important. Many plants, including algae and fungi, are included in this bill now under the new definition of a plant. It is most important that what we can discover from those plants now or in the future not be locked up by simple recourse to the plant breeders rights legislation, for instance. What has occurred naturally to a large extent should be available. If it is incorporated or changed around by me, by a scientist or by anyone else, then it is good luck to them. But under the definition held within the bill the words `essentially derived' should cover all that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has bipartisan support. It addresses 99 per cent of the electorate's concerns. The honourable member for McMillan indicated strongly how the bill will ensure that investment, scientific research, time and money are put into new plant varieties. In the process of government it is up to us to put in place legislation and mechanisms which will assist the development of industries. I am very confident that the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill will achieve those aims, that is, lead to the development of industry and assist the farming community in general. Industries such as the horticulture and floriculture industries already have achieved much through the present bill which this bill is replacing. In that sense I commend the bill to the House. I look forward to seeing its implementation and the achievement of those aims. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current wording of the act requires that reprints of the legislation must contain some 150 to 200 pages of schedules which are unnecessary.

Paragraph 5(1)(a) of the Hearing Services Act 1991 defines those who are eligible to receive Commonwealth hearing concessions from Australian Hearing Services. The amendment will substitute reference to the pensioner health benefits card with `pensioner concession card'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes amendments to a number of acts relating to health services. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the Health Legislation Amendment Act 1986, the Hearing Services Act 1991, the National Health Act 1953 and the National Health Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main thrust of the bill is fourfold. Firstly, it tightens controls over pathology services. Secondly, it allows the level of Medicare benefits to be set by regulation without reprinting in the schedule of the act. Thirdly, it restricts the eligibility of persons for safety net concession cards for pharmaceutical benefits. Fourthly, it provides for brand substitution by pharmacists of drugs or medication prescribed by doctors in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will turn firstly to the tightening controls over pathology services. The bill deals with this issue in two ways. Firstly, it deals with the supervision of pathology services. The Health Insurance Act 1973 provides the legislative basis for the payment and administration of Medicare benefits in relation to medical and hospital services. These proposed amendments seek to tighten control over pathology services by defining the meaning of supervision. Medicare benefits are payable only if the services are performed or given on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The proposed amendments dictate that a pathology service will not attract the Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged proper supervision of that service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed section 3AA(3) states that proper supervision has been arranged if the approved pathology practitioner ensures that a properly qualified person supervises the rendering of the service and has personal responsibility for the proper rendering of that service. According to the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of proposed section 3AA is to enable the minister to provide for the definition of adequate supervision of pathology services, rendered by or on behalf of an approved pathology practitioner. The question of whether proper supervision is provided is to be decided in accordance with the written principles which will be determined by the minister. The explanatory memorandum goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is that these principles will be modelled upon National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council standards and applied using currently accepted practice for the approving of premises as accredited pathology laboratories. New subsection 3AA(5) provides for the determination of the principles to be a disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA>The second area of tightened control is in relation to the location of collection centres for approved pathology authorities. The bill replaces the existing section 23DNB with a new section 23DNB which incorporates and adds to the old section. The explanatory memorandum notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to allow the Minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presumably the Minister will be able to have some influence over the distribution of the collection centres to ensure that more remote or less economically advantageous locations will have reasonable access to pathology collection services.</PARA>
<PARA>Proposed section 23DNB(3) provides that the minister must determine in writing principles with which she must comply in performing her duties under that section. The bill provides that these principles must include a formula or other method for allocating entitlements, the circumstances and method for varying an allocation and the number and location of collection centres that can be operated under an entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seek an undertaking from the government concerning the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the intention of the amendments is to allow the minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to provide an undertaking that the principles required to be determined in writing by the minister and subject to tabling and disallowance will address the need for collection centres in rural and isolated Australia to allow fair access. I am aware of a proposal that provision should be made for use of the allocation in operating licences on a one for three basis in rural and remote statistical local areas, as defined by `rural other' and `remote other' in the January 1994 Department of Human Services and Health publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rural/remote areas classification</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main thrust of the bill concerns the table of fees. The level of Medicare benefit which is payable for a particular service is calculated on the basis of a lengthy table of fees. Prior to these proposed amendments, the relevant tables were in schedules to the act. Schedule 1 related to general medical services and schedule 1A related to pathology services. The bill omits the provisions requiring the tables to appear in the schedules to the act and instead the bill provides that the level of Medicare benefits will be set by regulation alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thrust of the bill is important and deals with the eligibility of safety net concession cards. These proposed amendments relate to the National Health Act 1953 which establishes the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and ensures that pharmaceuticals are provided to the general public at a maximum of $16 per item. Where an individual or family spends more on pharmaceuticals than the safety net figure of $400 a year, any further prescriptions are provided at a reduced rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme also provides safety net concession cards for some patients, including pensioners, the unemployed, low income families, veterans, and war widows and their dependants. Eligible recipients pay $2.60 per prescription until their annual expenditure reaches $135.20. After this safety net level has been reached, pharmaceuticals are provided at no cost to the cardholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes an amendment to ensure that the safety net concession cards will be available only to people who are eligible to receive Medicare benefits. Such eligibility to receive Medicare benefits is generally extended to Australian residents and certain members of diplomatic missions. The restriction of the safety net concession card to Australian residents was the result of a 1994-95 budget decision and is estimated to result in a saving of $1 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people who require medication as outpatients, especially in the medium and long term, may wonder what has happened to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme safety net when they realise that the cost of pharmaceuticals rose by 14.3 per cent in the March quarter to 1994. The Australian economic indicators at June 1994 attribute this increase to the reduced  effect of the PBS safety net scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmacy Guild of Australia has expressed concern at the lack of reimbursement for the extra workload imposed on it by this bill. The Pharmacy Guild argues that under the new legislation, as an additional step, pharmacists will be required to sight the Medicare card, to transcribe the Medicare number and to forward details to the HIC for eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued that pharmacists will also have to explain to patients why concession cards have been denied and try to recover from patients the difference between the concession and the non-concession prescription cost. Alternatively, the pharmacists will have to charge non-concession prices and then refund the difference when cards are validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth main thrust of the legislation concerns brand substitution, which is considered to be a controversial area. These proposed amendments also relate to the National Health Act 1953. The main proposal is to amend the National Health Act so as to allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication that is marketed under a different name from the drug or medication which is specified in the prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the proposed amendment is to allow the  pharmacist to substitute a generic product for a branded one. This can occur only when the patent for the branded product has run out and generics are being manufactured. When a branded product is prescribed, the patient is required to pay a premium for the product, which on average is between 50c and $1. There can be a definite preference by individuals for a product with which they are familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substitution will be allowed only in the following circumstances: firstly, if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified branded drug or medication is to be supplied; secondly, if a schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent; thirdly, if a ministerial determination allowing the substituted genetic drug or medication to be marketed under a particular brand name is in force; and, fourthly, if the supply of the substituted brand is not prohibited under state or territory law. This change has resulted from an agreement between state and Commonwealth health ministers concerning rules under which pharmacists dispense medication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed changes have been supported by the Pharmacy Guild of Australia. The Pharmaceutical Society of Australia has stated that the bill's proposals do not appear likely to have any significant impact on the pharmacy profession. However, the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association has expressed concern about two issues of the legislation. The first concern is with the term `equivalent'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection (2A) (b) provides that one of the conditions required to be met before substitution can occur is that "the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits issued by the Department states that the specific benefit and the substitute benefit are equivalent".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current practice is for the Department to identify products where brands have demonstrated bioequivalence to the satisfaction of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) through the addition of an appropriate identifier in the PBS Schedule, and APMA considers that it is this practice which subsection (2A) (b) seeks to address. The use of "equivalence" has a much broader meaning than "bio-equivalence" and APMA proposes that the latter term be used in (2A) (b) and that both the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech make it clear that this subsection refers only to demonstration of bioequivalence and nothing wider.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the submission which the APMA put to the government. It received an indication from the Department of Human Services and Health that the government was sympathetic to that proposition, as it was to the next one. But no action has been taken by the government in this regard. The second concern of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association related to co-marketed products. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of instances where the same pharmaceutical product is marketed as two or more separate and distinct brands with separate marketing and PBS listing approvals, co-marketed by competing pharmaceutical companies. APMA is concerned that the legislation as currently drafted could allow pharmacists to substitute one brand of such products for another, even though consumer premiums under the Minimum Pricing Policy, which the amendments are intended to allow consumers to avoid if they so choose, are not charged in such cases. APMA supports the proposals advanced by AMRAD Corporation Limited that this problem be resolved by the insertion of the following paragraph into subsection (2A):&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) either:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">i) the specific benefit is a drug or medicinal preparation, the patent for which has expired; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ii) if the specific benefit is a drug or medicinal preparation which is under patent, the manufacturer has agreed that the specified benefit may be the subject of substitution under the subsection; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraphs (c) and (d) in the existing draft Bill would then be renumbered (d) and (e).</PARA>
<PARA>I understood that these amendments had been proposed to the government and that contact between the department of health and the APMA had indicated that there was sympathy from the government. However, the parliamentary secretary has advised me that the government will not be moving those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the bill, but it does draw attention to the points made by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. It notes the need to monitor the operation of the new provisions to ensure that the system works as it is intended and that unfairness to patients and manufacturers does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In saying that we do not oppose the bill, I still request an undertaking from the parliamentary secretary concerning the pathology collection centres in rural and isolated Australia. There is a great deal of concern in Australia about the access of people in rural and isolated Australia to a fair and equitable health system. It is for that reason that we specifically request that undertaking. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to concentrate my remarks on the parts of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which deal with pathology services&mdash;first, the provision that a pathology service will not attract the Medicare benefit unless the pathologist has arranged proper supervision of the service by a properly qualified person; and, second, the minister for health being allowed to influence the location of pathology collection centres and ensuring that more remote or less economically advantageous locations will have reasonable access to pathology collection services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address the issue of the location of pathology services and, more generally, the regionalisation of Australia's health system. For instance, the Australian Hospital Association has suggested that pathology services could be used to test the benefits of managed competition; that is, to a purchaser-provider split in health and regional plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in health policy stems from the issues of equity, access and location, and their impact on my electorate. The distribution of health services in Sydney reflects historical, rather than contemporary, patterns of urban settlement. This lag means that most beds and services, such as pathology, are where the people used to live&mdash;not where they live now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the East Sydney Area Health Service has 6.9 beds per 1,000 population, while south-west Sydney, which covers the electorate of Werriwa, has just 2.4 beds per 1,000. The south-west region has 11.1 per cent of the state's population, yet it receives only 7.3 per cent of health funding. Just as the federal government cannot rely on the states to redistribute health resources on the basis of need, it cannot count on them to tackle the growing gap in Australia between the demand for health care and the availability of services. The availability of pathology services, both public and private, would be much greater in Sydney's northern and eastern suburbs than in the south-west. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health status and needs of Australians are linked not just to how they live but where they live, hence the importance of community health programs that bring together preventive health and healthier lifestyles. The social justice research program into locational disadvantage, for instance, in a study in Adelaide in 1993 concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Measures of socioeconomic status are strong predictors of variations in health status and variations in the use of health services between geographic areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The study estimated the additional health costs of the consequences of socioeconomic disadvantage at more than $200 million annually in metropolitan Adelaide. It recommended in the reconsideration of public policy the addition of `an element of targeting policy of universal coverage with socioeconomic and locational factors bulking large in the set of indicators that would underpin the targeted approach'. That is, it is never sufficient for government to share its endeavours and activities in health equally across all locations. This is one of the flaws in the resource allocation formula developed by some of the states solely on the basis of regional population shares. Just as much, effective health policy should have regard for broader lifestyle issues such as employment, transport and recreation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill takes up issues of location and access for pathology services. It seeks to fulfil the original intention of section 23DNC of the Health Insurance Act 1973 to allow the minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am an advocate of structural reform to Australia's health system to achieve purposes such as these&mdash;that is, to simplify the role of the federal government in health and overcome the inefficiency of the current federal relations. Health policy has become one of the most difficult issues in Australian public life. Scarce resources are expected to meet the growing health demands of a community accustomed to the highest standards of medical care. In Australia this challenge is made more difficult by the uncoordinated and confusing responsibilities in health between the national government and the states. In 1991 the national health strategy reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The numerous, separate Commonwealth and State programs delivering primary health and community care lack cohesion and clear policy and service objectives. Many are providing similar services to the same target groups. Without overall policy and program integration, one cannot be confident that services are being targeted to those most in need, and that resources are being targeted to the most effective services.</PARA>
<PARA>This basic inefficiency is aggravated by the disparate treatment of public and private services by both the federal and state governments. This applies particularly in a service such as pathology. The distinction between the public and private health activities in Australia cannot be made by ownership and funding sources, but by methods of reimbursement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private activities&mdash;such as medical services, pharmaceuticals, private hospitals and private pathology services&mdash;are funded on an uncapped, fee-for-service basis at above average cost prices. Public services&mdash;such as nursing homes and public hospitals&mdash;are funded by capped annual grants with little recognition of service demand and volumes. These arrangements inhibit the movement of resources from less efficient to more efficient health programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific problems include: first, incentives for cost shifting&mdash;for example, the privatisation of outpatient clinics shifts costs from state governments to the direct billing of Medicare. In Victoria in 1993-94 this technique transferred more than one million outpatient services onto the federal budget. Across the board the costs of services have shifted from the financially capped public hospital sector into the uncapped Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits schemes&mdash;in accident and emergency departments, and pharmaceutical, radiology and pathology services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, there are splits in health service provision whereby service providers are responsible for their own activities but not necessarily accountable for the general health status of patients. Differential funding arrangements also jeopardise rational choices between models of health care. The proper administration and resourcing of community health strategies has become exceptionally difficult in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, a limited role for the great bulk of health professionals while in the specialities an undersupply of staff has produced excessive costs and prices. Health gains can be realised by liberating and broadening the role of general practitioners into community health activities. Fourth, we have a peculiar mix of health resources&mdash;with underfunded public hospitals and a private hospital system with surplus capacity yet insecure financial arrangements due to its dependence on private health insurance and a role residual to the activities of the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn more specifically to the benefits of managed competition and pathology services. Pathology is another example in Australian health of how advances in technology have overtaken the structure of the health system. The services emerged in the 1950s as predominantly private, free-standing laboratories due to the dominance of fee-for-service reimbursement underwritten by medical benefits, then Medibank and Medicare. Public laboratories have been restricted to tests for hospital patients&mdash;that is, low volume, high cost procedures&mdash;while the private sector has taken up the more profitable high volume, low cost work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1980s automated technology greatly expanded the capacity for testing and volume of test work. Only private pathology services were in a position to take advantage of this expanded market. By custom and practice, public laboratories have not pursued the substantial revenue opportunities of non-hospital private work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unhappily, this disadvantage has been entrenched in the current legislation as public hospitals are not entitled to the patient episode initiation fee for the collection of specimens. In this era of national competition policy, with an ownership-neutral framework for all policy, it is indefensible for private providers to have monopoly rights in servicing the GP and non-hospital sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Minister for Health (Dr Lawrence) to establish a level playing field between public and private pathology services. Otherwise, with the preparation of the government's model legislation for competition policy, this could well become the first instance of federal anti-competitive practices placed before the Australian Competition Commission. Let us hope it never comes to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pathology also exposes a typical inconsistency in the funding arrangements for Australia's health services. While private pathology is financed out of Medicare benefits, public services are funded by the states from grants or own revenue sources. Some laboratories in public hospitals have even been corporatised yet with none of the competitive advantages or uncapped revenue sources provided by government policy to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the national health strategy questioned the funding arrangements for private pathology services. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are many people who believe that pathology is the medical service least suited to fee-for-service and that the present balance between fee-for-service and other systems should be changed . . . Pathology is an institutionalised service, not a personal one, whether the institutions are publicly or privately owned. There is no direct doctor-patient relationship which would make fee-for-service meaningful.</PARA>
<PARA>I am attracted to the proposal of the Australian Hospital Association to establish budget holder arrangements and a purchaser-provider split for the pathology industry. This structure would establish fair competition between public and private providers and thereby contain costs and improve the quality and accessibility of services. Through payments to regional budget holders it would, with greater overall efficiency, meet the objectives of this legislation for the equitable provision of pathology collection services in remote and less economically attractive locations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the opposition and, in particular, its shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), who has been in and out of the chamber displaying her lack of interest in this important issue, that managed competition is not without its supporters in the private sector. After all, competition is inherent in the ethos and activities of private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, on 23 June, I had published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> an article about managed competition in health. I was pleased to receive a very supportive letter for this approach from the managing director of Hampson Pathology Services in Newcastle, Mr John Cameron. I might just read for the benefit of the shadow minister the views that her much touted private sector actually holds about modern, effective health administration in Australia in the 1990s. Mr Cameron wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we could apply our modern systems and management skills in the public hospital system to deliver the same efficiency to the public sector as we currently achieve, the savings could be as high as 30 per cent of the public pathology budget. All too often the debate in health is about more money with very little focus on how to make the system more effective.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say, quite kindly, that he thought my article was excellent. I think his point of view is excellent. It is a point of view that the opposition could well learn from. In Australian health, and especially in pathology, it is not really a question  of public versus private ownership. Hilmer and the national framework have taught everyone that these considerations should be ownership neutral. Anyone who has an obsession with the private sector, such as the shadow minister for health, will pick up only half of the equation of effective health policy in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be clearly defined, arms-length agreements between the federal government and the states for the financing and delivery of a comprehensive range of health services.

There should be implementation of regional health management&mdash;on the New South Wales model, for example&mdash;responsible for a full range of health services. Other reforms should be equitable funding of geographic areas, using resource allocation models based on population and targeted needs; payment to service providers on an output basis, with a pricing mechanism such as casemix; and fair competition and equal opportunity for public and private providers to secure performance based service contracts from the budget holders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying my best. Pathology services would be a fine starting point for Australia's progression to managed health competition. There is another issue arising out of this legislation. The model that I have proposed of budget holders at the regional level farming out, on the basis of need and equity, work to both the public and private sectors could be accommodated within the health structures we have in Australia at the moment. This is not commonly understood on the other side of the chamber. In our last sitting week in June, when I was away for health reasons, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) described my set of reforms as an attempt to move towards the British system of health care, towards nationalisation of our health system. It just goes to show that the honourable member for Warringah, obsessed with one issue, knows nothing about other issues. In his own state of New South Wales the health regions are in place, and they are ideally suited to the implementation of the sorts of reforms that I have outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a broad and very important agenda for the government to pick up in regional health provision. Going by the comments of the member for Warringah&mdash;the young fogy from Warringah&mdash;they have not got a proper understanding of those opportunities on the other side of the chamber; and that, of course, carries over to the adjoining electorate to the north. But the opportunity is there. The debate on this bill is one in a series of debates in which the parliament can consider the recommendations in the national health strategy in 1991. It should be compulsory reading for anyone in the chamber who is interested in the health debate. It shows the way forward to the sort of meaningful health reform we can have in Australia, free from the ideological obsessions of those opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This certainly is a wide ranging debate, and we are getting into a few diverse subjects. The bill that is being debated today, the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, mainly proposes amendments to a number of acts relating to health services. The main changes include tightening controls over pathology services, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), has covered fairly well; allowing fees for general medical services and pathology which form the basis for calculating medical benefits to be consolidated in the regulations, rather than forming a schedule to the legislation, and being updated by regulation; restricting the issue of safety net concession cards for pharmaceutical benefits to people who are eligible for Medicare benefits; and allowing substitution of some prescription medications by pharmacists, subject to certain conditions. It is that fourth element of these amendments that I am mostly interested in. I have spoken in this chamber on a number of occasions about the prescribing and the dispensing of generic drugs, and I will come to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It behoves me to comment&mdash;and I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will pull me up as soon as you want to&mdash;on some of the comments by the honourable member for Werriwa with regard to using staff from outside and from vested interests. The ALP should never complain about the outside control of political operatives or political parties when that party is so closely affiliated with, and under the control of, the ACTU. It is outrageous for it to talk about special interests and giving jobs out. Yesterday we saw the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) appoint Neville Wran and the head of the republican movement to the new board of ANL. These are people who know nothing about shipping, and he is paying an extraordinary amount of some $150,000 to those two people in the first six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that the government should crow too much about who does what around this place. It would not hurt from time to time to consult the specialists on all sides of an argument or an issue. It is very important that in this particular case people from all sides be consulted in the formulation of changes to the way health services are provided in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I was interested to hear the member for Werriwa outline what he sees as the future of health services in Australia. It certainly is interesting and, as I understand it, a little bit contrary to the way that the ALP opposition in New South Wales sees regional health services and the way those services are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important issue today in Australia in health services is breaking down and getting rid of the waiting lists. It is all about the lack of funding. The public system, the public purse, cannot provide the funding to do it. I am sure this government, with its bent for privatisation and with its absolute commitment to competition policy, is going to head down that path. Maybe the honourable member for Werriwa could talk to the opposition in New South Wales about some of the things it proposes for the provision of health services in New South Wales. It is looking backwards 20 years rather than looking forward, which is what we must do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Hilmer has indicated that. He has also indicated that we have to knock down the monopolistic way the government runs things and look at alternative methods of providing services to the community because the public purse cannot afford the present services. That message needs to be sent to Mr Carr and his colleagues in New South Wales, who are running a very political agenda on privatisation at the moment, certainly not one in step with the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ran through an outline of the sorts of things that are being proposed in this bill. The tightening of controls over the pathology services is of concern. The bill proposes to omit the current provisions which allow the minister to determine the maximum number of centres, in compliance with any written principles the minister may determine. The new section is designed to allow the minister to have some influence over the location of pathology centres and to ensure that remote and less economically advantageous locations have reasonable access to pathology collection services. Three mandatory principles will be applied in the allocation of units of entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it should be set out more clearly exactly what services are going to be invited to more remote areas. I understand that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), is seeking an undertaking concerning the statement in the explanatory memorandum that the intention of the amendments is to allow the minister to act to alleviate hardship caused by the commercial decisions of pathology practices in locating their collection centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the shadow minister is asking the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) to provide an undertaking that the principles required to be determined in writing by the minister and subject to tabling and disallowance will address the need for collection centres in rural and isolated Australia to allow for fair access. For instance, there is a proposal that provision should be made for the use of the allocation in operating licences at one-third in rural and remote statistical local areas, as defined by the terms `rural other' and `remote other' in a January 1994 Department of Human Services and Health publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all about fairness, equity and access&mdash;access for those people a little bit more remote than the majority of the population of Australia living in metropolitan areas. People who live in rural and regional Australia have an expectation of&mdash;and also deserve&mdash;similar services at a similar price to those enjoyed by their cousins in the metropolitan areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I alluded to where we are heading with the Hilmer report, to competition policy and to the path the government is heading down with the privatisation of a lot of government services. As a National Party member of this national parliament representing a rural and regional seat, I stress that we need to be ever mindful of, and very vigilant about, what is going to happen to the equality of services in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of health service is only one concern. We have to be careful and vigilant that all the services that we have enjoyed, sometimes at a slightly dearer rate than our city cousins enjoy, are not eroded in the government's bent for privatisation, for trying to generate maximum competition and the philosophy of user pays. The government's policy affects not only medical and health services but also postal services, communications, transport&mdash;everything that we do in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are particularly discriminated against by this government through its fuel tax policy, which impacts far more on my constituents and your constituents, Mr Deputy Speaker, than it does on the constituents of a lot of the government members. The government collects 40c or 44c a litre in Commonwealth taxes from our road users. We have to be very vigilant and highlight these matters in this parliament when a bill such as this is under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the request that is being made by the shadow minister to the parliamentary secretary and ultimately to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) that the government provide a level of equitable and fair access to these services to regional Australia. It is terribly important. I am sure that the government has recently recognised the importance of some of these regional seats. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is doing a lot of work; he is out in western New South Wales paying a bit of lip-service to the poor people suffering from the most devastating drought this country has ever had&mdash;today, out in the Dubbo area. The government might even get genuine and genuinely consider in legislation the plight of a lot of rural and regional people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on from that aspect, I point out that the bill proposes a change in the eligibility of safety net concession cards. The amendments relate to the National Health Act of 1953. The National Health Act also established the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Where an individual or family spends more on pharmaceuticals than a safety net figure of $400 in a year, any further prescriptions are provided at a reduced rate. The scheme also provides safety net concession cards for some patients, including pensioners, the unemployed, low income families, veterans, war widows and their dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes an amendment that will ensure that safety net concession cards will be available to people who are eligible to receive Medicare benefits. Eligibility to receive Medicare benefits is generally extended to Australian residents and certain members of diplomatic missions. The restriction of safety net concession cards to Australian residents implements a 1994-95 budget decision and is estimated to result in a saving of $1 million for 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something that should be highlighted is that, while the government of today will quite often go out into the community and say that it is doing this or that and providing this or that, this is all based on saving money, on compliance and on trying to hang on to more of the taxpayers' dollars that they have got to spend and that they are spending in other areas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to petrol taxes again. It was in last year's budget that this all came out. But what rose at the beginning of August this year? Petrol prices did. There was no big splash about it, because the announcement had been made last year. The Commonwealth revenue has rapidly increased every year that the Labor Party has been in power. History will record that fact, and also that this government has been the biggest taxing government the country has ever seen. There is no point in the parliamentary secretary arguing to the contrary, because that is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to go on to the next aspect of this bill, I believe its most important element: the amendment relating to the substitution of generic drugs with the express approval of the prescribing physician. It is something that I have been arguing for ever since I came into this parliament. This should have been done earlier this year. The former Minister for Health&mdash;Senator Richardson, as he was then&mdash;was talking about it for months and months without actually doing anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that time a constituent of mine who is a pharmacist was charged by the Health Insurance Commission and is the subject of a court case today over substituting generic drugs of equivalent chemical constituency that can do the same job. Exactly what is being addressed in this bill is the subject of a court case taking place today. On the very day the government introduces this bill to change the provisions on generic drugs, the government&mdash;through its instrumentality, the HIC&mdash;is continuing with the prosecution of a pharmacist who led the way in opening up competition in prescription drugs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) described this pharmacist as a bit of a white knight or a Robin Hood in this area, saying that he has brought to the surface the issue of the substitution of generic drugs.

In that speech I referred to the pharmacist Mr Keen, who is a constituent of mine in Wingham, and I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keen has adopted the philosophy that he has a duty of care to his patients which not only involves their obvious physical welfare but also their financial welfare. Mr Keen realised that it could be alleged he was breaking the law&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum pricing policy deregulates the price of drugs to allow prices to be set at what the market will bear, yet doctors won't allow their patients to have a choice. What I'm doing is giving them that choice. It seems to me that the government has brought in a policy about drug pricing, but the National Health Act has not been modified to allow that policy to be implemented properly.</PARA>
<PARA>What is being introduced today, six or seven months down the track, is amendments to the National Health Act 1953. The main amendment to the National Health Act will allow pharmacists to supply a substituted drug or medication that is marketed under a different brand name from the drug or medication which is specified in the prescription. The aim is to allow the pharmacist to substitute a generic product for a branded one. This can only occur where the patent for the branded product has run out and generics are being manufactured. Where a branded product is prescribed, the patient is required to pay a premium for the product which on average is between 50c and one dollar. There can be a definite preference by individuals for a product with which they are familiar. The substitution will only be allowed if the prescription does not indicate that only the specified branded drug or medication is supplied; a schedule of pharmaceutical benefits issued by the department states that the two drugs or medications are equivalent; a ministerial determination allowing the substituted generic drug or medication to be marketed under a particular brand name is in force; and the supply of a substituted brand is not prohibited under state or territory law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important element of this is that pharmacists for a lot of years, particularly since the implementation of computerisation in the dispensing process, have had at their fingertips all the information that has been available in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">British Pharmacopoeia</EMPHASIS> on their computers, so that you go in with a prescription for a drug and the pharmacist has a record&mdash;if it is the pharmacy that you continually go to&mdash;of what other medication you are on. Quite often they pick up what a medico has missed, that the drug that has been prescribed is going to interact with a drug that they are already receiving. Especially since the implementation of computerisation, the pharmacists have been providing that medical and professional service. They are also professional enough to be able to say, `This generic drug has exactly the same qualities as that branded drug that has been prescribed, yet it is $10 cheaper,' and that is the point that Mr Keen has continually made. I am not going to refer to him again, Mr Deputy Speaker, but that is the point that has been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Lloyd Sansom, of the College of Pharmacy at Adelaide University, has made it quite clear on a number of occasions that sometimes the benchmark or generic drugs are of better quality than the innovator drug. That is, the innovator drug might have been developed 20 years ago and the benchmark or generic drug has been developed today with modern technology and it is a drug better suited to treat the patient. So to make the generic drug equal to the innovator drug sometimes requires that the generic drug be of a lesser standard or a lower quality than it might be. These things need to be borne in mind when the government and its instrumentalities are putting together the legislation that we have seen today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the fact that the government has used the term `equivalency' or `equivalent' in the bill rather than `bioequivalent', because that does not mean the same thing. It is not important that that be a part of the legislation, as was suggested by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. It expressed concern about the use of the term `equivalency'. The association said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsection (2A) (b) provides that one of the conditions required to be met before substitution can occur is that "the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits issued by the Department states that the specific benefit and the substitute benefit are equivalent".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current practice is for the Department to identify products where brands have demonstrated bioequivalence to the satisfaction of the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) through the addition of an appropriate identifier in the PBS Schedule, and APMA considers that it is this practice which subsection (2A) (b) seeks to address. The use of "equivalence" has a much broader meaning than "bioequivalence" and APMA proposes that the latter term be used in (2A) (b) and that both the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech make it clear that this subsection refers only to demonstration of bioequivalence and nothing wider.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that needs to be the case. The research that I have done with representatives from the pharmacy profession has indicated that it is not necessary to have the term `bioequivalence' in the EM, but only `equivalence'. That goes back to what I set out earlier, which was from Professor Lloyd Sanson with regard to making them equivalent between the benchmark or generic drug and the innovator drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the majority of cases it has been found that the benchmark drug is of a much higher standard than the innovator drug.

I am certainly not suggesting that we need to go to the length that some have gone to in the United States, for example, where competition has led to advertising campaigns conducted by plastic surgeons, in which full-colour photographs of patients were published in the national press to highlight the differences in technique between individual plastic surgeons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to address an issue that is of great concern to me, and that is the greatly increased welfare mentality of our nation. I am going to be fairly frank in this speech and, for being honest, I will probably be abused and harangued, but it is high time attitudes changed and we realised that society does not owe people a living, that they must in time try to fend for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern increased after I received answers to some questions I placed on notice to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) regarding the young homeless allowance. It revealed that in Western Australia since 1987 the number of youths receiving the allowance increased by a staggering 1,062 1/2 per cent. It was introduced in June 1986, and in that year 10 Western Australians received the young homeless allowance. In the first full year of the allowance, 1987, there were 104 recipients in Western Australia and by 1993 that figure had ballooned to 1,209. I am not saying for one minute that all of these recipients were not worthy of the allowance. However, it is most evident that quite a number of the recipients were receiving the allowance when in fact they should not have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote a young person from the television program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> of 31 March this year to prove that the allowance is being used by some young people who do not need it. The young girl, Tanya, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was 15 years old when I got an allowance and I was living at home at the time. And we had a few arguments like, you know, dads and daughters always arguing and everything like that, and I just took it to the extreme, and I had heard at school that there was these people that the court says that help you and everything, and that you can go to them if you have got a problem and they care. So they sent me to the Social Security to get the young homeless allowance, and I just filled out the young homeless allowance forms and that was it. I was on young homeless two weeks later. The funny thing was, I wasn't homeless. I did have a home I could go to; it's just I chose not to.</PARA>
<PARA>That anecdote from Tanya is typical of how the system is exploited by many young people. For many families, the young homeless allowance is encouraging family break-ups by financing children who want to pack up and leave home. I find it ironic, in the International Year of the Family, that a welfare payment is being exploited, and in the process is splitting up families. To prove my point, I go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> show. When asked by Ray Martin whether she conned the system, Tanya's reply was, `Yes, very easy.' There are the side effects of this payment also, such as the young pregnancies. Tanya was four days overdue with a baby at that interview and admitted that she probably would not have been in that situation had she stayed at home. There are also the drug taking, the kids who decide to just live on the streets and the crime problem which stems from this. These are consequences of the young homeless allowance which are ruining the opportunities and the futures of many young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another young person on the program also admitted it was flawed in its administration. A young lady called Narelle said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's easy to bluff the system. You can go in there and say anything and they will give it to you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Narelle's next comments show how the young homeless allowance is ruining the futures of so many young kids in the country like ours, which has so many opportunities to offer our young. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now that I'm out of home, there is no way that I can go back, because I've got too much freedom now. If I moved back, I wouldn't have the freedom that I have. I couldn't go.</PARA>
<PARA>My question is: what sort of future does Narelle have? She will not have the education she deserves, she will not have the job opportunities she deserves, and this adds up to a future which, quite frankly, will not be bright and prosperous at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise there is a parliamentary committee looking into this allowance but, irrespective of the outcome of that committee, this allowance just backs up the view that there is an attitudinal view permeating through our Australian society and we are becoming a welfare state. Call it the young homeless allowance, call it the jobsearch allowance, call it what you like, if there is an offer of money from the government, there are many people&mdash;and these comments are not aimed at the legitimate claimants&mdash;who will do their utmost to get what they can from the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there needs to be a total review of the whole social security system to look at every payment that is made and look at whether it is a successful payment, whether it is easily exploitable, whether it is being abused and whether it is even unnecessary. If such an inquiry were held, I think it would reveal many loopholes, many abuses and a great deal of rorting and would suggest many changes that must be made. I think this is essential, because it is not the government that is the ultimate loser to these cheats, it is the humble Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that the Labor Party will turn a blind eye to the rorting, cheating and exploiting of the system that goes on, because it has deliberately manufactured a welfare class in this nation as its own, and then proceeded to champion the cause of that class. We now have a society where young people have a value system based on self-indulgence, cynicism, lack of respect for authority and the belief that society owes them a living. The Labor Party has tried to manufacture a new generation of voters who stereotypically are aligned to the Labor Party, but worse, in the manufacturing process, the Labor Party has made this generation dependent on the government, so that these people fear work, or the fact that they must earn a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has created a class of people reliant on the taxpayer, and of the view that society owes them a living. I call it&mdash;and as I said at the start, I am going to be fairly frank&mdash;the government tit syndrome. This class which the Labor Party has manufactured has been feeding off the government tit and now cannot be weaned off it. I do not blame young people for this. They are the ones who, through the economic decay caused by state and federal Labor governments, have been deprived of a degree of hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I blame the Labor Party which, through megalomaniacal tendencies, has put its electoral prospects first and, in order to satisfy its need for power, has bred a constituency of its own which is reliant on the welfare system. The Labor Party has this group of people on the government tit, and if it pulls them off the tit, which it can and should very easily do, those people will start crying, as you would expect, and abandon the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last election exposed the Labor Party as being reliant on many of the welfare recipients when its members blatantly lied about the coalition's policies with respect to certain elements of the welfare system. They came out saying that we would cut people off social security after nine months&mdash;a blatant lie. They made allegations about our health policy which were untrue, and they lied their way back into power. When you look at their comments, they simply appealed to those people who were recipients of welfare. They were wrong in what they said, but they found the tactic of suggesting that the coalition would destroy the welfare system to be a very successful one indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am totally supportive of the welfare system. I have nothing against a system that holds out a hand to those who are finding it a struggle to survive from week to week, but I likewise support the Australian taxpayers, the people who pay our wages and fund our welfare system. They are the ones who are cheated when we have the social security cheats, the young homeless allowance cheats, or some other welfare cheats who have been brainwashed by the Labor Party into thinking that society owes them a living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a total revamp of the whole social security system so that, while it provides for those who require and deserve assistance, it is not easy to rort or rip off. The Labor Party is guilty of having created a new welfare class in our society, a constituency all its own. So while the government needs to reform our social security system, it is also incumbent on it to change attitudes to reflect the opinion of the silent majority in our country, and that is that society does not owe people a living. I offer the government a challenge, but I certainly will not hold my breath waiting for it to take it up. </PARA>

That subject has been high on the public agenda for some time, but little has been done to date in the debate to focus attention on the role that is being played by people within the wider community, and particularly by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who, as actors in the health field, have made a dramatic contribution to the improvement of the health status of their own people and have become, in various ways, politically active as a direct result of their involvement in Aboriginal health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay a special tribute to the job that was done and the life that was led by Sally Ross. My words are derived from a eulogy which was delivered by John Ah Kit at the Catholic church in Alice Springs on 2 August. A memorial service was held on the same day, at the same time in the cathedral in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Ross passed away in a road accident on 25 July 1994 whilst doing her job. She was born in Alice Springs and attended school there until she went to Cabra College in Adelaide for high school. But it was as a kid that the woman we came to know and love came into her own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe it is something to do with the Ross family. With 16 brothers and sisters, she learned to stand up for herself from an early age. She learned early on two important things. The first was the importance of family and the mutual support that each and every one of her brothers and sisters deserved and expected, just as she was looked after by the rest of her family. The second thing she learned was to see things clearly and to stand up and fight for what she believed in. This became a hallmark of her life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She came back home to Alice Springs after high school, and was soon involved in work that would touch the lives of many of her country men and women over the following 25 years right across the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1970s Ms Ross worked in a number of very remote desert communities, starting with Papunya in 1971 where she worked as a clerk, eventually taking on many of the responsibilities of town clerk. It was also in this year that she married Gary Cartwright, and young Justin, her first child, was born. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Papunya the family went for a year to Areyonga where she again worked with the local council. Then in 1976, the same year Mischa, her daughter, was born, the family went on to Ali Curung&mdash;or Warrabri as it was known in those days. At Ali Curung she was a jack-of-all-trades, doing anything from clerical work with the council to acting as the community recreation officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was around this time that she developed an interest in what was to become the ruling passion of her life, Aboriginal health. The first work she did in the area was during a stint at Kintore on the Western Australian border, and then later at Docker River, where she started her Associate Diploma in Aboriginal Studies through the University of New England.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Her work at the Kalano Association in Katherine led, after much arguing and fighting with the government on her part, to the establishment of Wurliwurlinjang Health Centre in Katherine in 1983, the first Aboriginal controlled health service in the top end of the Northern Territory. Ms Ross was the first director of Wurliwurlinjang, and the success of the place had much to do with the dedication and passion she brought to the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After another stint in the desert, Ms Ross returned to Katherine where she served as the director of the Aboriginal Institute of Health, which paved the way for training of health workers throughout the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 she was back in the thick of things, starting up yet another health service, this time working with the Anyinginyi Congress in Tennant Creek. She kicked off the health service in Tennant Creek, operating from the old building near the camp on the north side of town. Within two years Congress boasted some of the best facilities in the territory, thanks to the hard work put in by her and the Tennant Creek Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a stint in Katherine, again this time working as a field officer with the Northern Land Council, she took on another battle in the health field, this time in Darwin. Unlike in her home town of Alice Springs, Darwin had never had any Aboriginal controlled health service until Ms Ross hit town and started the job of community consultations and fights with government and bureaucrats. The establishment of the Danila Dilba Health Service was a crowning achievement. It now services 8,000 Aboriginal people in the Darwin area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this, she took the fight to the highest levels of politics in her role as the executive officer of the Tripartite Forum and member of the Aboriginal Health Council. During this period she was also an inaugural member of the Yilli Rreung Regional ATSIC Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year Ms Ross returned to Tennant Creek at the request of the Aboriginal community to take over the reins at Anyinginyi Congress again and to sort out problems the organisation was facing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Ross was at the forefront of working in all the major centres of the territory in the area of Aboriginal health and, in a quarter of a century of work, she achieved many things that were important and vital to the Aboriginal people, including the establishment of three major Aboriginal medical services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Ross had the spirit of a fighter. If there is one thing that she never walked away from, it was a good blue. She would go in boots and all, whether she was straightening up a government bureaucrat or a fellow worker&mdash;or indeed a politician. She was someone who was never afraid to speak her mind and stand strongly for what she believed. Those who have caught the sharp side of her tongue, as I did from time to time over the years, know that more often than not she was right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She never took the easy way out, never took the simple, nine to five jobs where she could put her feet up at the end of the day and watch the pay cheques coming in. She took on the jobs that involved a 24-hour-a-day commitment, the ones that needed a strength and fighting spirit that would win the battles that have to be won against ignorance and prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all this, she honoured her heritage as a strong woman of the Kaytej and Arrernte people. But there was another side to Ms Ross: she also carried with her over those years of struggle her sense of humour. All of us who knew her will treasure the memories of her laugh, her jokes, and of her humour in the face of adversity or in the midst of a struggle. The work that Ms Ross started is not over. It is merely begun. We are all thankful for the foundations that she helped build, in the knowledge that they will be the basis for a better life for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory in the future. I would like to offer my condolences to her family, particularly to Justin and Mischa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to explain the feeling one has for such a person, because not too often in public life does one come in contact with people of such dedication. We often hear in this place recriminations made against Aboriginal people&mdash;wrongly, more often than not&mdash;and about their lack of desire to change or to meet the demands and challenges that confront them in their own lives. Let me put it on the public record that, in my view, that is almost 100 per cent wrong. I have never met an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person working in the field of Aboriginal health who has not made a grave personal sacrifice themselves, and dedicated extreme levels of commitment not only to Aboriginal people but to the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst, in this place, we can often argue about the merits or otherwise of particular policy objectives, and indeed argue&mdash;as we do, from time to time&mdash;about the appropriateness of funding in this direction, what we should not lose sight of is the absolute commitment of people like Ms Ross to the quest for self-determination and self-management and control over their own lives by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is that total commitment which marked Ms Ross as a truly great Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to think that, as the years roll on and we come to reflect upon this current period of our history, we will recognise that debates in this place matter in some respects but that, more often than not, they are not worth a tinker's cuss. What is worth while is the commitment and dedication that a person puts into achieving a better life for others by actually doing things; and Ms Ross was one such person. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Moura is a mining and agricultural centre on the western perimeter of my electorate. It is a pleasant and vibrant town, indicative of those new communities in Central Queensland combining traditional farming practice with one of Australia's most important export industries, coal. In fact, it is not uncommon for families of the farming community to work in the mines. Moura, with 3,000 people, is also the second largest community in the Banana Shire. BHP's mining operations immediately to the south of Moura produce four million tonnes of coal&mdash;600,000 tonnes of which comes from underground operations. Moura, along with the other export mines of Central Queensland, produces 40 per cent of Australia's vital coal exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background of a successful, happy and productive community, the events of Sunday, 7 August stand in stark and horrifying contrast. At 11.35 on that night, there was an explosion in the Moura No. 2 mine which claimed the lives of 11 miners. That evening, two teams of nine were on the shift underground. Another miner and a contractor were working with the team which was trapped. The second team, led by a deputy, put their emergency procedures into practice and, with a combination of good training and leadership, escaped from the mine after the explosion&mdash;which, though some distance away, enveloped them in dust and gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 10th escapee was thrown to the ground just as he entered the mine. Apart from the merciful escape of those 10 miners, the rest of the story is a tragedy to test the hardiest participant or observer. Though some said a rescue should have been attempted earlier, monitoring showed that high levels of gases, including carbon monoxide, and fires would have made a rescue attempt at that stage highly hazardous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By Monday morning a crisis plan was in place and later the experimental Numbat, which many members would have seen on TV, was on its way to the mine. At 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday, a second and massive explosion blew out the ventilation fans and, ironically, this occurred just before the Numbat was to enter the mine. It was followed by two or three smaller explosions. Extensive fires ensued and a significant danger to personnel became evident. A meeting was held of representatives of BHP, the union and government and reluctantly they took the decision to seal the mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can scarcely imagine the trauma this event would have caused for the families of the trapped miners. The doubt, the uncertainty and the ability to properly satiate their grief are all bound up in that one decision. The last lingering doubts and then the horror of knowing their loved ones were entombed for all time are hard enough to comment on, much less live through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who died were John Robert Dullahide, 44, of Moura; Darrell William Hogarth, 46, of Moura; David Brian King, 24, of Banana; Geoffrey Mazzer, 45, of Biloela; Mark Reginald Nelson, 36, of Moura; Robert Alan Newton, 39, of Banana; Robert Parker, 39, of Newcastle; Christopher Robert Ritchie, 27, of Moura; Michael Edward Ryan, 31, of Moura; Michael Edward Shaw, 27, of Moura; and Terry Gordon Vivian, 49, of Moura. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the families of these miners I extend my deepest sympathy and that, I am sure, of all members of this House. I commend Bob Flew of BHP and Andrew Vickers of the United Mine Workers Union for their professionalism, and the local union representative, Toby Dittman, for his excellent arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the scene at Moura: by Tuesday night a sense of resignation had descended on the town and the first of a series of memorial masses was held. An Anglican Eucharist, which my wife and I attended, was held on Wednesday morning. On Friday the grief of the whole community poured out in an open-air service attended by upwards of 3,000 people. Ironically, the service was held in the shadow of the hall built as a memorial to the victims of the 1975 Kianga mine disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scarcely a person in the town or district was not touched in some way by the tragedy: family, extended family, client, patient, parishioner, club or sporting colleague. One professional man lost eight of his clients and will now have the sad and onerous task of representing their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local and visiting clergy, including the Bishop of Rockhampton, local citizens and mining union officials participated in the service. In a rare act of bipartisanship, the Premier and the state Leader of the Opposition attended together, while the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), whose condolences were offered in this House yesterday, and the shadow minister for resources, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), flew in together. Mining union officials, BHP representatives and other industry representatives stood side by side in prayer and tribute. They included Brian Loton, John Prescott, Bob Flew, John Maitland, Andrew Vickers and Michael Pinnock&mdash;to name just a few. The presence of the Mayor, Barry Rideout, councillors and former councillors of the Banana Shire, and state members, including Mrs Di McCauley, whose husband and son have both been miners, emphasised the local sense of loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, a cheap shot is always the easy shot. I will not be part of that regime, nor, however, do I feel constrained in making a number of personal observations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is scarcely possible that one community could suffer three such eventualities in the short space of 19 years. Thirteen died in the Kianga mine near Moura in 1975, 12 in the Moura No. 4 mine in 1986, and 11 in the Moura No. 2 mine in 1994. I accept that a number of regions such as Kembla and the southern Bowen Basin, in which Moura is located, are gassy, volatile mine areas and that considerable research has gone into safety. I appreciate that there will be a mining warden's inquiry held in October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I feel compelled to say that a wider ranging inquiry involving operational and safety aspects of all underground mining should follow the mining warden's report. This is in no way to reflect on the competence of the warden, but we should look searchingly at underground mining across Australia. Governments should play a significant part in financing such an inquiry and the subsequent research that such an inquiry might reasonably recommend. The industry, initially through the national energy research development and demonstration program, and later through the Australian Coal Association research program, has contributed $1.7 million to Numbat research, with approximately 25 per cent of it from BHP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but observe that development would be enhanced by an injection of federal government funding, first to advance this unit beyond the experimental to the operational stage and then, if this can be achieved successfully, to fund the strategic placement of a number of these units in key mining areas. I must also echo the words of the shadow minister for resources in saying that no effort should be spared across Australia in improving mine safety. These tragedies come back periodically to haunt us and to tell us that we have not done enough. I say that without apportioning blame or condemnation to anyone, but as an appeal to government to take this matter in hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few minutes remaining to me I would like to make another appeal. Although all salary and superannuation entitlements are being paid to the family, the company sponsored death and disablement insurance policies have been paid, and the death benefits will be paid shortly under workers compensation entitlements, we have the problem of common law claims dragging on and on. It is a sad fact of life that the victims of the 1986 disaster have not yet been paid for their common law claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it behoves us, when you think of the great finality of a mine disaster, to simplify the procedures so that these people can have justice. Certainly, the families will have very generous superannuation payments at times; certainly, the families will have company payments; certainly, the families will have workers compensation payments; but without that final common law payment how can the widow, the mother of those children, plan their future, plan their education and make the decision about whether they live on in Moura, or whatever the town might be, or move to a capital city? I make these appeals to the government. Again, I offer my sincere condolences to the families, to the community of Moura and to the mining union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I join the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in expressing my condolences to the families, relatives and friends of the people who passed away in the disaster in Moura. My electorate base is in the city of Ipswich, and I am sure that in passing on those condolences I speak on behalf of all the people in my electorate who have faced similar tragedies in their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) in the chamber at the moment because, as the honourable member for Hinkler rightly said, he attended with the others referred to. That has certainly been a great tragedy for the mining industry, and particularly for the town of Moura, which I have visited on one occasion as well. I join the honourable member for Hinkler, and I think it is good that he has raised that issue in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to move to another point which also revolves around the generosity of Australians when it comes to crises. I know there has been a great response to the tragedy at Moura, but Australians also respond to crises around the world. Australians have always been prepared and ready to respond to the needs of those who are much less fortunate than ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly make reference to the generous response by the Australian government and people to the need to assist the people of Rwanda. It just shows that Australians are people who really do care about their fellow human beings. I am sure all members of this place have been involved somewhere in their own communities and have noticed, through their own churches and community organisations, the generous response that has come forward. I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution by all those people who do respond in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, when it comes to the question of foreign aid, we often have some criticism out there in the community where people tend to say that we should not be giving aid overseas when we have problems at home. We do not live in a perfect world but, when we see tragedies like Rwanda, I think people in Australia really do see the merit in governments responding and providing in the budget for an ongoing foreign aid process. Of course, it often does not receive the debate that it really deserves in this place. We talk about many other issues that grab headlines, but I do not think that this issue often receives the attention it deserves. I think it is a very important area that we often overlook. Those who have had the opportunity to travel overseas and see what Australia does in the foreign aid area would agree that we can be justly proud of the contributions that we actually have made over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case of Rwanda shows the need for us to respond on an ongoing basis, not just to respond when the crises arise. I think we need to have an ongoing commitment to helping those who are less fortunate than ourselves. We in Australia have for many years had the safety net to provide assistance to families on an ongoing basis, and that is something that I think we often take for granted when we see those in other parts of the world who really do live in dreadful conditions. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I are involved in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. We certainly do have to respond to the needs of people at home, particularly our indigenous people. We are responding to that, the resources are there, but we can always do things better in assisting our indigenous people, as you and I both know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the foreign aid question, particularly in this International Year of the Family, I think we should give real consideration to the concept of family and neighbourhood. In this rapidly changing world, where countries can be in constant contact, where communications are better now than ever before, where does the concept of neighbourhood actually end? That is what we really need to look at when we are looking at communication with our neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does our responsibility to our global family fit into the equation? Time and again Australians have shown themselves to be some of the most generous people in the world, and I congratulate them again for their efforts over recent weeks. From the recent drought relief charity drives in both your state and mine, Mr Deputy Speaker, to our involvement in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia and Cambodia, Australians will never turn their backs on those in need. But trying to do this is a particularly hard task for any government. We have to do it in pursuing the sense of responsible global family. If we do not involve ourselves in the trouble spots of the world, we can hardly call ourselves responsible world citizens, and I think we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see the increase in our level of commitment to Rwanda once it became apparent that the situation had deteriorated. The government committed $3.5 million in humanitarian aid originally and followed this up with a further $6.5 million on 25 July, a total of $10 million. This was criticised by some sections of the community for not being generous enough&mdash;and we can always be critical of there not being enough&mdash;but I think we must go a bit further and look at what some commentators ignored. That was the fact that the defence assistance provided by Australia is costing approximately $25 million. In addition, I would like to remind the House of the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) just last week in Townsville when he farewelled the troops going to Rwanda. He said that, with all the foreign commitments the ADF has around the world at the present time, Australia now has more nurses serving overseas than at any time since the Vietnam War. I think that is a great commitment by our nursing staff in the ADF. Just recently the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) was in my electorate and we were speaking to some defence people at the Amberley Air Force base in relation to this, and some of those people have actually had their names put on that list to go over there, and they were keen to go and to do their bit for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate there is a nurse, Karen Harmon, who has gone to Rwanda. She was working with the West Morton Regional Health Authority in my electorate. She is very experienced in the health area and she is actually over there in Rwanda at the present time. It is good to see people that you actually know making that sort of commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of Australia's foreign aid is provided in the form of development cooperation projects, and that is important from our point of view. It is by far the best form of aid because it allows people in less developed countries to take some control of their own destiny. It helps them find solutions to the problems which have hindered them in the past. Development cooperation places a focus on the ability and the responsibility of aid recipients to look after themselves. I think that is the most practical sort of aid that we as a nation can give. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's future is shaped strongly by our geography, which is often referred to here. That prompts us to alter our focus on aid a little to make sure that the Asia-Pacific region has a priority in aid decisions. If we look at the last budget, Australia's total development cooperation budget was $1,486 million, with those projects specifically targeting development in the South-East Asia region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to highlight the way the government has failed those working in medical research and, as a consequence, the longer term good health of all Australians. Researchers have to go begging to charities, and not only to charities. Recently, an Australian researcher applied for a United States grant on the basis that Australia is a Third World country in terms of funding for medical research, and he was successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Commission for Health Research and Development recommends that even developing countries should spend a minimum of two per cent of their health budget on research, and Australia spends about half that. Prior to the last election the government made a commitment to increase medical research funding to two per cent of the health budget by the year 2000. In the budget speech, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a step towards the Prime Minister's election commitment of lifting health and medical research, an additional $93 million is being made available for research over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA>This claim is dishonest. Studies by Access Economics and the Australian Institute for Health and Welfare undermine the government's claims. Using the government's own budget figures and forward estimates, both studies indicate that, rather than increasing direct government spending on medical research, it will actively decrease from just under one per cent of our health outlays at the moment to 0.83 per cent by 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has committed $667.4 million over the next four years to health and medical research. However, if spending on health and medical research were sustained as a proportion of the total health spending on the 1993-94 rate, the total would have to be $716.5 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, spending on health and medical research in the four years has declined by almost $50 million, or $12 million per year. While the National Health and Medical Research Council will receive a small increase in funding this year, the government has directly committed $3 million over three years to establish a breast cancer research foundation which the public will be invited to make contributions to. In two ways this smacks of political opportunism: the wife of the Prime Minister is the chairperson, and the role of the National Health and Medical Research Council is diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of the people who have argued and lobbied for an increase in funding for breast cancer research. However, I am also on the record in this place as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not arguing for sectional interest and do not suggest that less should be spent on other areas of medical research. We should not reallocate existing resources but rather increase Australia's overall investment in medical research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult not to see the foundation as an attempt to politically undermine the distribution of research moneys on the basis of peer review, scientific validity and the determination of priorities based on Australia's research within an international context and the needs of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be argued that we do not need to do medical research but could just make use of what is done in other countries. This is a false argument. The fact is that for the good of all Australians we need to have a seat at the international table so that we know what is going on where the bulk of the world's research is done. The price of admission to this table is for us to do quality research to bring to the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we spend $33 billion annually treating ill health; the direct funding through the National Health and Medical Research Council is only $125 million. Although Professor Forbes was referring specifically to breast cancer research when giving public evidence to the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the management and treatment of breast cancer, his evidence could well have applied to medical research generally. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we have not got the data correct, the information and education programs are worthless. If we have not got the data correct, we are punching smog with our treatment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research is asking questions and trying to obtain new knowledge. It is also producing ideas and concepts and testing them to see whether they are true and when you make mistakes you develop new ideas to replace the previous concept.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not difficult to conclude that good clinical research is really measuring outcomes. Wise investment in medical research means savings on expenditure on ill health. If we continue with an open chequebook style, we could be doing all the wrong things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The true costs of ill health are much greater than the aggregate expenditure on health would indicate. Indirect costs due to loss of productivity and earnings can be equally high. Annual costs of individual disorders are typically 100-fold greater than investment in research in the same direction.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, even small gains resulting from research readily repay the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the budget, Dr Christine Clarke, who is the President of the Australian Society for Medical Research, commented on the hoax of the supposed additional funding of $93 million, or $23 million annually over the four years. She pointed out that a significant proportion of this funding had been found by resurrecting existing spending of $14 million a year from a program due to end in June. She said that that only left $9 million in new funding, most of which was needed to keep existing programs running. She added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It doesn't get us any closer to the Government's election promise of lifting research funding to two per cent by the Year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>When questioned by Kerry O'Brien she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately it is not going to fund any new research at all.</PARA>
<PARA>And we are meant to be the clever country placing so much emphasis on educating people! Professor Priscilla Kincaid-Smith, from the Department of Medicine at the University of Melbourne, also was interviewed by Kerry O'Brien. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think one of the saddest things at the present time is Christine Clarke's remark that no new projects will be successfully funded because for a senior researcher that is one of the saddest things of all to see new, young, eager, very capable, very intelligent research workers fail to get funding because of the present system.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brendan Nelson, President of the Australian Medical Association, claims that what the federal government will commit to medical research this year equates approximately to the cost to Medicare of an influenza outbreak. The government has failed to recognise that the reason for medical research is primarily to lead to increases in the good health of all Australians. With resources stretched, there are projects which are uniquely Australian, such as Aboriginal health, or partly Australian, such as childhood asthma or melanoma, which have the highest prevalence in this country, that will be lost because that research will not be done elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is being short-sighted. When our scientists go overseas, it is difficult to get them back to an unpredictable environment. There will also be additional costs. As Dr Clarke puts it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is important to emphasise too that if we don't do research in this country, the cost of our health care is going to increase, perhaps not today but definitely tomorrow, because every discovery we don't make here we will have to buy back from overseas.</PARA>
<PARA>The government makes long-term planning for the good of all Australians a low priority. All too often it seems that there is a one-election-to-another mentality. We need some long-term vision. We are still a most fortunate country. Australia must take its place in the world in areas such as medical research. We should be ashamed of being considered Third World in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I have been able to meet with health ministers in Zimbabwe and Botswana and to visit the Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana, where I spoke with a specialist physician, a specialist surgeon and also a paediatrician. They talk of the problems of HIV/AIDS and the high incidence of infection. There are estimates that 25 per cent of the sexually active population is HIV positive and that in some communities the figure is as high as 35 per cent. These countries should be able to look to Australia for assistance, expertise and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from any humanitarian consideration, these days, with changing immigration patterns, we cannot afford to say that these problems should not concern us. We need well-qualified and dedicated researchers with adequate funding and planning as we look forward to the year 2000, and not just the next election. In conclusion, I do not believe I can do better than finish by quoting Dr Christine Clarke:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the Minister's belief that there is not a crisis is wrong. There is a crisis that will manifest, if not next year then the year after. The situation is desperate and must be resolved with a major increase in funding, and we need not only the private sector but the Government to contribute because the private sector will not substitute for Government investment in research.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to record my concern for and condolences to the community of Moura in response to the tragedy of the mine disaster. I acknowledge the reference to it made by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) in question time yesterday and also that made by my colleague the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) in his speech today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister indicated in question time yesterday, the coal industry is worth $7.5 billion in exports. But, as the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 9 August said, it is also the mining industry's No. 1 killer. We have to face the fact that this is a very dangerous occupation. Until the most recent disaster, which has once again afflicted the community of Moura, following the two previous disasters there, this century there had been 262 fatalities, as reported in the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, with the biggest toll of 94 occurring in 1902 after an explosion in the mine at Mount Kembla in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although unreported, five coalminers were killed last year in separate incidents&mdash;three above ground in open-cut operations and two underground. While the fatality rate and the injury rate have improved since 1986-87, we still have a very serious problem to deal with. Both federal and state governments, together with the mining industry, coal owners and unions will have to do a great deal more work on this issue. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> noted in its article on 9 August:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the fatality rate of mining has fallen 40 per cent since 1986/87, mining jobs are still four times more dangerous than those in Australian industry in general.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, we do not compare particularly favourably with the United States and Canada. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1986/87, the mining industry has averaged 30 deaths per year, with the lowest total, 19, in the last year for which figures are available, 1992/93, of which three were in underground coal mines.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to prejudge the inquiry, which will take place in Moura, but we have to be very mindful of the fact that, in the aftermath of a disaster, the next stage of trauma for the families will be the necessary inquiry. A number of experts and people from all over the country making comments and calling for greater safety can further traumatise the victims. In this case, where there was a very large number of deaths, the whole community was involved. The victims have families and friends. Mining communities are very close. Other family members in the community are often involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the mining communities in the Bowen Basin will have been affected, because many of the workers in other coalmining communities have moved around the area and been at different mines. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, they have even worked in the coalmines in your electorate. Many of the mine workers and their families in other mining communities will feel very personally affected. They have shown that impact by their attendance at the memorial services. I place on the record my inability to be at the memorial services due to my parliamentary commitments. But I have communicated with the mining union officials at the state and national levels and will be arranging to visit at an appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Having worked in the industry and having counselled people who have been involved in serious mine accidents and the families of miners who have been killed, I am only too personally aware of the trauma, grief, anger and feeling of impotence that affects people in this situation. In my coalmining town of Middlemount, the unions and management worked very hard on developing disaster responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did a lot of work to prepare for such circumstances. That is not to say that we can avoid those circumstances happening. But the community needs to have a very effective response, because certainly with past disasters in Moura there has been a great deal of anger at the intrusion of outsiders. The press has not always been responded to positively because of apparent insensitivities. However, it is true to say that the press is attempting to convey to the rest of the country what is happening. But the need to know needs to be balanced with a sensitivity and respect for the circumstances that the community is dealing with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is very important to understand that both management and the unions are particularly concerned about safety issues when coalminers go underground every day. In a sense, one has to suspend that cognitive reference to disaster when driving through the fire doors. I remember the first time I went down an underground mine. When the fire doors closed behind me, I realised that I was in another world. I had to adapt to those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, if the ventilation system breaks down&mdash;as it did when I was underground at one stage&mdash;the air becomes much heavier, there is much more dust and it gets hotter. Walking through the returns with one of the safety officers and seeing the readings of the methane gas, one realises the very volatile and unfriendly environment there. But miners and their families have to deal with this every day. In a sense, at a psychological level, they have to put that aside. At the same time, they have to be very conscious of the need for safety in an environment that is often dark and noisy, where there is heavy machinery and where one will be walking through sludge and so on. It is a very difficult environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one of the reasons for the industrial position of the coalmining unions at the moment in relation to coal marketing and the CIT is that they want the particular dangers and circumstances of their industry to be recognised. This is a challenge for the government, the unions and the coal owners. The state and federal governments must address the issue of mine safety and ensure that adequate funding goes into research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns have been expressed in the media and by people who feel that a number of the recommendations that were made following the previous investigations into previous disasters at Moura have not been fully implemented. There is a responsibility on all of us to make sure that these concerns are addressed. It is important that there be an independent inquiry, however due process occurs. I would certainly support the member for Hinkler in his call for a wider-ranging inquiry across the country. Once again, I place on record my concern and distress for the families of those who have lost loved ones in the latest disaster at Moura. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would hate to guess how many column centimetres have been written over the past few days in our good quality newspapers about the Hilmer report and last week's COAG meeting. We have heard much about the value of competition policy and much about the obstinacy and parochialism of various premiers but precious little about what is surely one of the key issues in this debate: the various roles and responsibilities that the different levels of government have in our federation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this was happening at the end of the week when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hawke Memoirs</EMPHASIS> was launched. I do not intend to publicise Mr Hawke's book here&mdash;he seems to have the Nine Network at his disposal to do that&mdash;but it is ironic to note that it was only four years ago when, as Prime Minister, Hawke stood in this very chamber and spoke of the need to fashion a new federalism, an aim that was deliberately sabotaged by the backbench member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) as part of his campaign for the leadership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably worth reminding ourselves of the path Hawke followed in his views on federalism. In his 1979 Boyer lectures, Hawke argued that Australia was overgoverned and that the federal system was terminally inefficient. As a solution, he suggested that the state governments be abolished and be replaced by regional governments based on amalgamations of local councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hawke's lectures caused a minor stir before political reality struck. The sort of change he was proposing would require a rewrite of the constitution&mdash;a possibility, given the nation's record of rejecting almost all proposed constitutional amendments, so remote it could be considered only a political fantasy. So in 1990, as Prime Minister, Hawke said, `We cannot rewrite the constitution, we cannot replace the federal system, but we can make the constitution and the federal system under which we live and work better than it now is.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth remembering that much of the drive for the stance Hawke advocated had come from a Liberal, the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner. It is certainly worth remembering that much of the cooperative spirit that existed in those days was destroyed by the current Prime Minister in his campaign to secure the top job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the Special Premiers Conferences of the early 1990s and the work COAG has achieved, similar attitudes to those expressed by Hawke in 1979 are still strong. There is a real recognition that, despite all of the complaints we hear of Australia being undergoverned, we cannot realistically expect to see the abolition of a level of government. Instead, we believe that we have to make the current system work. We have to clearly delineate the functions that should be performed at each of the three levels of government&mdash;by the federal government, the state governments and local government&mdash;and what taxation policies they should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990-91, when there was much discussion over the Greiner-Hawke new federalism, it was popular to compare Australia with the European Community. It was said that in 1992 there would be fewer regulatory restrictions and less duplication of services between the 12 member nations of the EC than between the six states making up the one country of Australia, despite a centenary of federation. It was pointed out that investors now also had unlimited choice as to where they would invest their capital and had the means to uplift their capital and move it to another jurisdiction almost at will, making it difficult for any Australian government&mdash;federal or state&mdash;to tax capital or to regulate it more heavily than in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads me back to the Hilmer report and to the current buzz words of national competition policy. This side of the House fully supports moves towards a national competition policy. Unlike the Prime Minister, however, we also recognise the work that the state and territory governments are doing to achieve micro reform at their level. It should come as no surprise that the person who torpedoed the new relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in 1991 should now be locked in a log jam with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that the states will benefit in the long term through the policy direction outlined in the Hilmer report. Limited though their revenue bases may be, stronger economic growth will add more money to their coffers while asset sales will benefit the debt servicing component of state budgets. Hilmer will lead to a bigger national economic take and I am sure few people would dispute this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recognise the advantages of competition policy reform and I am sure that most people, despite the noises made by some commentators, realise that efforts towards a national competition policy have not been derailed by the failure of last week's COAG meeting. Earlier this week, Professor Hilmer wrote of the inevitability of a national competition policy. He rightly pointed out that competition policy starts to bite as soon as it is widely believed to be coming. Professor Hilmer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The clear signal drives reform because managers and other decision makers don't make decisions on the basis of today's market structures and laws but rather on their views as to what markets and laws will be like in the future. It is the expectation of competition policy as much as the resolve of governments to lift performance of their enterprises that has underpinned the already considerable progress in many areas ranging from utilities to transport, banking and communications.</PARA>
<PARA>If the COAG process collapses, the alternative will be policy formulation conflict, not intergovernmental agreement. We all know of the financial, economic and political costs of this approach yet, by its stance over Hilmer, the government is embarking on a course that could damage the political position of state governments while threatening the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states have restricted revenue bases. To make up losses they may suffer as a result of competition reform, they may have to rely on costly and inefficient forms of taxation. If issues of compensation, funding and revenue are not resolved states will be put under great pressure to put up taxes and charges, releasing a whole new range of inflationary pressures. This whole process will be entirely undesirable&mdash;politically and economically. COAG is the best method we have available at the moment to adjust the current pressures on our federation and to make it work better. The dispute over the Hilmer report shows just how far we still have to go in finetuning that federation before it can deliver the economic change Australia needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has always been clear that, if the states want more money and freedom on how to spend it, they need the courage to be accountable, to be prepared to say publicly how their own enterprises, like railways and buses, are performing. In New South Wales, the state government has been asking its managers for better performance to maintain dividend streams and lower prices for more than half a decade, and other states have followed its lead. The states are already delivering significant competition reform. It is time for the government to adopt a less centralist attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer committee was advised that the Commonwealth, under the constitutional powers it has to make laws with respect to corporations, may be able to make laws to cover people and organisations dealing with or competing against corporations. This power is yet to be tested in the High Court. We only hope that the matter can be resolved by the government taking a less confrontationist approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hilmer committee did not stem from a joint Commonwealth-state initiative. Instead it was announced unilaterally by the Prime Minister after negotiations on a joint inquiry broke down in 1992. It was only later acceded to by the premiers. Gary Sturgess, a former Greiner adviser, commented yesterday that Hilmer's recommendations have been unnecessarily insensitive on the subject of intergovernmental relations. He pointed to the close linkages the states saw between competition policy and the rest of the new federalism, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending a National Competition Council which is unrelated to the Council of Australian Governments, Hilmer has chosen a process which separates the different elements of the Commonwealth-State agenda.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The underlying problem is one which the states have been warning the Commonwealth about since the very outset of the Hawke-Greiner new federalism process: the states cannot afford, financially or politically, to have the reform agenda fragmented with all the pain upfront and the benefits delivered, if at all, only in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Commonwealth was offering last week was more pain with nothing more than the promise of political trade offs and real compensation in return . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We currently have a government that is seized with a republican millennium fever, yet it was decided to ignore some of the real problems of our federation. If the Prime Minister really wants his place in history, here is a reform he could make. Gary Sturgess finished by saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to speak about north-eastern Tasmania, specifically the area around Derby, and also about the local community near Derby, who are dealing with the chemical Atrazine in their water supply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Atrazine is a chemical which is used to control weeds in plantation and cropping areas. The chemical kills the weeds by preventing the process of photosynthesis. Atrazine is used in forestry operations prior to planting and again after planting if any weeds appear. The product has a history of being used throughout the world for such purposes. However, a number of countries have now either banned its use or severely curtailed its application in water catchment areas. Only this year, it has been banned in Denmark and Austria. It is banned in Germany, its use has been discontinued in Scandinavia, and its sale has been suspended in Italy. Atrazine is a chemical which does not break down readily and has been classified as a type 2B carcinogen. It also has the potential to adversely affect the human reproductive system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of north-eastern Tasmania in my electorate of Bass are to be commended for the action that they have taken to protect their own health and the health of their children. At a public meeting at the RSL club rooms in Scottsdale on 4 August, the following motion was passed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We call on the Dorset council to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the municipality's drinking water supplies are free from pesticide contamination. We also call upon the council to demand of state parliament a total ban on the use of pesticides within drinking water supply catchment areas and to call for the state parliament to implement an immediate moratorium on pesticide applications until the issue is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that the Dorset council has acted very well in the interests of its ratepayers on this issue. The council has called for a moratorium on the use of Atrazine in water catchment areas and has generally called on the state government to ensure that drinking water is free of all contaminants as a matter of principle. The people of the Dorset council and the people of north-eastern Tasmania are exactly right: clean drinking water is a matter of principle. Access to safe, clean, uncontaminated water is something that we all take for granted. We are constantly witness to chemicals being liberally plied to our lands and our crops, with very little consideration of the consequences down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The testing being done on the water supply in Derby shows that the level of Atrazine is well below the level accepted by the World Health Organisation. This is very good. However, it must be realised that confidence in one's drinking water is a very important thing. Many people do not accept any risk as being an acceptable risk. There are people in Derby who, rather than drinking the mains water supply, travel significant distances to collect their water from pure streams. They simply will accept no risk, and why should they? I commend the people of Derby and the people of north-eastern Tasmania for the action that they have taken. All persons should consider exactly what it is that they are drinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the Forestry Commission of Tasmania for the very professional way in which it has handled the problem. The Forestry Commission is the organisation which used the chemical in the area. The outcry and the attitude of the people of north-eastern Tasmania have stimulated the Forestry Commission to place a state-wide moratorium on the use of Atrazine for the rest of this year. </PARA>

As well the health inspector from the local council tests the water supply twice a week. Furthermore, the Forestry Commission has undertaken a three-year research program at a cost of $200,000 to investigate alternative weed control. This entire saga shows something that we all should never lose sight of: a local community does have the right and the obligation to stand up and determine its own living conditions, what risks it will accept and what risks it will not accept.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Justice. As the minister would be aware, an evaluation of the operation of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991 was undertaken late last year and a report was produced. Given the importance to the community and to business of a strong and effective bankruptcy act, can the minister outline the findings of the review and the relevance to business operations in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RH4">Mr KERR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the introduction of the Bankruptcy Amendment Act 1991, which came into effect on 1 July 1992, the government undertook a review of its effectiveness. That was because at the time of its introduction there had been some concerns from practitioners in the area as to how it might operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the reason why the amendment legislation was introduced is that there was considerable community concern that fraudulent bankrupts were being able to take advantage of loopholes in the bankruptcy act and to escape their responsibilities whilst honest but unfortunate bankrupts were unable to have efficient discharge of their responsibilities and were going through protracted processes before they were able to achieve a discharge of their bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the major objectives of the amendments, which were known generally as the Skase amendments, were as follows. The first was to introduce a new regime of compulsory contributions for bankrupts from their income so that income streams would be taken into account. The second was to introduce substantial new powers to give official receivers powers of greater investigative capacity, to allow them to be better able to seek information and better able to access the resources and assets of bankrupts for the benefit of bankrupt estates. The third was a reformed regime for discharge for bankruptcies, allowing early discharge for bankrupts who were honest but unfortunate whilst at the same time allowing prolonged bankruptcy in the case of those against whom reasonable suspicions could be had that they were seeking fraudulently to avoid payment to their creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time these amendments were passed there was significant opposition from some practitioners. Senator Tate, the minister who introduced those provisions, undertook to have a review of them after they had been in operation for some time. As a result, questionnaires have been mailed to a wide variety of those involved in the industry. I am pleased to say that an analysis of the results of that questionnaire shows that there is now very substantial widespread support for the reforms, including from private insolvency practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The review found that the amendments have been effective in both improving collections from bankrupts and increasing returns to creditors. They have also been effective in their intention to allow bankrupts early discharge where they are able to show, with the stringent disqualification and eligibility criteria, that they are proper candidates for early discharge. A copy of this report, which contains a comprehensive evaluation of the responses, is available through the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This is a pretty significant review of the operations of the Bankruptcy Act. It is an initiative which has little precedent. I believe it is the first time that the effectiveness of the bankruptcy system has been reviewed in such a way. Its success shows that there is some merit in considering it on future occasions to ensure the continued good operation of the system. I am sure that if that is the case and the department does follow such moves, it would have the widespread support of this House.</PARA>

That is about three years out. Nevertheless, the government's deficit reduction target remains in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members will be aware, the pharmaceutical benefits schedule is a very important part of the universal Medicare scheme available in this country. Obviously, the government is keen to reduce the cost of pharmaceuticals to consumers. A major element in our policy is clearly to encourage brand substitution where that is possible. At the moment, that is severely restricted. We are moving to ensure that in the future consumers will have an opportunity to have brand substitution at the level of pharmacy. The pharmacists will be able to see whether generic substitution is possible and to arrange for a drug to be substituted for the one that may have been prescribed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important for members to recognise that the doctor continues to have a right of veto if he or she believes that there are reasonable circumstances under which that substitution should not occur. In any case, these generic brands have to go through the same process of assessment as patented brands. It is very important that honourable members realise that consumers are to be well protected under this extension of the pharmacy scheme to allow for generic substitution. These changes will be introduced late this year.

Would the minister tell us, at the same time, why she continues to pretend that provider agreements are the answer to the decline in private health insurance when evidence, sited by Mrs Tehan, the Victorian Minister for Health Services, demonstrates that provider agreements which have existed in that state for some time have not arrested the decline?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Capricornia for her question. As honourable members would be aware, the new home child-care allowance comes into effect from 29 September this year and it replaces the with child rate of the dependent spouse rebate. This represents a major structural reform to the system of assistance to families in this country. Contrary to a number of preposterous claims by the opposition, it does not represent a sleight of hand by the government; in fact, not only does it represent delivery in full of our election promise but also it exceeds our election promise in quite significant respects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are the beneficiaries of this change? About 800,000 families will benefit from the increase in the general rate. The home child-care allowance is worth $5 more a fortnight than the old with child dependent spouse rebate. Some 55,000 families whose incomes were insufficient for them to benefit fully from the operation of a tax rebate because they did not have sufficient taxable income will benefit to the tune of up to $60 a fortnight. Around 120,000 families where the carer moves in and out of the work force will benefit from the added flexibility of the system. If, for example, somebody leaves the work force they will be able to go straight on to the home child-care allowance instead of having to wait until the end of the financial year for a tax reconciliation. The benefits are very substantial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the bottom line? The bottom line is that this measure costs some $230 million more than the old dependent spouse rebate. So the opposition spokesman's claims that we are working some kind of sleight of hand is absolutely demonstrably absurd. We are providing an additional $230 million in assistance to families over and above that provided by the old with child rate of dependent spouse rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members have scoured through this matter and have tried to come up with some cases where somebody might possibly be worse off. They have focused on a number of issues, such as the difference in the definition of `income' between the Social Security Act and the tax act. A small number of people will be affected by that; they will suffer a slight loss. That loss is massively outweighed by the gains from the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contrast what we are doing in this area with what the former Fraser government did when it did something rather similar. It brought in the family allowance to replace the old dependent child tax rebate. That substitution was done with a zero net budgetary impact in the long term&mdash;not $230 million extra for families. But worse than that, there was no indexation of that payment for the remaining part of the life of the Fraser government which, in effect, produced a $250 million a year saving by the end of the Fraser government's term of office. That is the reality. In other words, it was a substantial real cut. This non-indexation was done in the context of double digit inflation. There is a pretty sharp contrast there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Attorney-General aware of reports that Peter Faris QC has effectively been blackballed by the Victorian Bar Council? What is the impact of this on Commonwealth prosecutions in which he is involved? What is the significance for reform of the legal profession generally?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="216" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Peter Faris QC is an extremely experienced criminal advocate in this country. He has been in the past and is still often briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions to conduct criminal prosecutions for the Commonwealth. After some 24 years as a member of the Victorian bar, Mr Faris left the bar and now practises as a solicitor. The Victorian bar operates a so-called boycott rule, whereby members of the bar are not to appear in cases with non-members. In the past the bar has given certain exemptions to the application of this rule. However, recently a junior who was briefed to appear with Mr Faris applied to the Victorian Bar Council for an exemption, and that application was refused.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This obviously is a matter which the Commonwealth views very seriously. In fairness to the Victorian bar, it has reformed a range of rules and practices which I think could be very fairly described as anti-competitive and designed to protect the interests of the bar rather than the public. It has revised a range of those rules, but this rule remains in force. Fortunately to date it has not impacted greatly on the particular prosecution in hand, but if there is a general application of this boycott to Mr Faris by the Victorian bar it will greatly limit the legitimate choice by the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions of whom it selects to argue cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings home very clearly the need for genuine competition rules to apply to the professions, particularly the legal profession. That is something the profession itself says it strongly believes, and I understand the Victorian government says it strongly believes it. It was somewhat ironic at last Friday's meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to find that apparently the Victorian Premier expressed the greatest opposition to the idea of the Trade Practices Act applying to the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently it was argued by the Victorians at that time that the application of uniform competition rules would disadvantage Victoria inasmuch as it would be the lowest common denominator and they wanted to go further in terms of applying competition principles. Here is a perfect case in point: an application of a rule which I do not believe can be justified in the public interest; a clearly uncompetitive rule designed to guarantee the monopoly of the bar. I call on the Victorian bar to reconsider its position on this individual case, but I also call on the Victorian government to reconsider its opposition to the application of competition policy to the legal profession. I believe the profession as a whole accepts the need for competition policy, and it should not be frustrated by stupid arguments about states rights.</PARA>

One would think that fact would have slipped into his consciousness some time down the track and been incorporated into his argument about where the government was going with this year's budget. If he had wanted to, he could have concentrated on subsequent years, but it was slipped in there. </PARA>

It is not that he is without intelligence; it is just that he is without bottom. He does not want to work. There is no coherence in anything he does except when making childish, student debating points. School was the last occasion in his political life when he achieved anything, albeit on our side of politics when he was at it. He has been trading on that time to gain a reputation in national politics ever since. We on this side of the House do not share in that reputation. </PARA>

One of the options is that we ought to sell leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As commonsense might suggest, this was not a product of some concern about what would be a factional attitude in the Labor Party but a commonsense approach as to what will produce the best return.

If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knew anything about the subject, he would not have  stated that as a point of confusion and he would not have bothered to make the point in this debate. The fact that he does not know anything about the subject means that he got led down the path. </PARA>

He criticised their salary levels in relation to that job. Those salary levels were set by the Remuneration Tribunal on the basis of its understanding of what would be paid to somebody in the private sector who was associated with the sorts of processes in which Mr Neville Wran and the others will engage in determining where we should go with ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a criticism of that, let us see some consistency in the Liberal Party. Let us see him start to make a major campaign point about the level of remuneration in consultancies and for chief executives and others in the private sector. If he wants to say that they are paid vastly more than they deserve to be paid, which is indeed vastly more than what the average Australian receives, he should start saying it across the board. He should not rock in here with these snide asides about a person who has now established himself as a very effective business person. This individual is operating not simply just with governments of both political hues but with the private sector generally. A great deal of confidence resides in him because he has good commonsense and commercial knowledge. </PARA>

Show a bit of guts and nous. Take his friend Mr Kroger. Consider what these people receive from their consultancies and whether or not they are being paid too much.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another sign of weakness in the opposition, I suppose, is its decision to play on a topic about government strength. It obviously decided to come in here to talk about ANL. The last great furphy of the many great furphies in the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;and the last great furphy in his speech that I think I will bother to pick up on&mdash;suggested that this was somehow, in order and dimension, related to the sorts of problems that states experienced with their banking and insurance offices and other GBEs in the latter part of the 1980s.

There is no comparison whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To tell a government that achieved $2.5 billion worth of assets sales last year that it somehow does not know how to operate a privatisation agenda, to tell a government which has put in place such massive reforms, including both the privatisation and corporatisation of the defence industries, and made savings in the defence budget of something like $350 million a year, which has made it possible for us to put in place a most substantial defence equipment procurement program in a period of steady or declining defence budgets&mdash;the government has achieved at Williamstown naval dockyard, for example, in some areas something like an 800 per cent productivity improvement when it put those positions in place&mdash;that it does not know a thing or two about privatisation, the deputy leader should at least have a degree of embarrassment about the way in which he devises his topics. He might have honed it down a little further than the silly grab-all proposition that he put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no easy task to privatise companies that have been in the public sector. Generally, companies that have been in the public sector over the years carry with them a plethora of government decisions on community service obligations that direct their commercial activities in one way or another. This makes it extraordinarily difficult to uncouple when it comes to dealing with privatisation. It is not simply a matter of exchanging ownership of a normally operating private company with a share register already in place, where it is easy to discern the value and where business can be done in relatively short order. Even in those circumstances, there is usually a substantial time lag between taking up a position of ownership and negotiating to reach that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over time, our government business enterprises have served different objectives. It has been a requirement upon us to find ways of uncoupling them in order to get the companies effectively into the private sector. Over the last three years, we have also had the very considerable disadvantage of floating all trade sales in an environment which has been poor economically&mdash;not just in Australia but globally. From time to time it has been necessary to pull back from sales because, even if we were technically prepared to go ahead with the sales, it would have been sheer lunacy and a failure on our part to act in a prudent fashion in the management of the taxpayers' businesses. </PARA>

If it is necessary for that to be organised through the government, then that is the way it should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What any set of managers confront when deciding to operate in the international environment is the most predatory situation anyone could conceive of and which has become even more predatory in the last two years; a situation which means enormous adjustments. ANL has made enormous adjustments over the last few years trying to get its root structure and levels of shipping right and trying to get its industrial relations right through the very successful shipping industry reform process. No matter what it does, if ANL wishes to operate in international trades, it is going to operate against both a massive dumping of capacity on the market&mdash;which has occurred in recent times&mdash;and a couple of shipping companies operating out of China and Russia which have one objective only: the earning of foreign exchange. No matter what cuts are taken in the operational expenses of ANL, they are always going to go under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the situation when dealing with the very small&mdash;in terms of the government's overall ownership operations&mdash;operation of ANL. That is what we are now putting to rest with a process which is very close to the targeted process suggested by those who assisted us in the due diligence process.

On top of that, he gets a third share of the dividends which, I am told, amounted to $2 million the year before last, for heaven's sake. He has had previous appointments, which the shadow treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), has just detailed, such as in the CSIRO and other areas. He has been given $21,075 to sort out ANL&mdash;almost $1,000 a week&mdash;the Remuneration Tribunal base amount. I would have thought that that would have been reasonable, but the government has gone to the Remuneration Tribunal and had that topped up to the tune of $130,000 because Nifty Nev is strapped for cash, making a package of $151,000 for two days work a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Neville Wran is working as many days as he should be in his merchant bank and in the other jobs he has, he should be working a 28-day week, so this work for the ANL should bring him up to a 30-day week.

That is being topped up by $108,000, which brings it to a total of $121,000. If he takes on any further duties, whatever they might be, he will receive up to an extra $30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast that with what the previous board, which was sacked as of yesterday, was getting.

That is the contrast. That is the royal standard, the mates standard that this government is setting down in this country today. This blatant rorting of the public purse is breathtaking in the extreme.

It is very hard to believe the minister when he says that ANL can trade its way out of this given situation.

Presumably, Captain Biggles will get in a plane with a camera, fly over his electorate once a year and take a photograph out the window where his electoral office might be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, although you would not appreciate it from the contributions of those opposite, the topic of today's matter of public importance is: The political and economic implications of the Government's mismanagement of the privatisation of public assets. That raises two aspects: firstly, privatisation policy, and its implementation and economic effect; and, secondly, any adverse political implication that might arise from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start with adverse political implications first. Those opposite certainly have standing to talk about such implications because they are so good at collecting them for themselves. In 1987 you were so good at adverse political implications that half of you thought Joh Bjelke-Petersen would make a good prime minister. In 1990 you were so good at collecting adverse political implications for yourself that you lost the election; you followed an actor who was so bereft of policy that the Australian community would not trust him. After making that mistake, in 1993 you took out the policy machine gun and nailed the Australian community to the wall, and it rejected you again. You certainly have standing to talk about adverse political implications because you are so good at collecting them!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to talk about the government's implementation of policy in this area, I simply refer you to two speeches made by the relevant ministers: firstly, the address given today by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) to the National Press Club; and, secondly, a speech made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to the Committee for Economic Development of Australia in Sydney on 28 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The adverse political implications which you collected as a result of the 1993 election arose out of your policy stance. Just as you have the standing to talk about adverse political implications, you have the nerve to talk about policy in this area. What was your election commitment so far as privatisation was concerned? Your Fightback policy was basically the sledgehammer approach: flog everything off, cut expenditure and impose an unfair tax system. It is a hard right ideological position that the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), is very comfortable with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did you say about that policy after the election? I refer to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 March 1993 by the shadow minister for employment, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coalition's defeat has inevitably led to a spate of attacks on the program from all sides. Whatever else may be said, it is vital to recognise that the program was fundamentally a practical and commonsense program to restore to Australians sound employment prospects, rising living standards, access to high-quality hospital care and education of international standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It stands as the only viable alternative set of policies-</PARA>
<PARA>He further writes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not ideological. There was nothing ideological about the tax reform program.</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely the mantra taken up by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and shadow Treasurer, when they first came to office. They said that they stood for was a practical and commonsense program, nothing ideological. I will come to what they do or do not stand for in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times we have had some commentary from people regarded generally as good analysts of the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is having policy difficulties. Let us look at some of the reasons for this. In an article on 4 June in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Weekly</EMPHASIS>, B.A. Santamaria had this to say about the Liberal Party:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a radical change has recurred in the forces which control it today. It is pre-eminently the party of the new-rich practitioners of the money market, of property developers, of the rapidly growing gambling interests, of alleged `entrepreneurs', and of those who service them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new class does not talk the language of the ordinary people . . . It has no community of interest or even contact with them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what you stand for. The shadow Treasurer would no doubt be pleased to hear that I met the former member Mr Roger Shipton in Parliament House today for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know about opposition members of parliament from Victoria who have lost their seats. On 31 July of this year in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS>, Chris Puplick, one of your former colleagues, said about Fightback and your future policies:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, the Liberals' policies have been regarded as far too narrow and exclusionist.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In totally eschewing Fightback, Downer and Costello risk replacing a strategy of having all policies and no politics with a strategy of all politics and no policies.</PARA>
<PARA>I have detailed how good you are at politics, so you can leave that to one side. Let us now have a look at your no policy zone. This is precisely the point made in response to a question from Laurie Oakes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program by the former leader of the opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), to whom the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition was so loyal. The honourable member for Wentworth said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no doubt at the last election that we stood for certain policy changes, and we had established a dominance in the area of policy debate.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I mean, the reaction straight after the last election, on our side of politics, was almost like headless chooks: everyone was saying: oh, we've been there, we've had policy, we don't want policy any more. Let's just lie doggo and go quiet, look warm and fuzzy and try and get across the line.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have the classic `lie doggo act' from Jeff Kennett's dog opposite us. What have we seen in more recent times? Just today on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the headline is `The day business took Downer aside for a quiet chat'. What does business have to say about the no policy zone surrounding the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer? The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior business leaders have warned the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, that the Coalition must provide detailed policies if it expects to win the support of business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand to spell out policy direction came at a private dinner function on Monday-</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Downer told the group that the Liberals would not be repeating their mistake of releasing detailed policies-</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the policy free zone. The article further reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without details, the Opposition could not expect widespread electoral or business support, Mr Downer was told. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chief executive of a major company said: `We told him to just tell people&mdash;and not just business&mdash;what you believe.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the urging of business: please tell people what you believe. The trouble is that, if they do tell people what they believe, people are not sure whether they can believe them. The main story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Magazine</EMPHASIS> of July 23-24, which details the political credibility of the Leader of the Opposition, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Hewson defeated Howard in the leadership ballot following last year's election, Downer told the Hewson camp that he had voted for the winner, doing his chances of becoming shadow treasurer no harm at all.</PARA>
<PARA>I assume that this practice runs with the coalition shadow treasurers. The story further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That surprised the Howard forces, because Downer told them that he had voted for Howard. When tackled on the issue by one of the Howard supporters, he said that, actually, it had been Howard but he didn't feel he could go and tell Hewson now.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we have the business community urging the opposition to provide some detailed policies and to tell the people what it stands for, and here we have proof that, even if the Leader of the Opposition does tell us what he stands for, we cannot believe him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of policy utterings have we had from the opposition since the honourable member for Mayo took over as Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Higgins took over as Deputy Leader of the Opposition? Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition said, `We are not in favour of foreign investment.' That was turned over a couple days later when he discovered two things: firstly, the opposition had a policy to abolish the Foreign Investment Review Board; and, secondly, a speech he had made a few years ago saying that overseas investment in Australia was intrinsically linked to our international competitors and our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the famous letter to the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) on citizens initiated referendums in which the Leader of the Opposition said, `I support this policy; I am in favour of this policy.' He then changed his mind saying, firstly, `I did not read the letter before I signed it' and then, `If I did read it, I only signed it so as not to cause division.' The Leader of the Opposition is either dishonest, misleading or simply weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had Mabo and the veto of the Northern Territory Aboriginal land rights legislation. Firstly, the Leader of the Opposition said that that would not be disturbed. Then he suddenly discovered that that was wrong so he instituted a review. When asked why he had made such mistakes, he simply said on TV repeatedly, night after night, `I was tired and emotional.' So this is the policy approach that we can expect. The business community urges the opposition to provide it with detail. A strategic decision has been made by the opposition, in policy and political terms, not to provide that detail and when those opposite do give us some detail we simply cannot believe them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before we were interrupted by the proceedings of the House earlier this morning, I was discussing the aspects of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) as they relate particularly to competition policy and focusing on pathology services and the generic drug debate. I think it is important that we have this debate in context. The health system of this country is a very major part of our expenditure as well as our social system. In the 1992-93 financial year it was estimated that Australian expenditure on health and welfare totalled approxi</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>mately $34 billion. In the current financial year the Commonwealth government will expend in excess of $17 billion on health. That puts this in a very substantial context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must pay particular attention to the aspects of competition policy as they relate to the health system because the micro-economic reform of the 1990s, while it will have a significant and dramatic impact on many of our major sectors of the economy&mdash;telecommunications, industry policy and the like&mdash;has not seen substantial debate prior to this. Now that it has commenced we see people, such as the Premier of Victoria, seeking to negate its impact in, for example, the legal profession. I think that is a very retrograde step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, we should focus on the professions and the health industry, in particular. The aspects of competition policy there, because of the sheer size of that sector, are quite substantial, and many of the practices in those professional bodies are rooted in historical concepts which are probably outdated in the context of the economic policy of the 1990s. While I do not seek to impose&mdash;certainly the Hilmer report did not seek to impose&mdash;the full rigours of an open competition policy on the health industry, because quite clearly there are very special aspects to that sector which need to be taken into account, it clearly needs to be reviewed. I am sure that, if the profession can turn its mind to those aspects on a more outward looking basis, the profession can contribute very substantially to its own long-term success, to the economy of Australia and to the welfare of its citizens in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems which we experience in competition policy in relation to this are very much those of the states. It will be a matter for the states to review their position in that regard. As I have said, we have already seen some aspects of that at COAG, and I hope that the states review their policies and ensure that they do work with the Commonwealth and the professions to revise that in the future. One only needs to look at the area of specialists, for example, in the health sector to see how competition policy might well benefit consumers in that regard. Pathology is one very particular example of that. There are estimates that pathology services consume about $700 million a year. I believe that, quite clearly, that contains a very substantial element where competition policy might well benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the process of medical practitioners moving into the pathologist specialty area, one can see that it is very severely restricted. The Royal College of Pathology maintains very substantial barriers to entry to that profession. We must always seek to protect the very high standards of professional care which the profession offers. Indeed, it is quite appropriate to limit entry to specialties where the public must be protected to ensure that the standards are appropriate. But in the case of pathology cases in particular&mdash;and that is one of the main subjects of this bill today&mdash;one must question whether the standards of entry are solely and wholly there to protect the public interest in relation to the standards of health care or whether there is any element of anticompetitive behaviour in the way those entry criteria are regulated. I will leave that debate for another day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain that the profession will adequately maintain the need for those very strict entry criteria but I would say to the profession that if it wants to avoid the possibility of future regulation, if it wants to avoid those kinds of accusations, it is essential that it looks to its own criteria and ensures that they are adequately defensible on public interest criteria and that no element of anti-competitive behaviour is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at pathology, of that $700 million there have been very substantial accusations in the past&mdash;which this bill seeks to address in part&mdash;in relation to the way those services are earned. It has been alleged in previous debates and in the public arena that many of those pathology companies which have become highly mechanised and highly automated, with minimal degrees of professional service content by individual practitioners, and which have been involved in securing access to that very profitable market, have been less than desirable. Some of those sharp practices and some of the illegal practices relate, for example, to the rental of premises in doctors' surgeries where there is no genuine rental at all; it is merely a device for transferring funds to a doctor who participates in the process and constitutes very much a secret commission. That is one example, and only one, of the way pathology companies have possibly sought in the past to improperly secure access to the market and improve their market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to know what percentage of that total throughput in pathology services relates to any overservicing or fraudulent conduct because overservicing is very much in the grey area of fraudulent conduct, but some estimates have put it as high as $100 million of the $700 million. It is impossible to verify those figures, and they have to be taken very much with a grain of salt because the detail is impossible to come by. Overservicing is one of those things that is very hard to establish and prove. The Health Insurance Commission attempts that through detailed statistical analysis of services but in the long run we really do not have an accurate estimate. We can only seek incrementally to address these problems as they arise and hope that the profession will join with us in ensuring that such practices are stamped out vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other aspects of the pathology system which I would like to address today include the level playing field aspect of public versus private pathology services. In my own state of South Australia we have a very effective public service run by the IMVS, the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, which provides substantial amounts of pathology service in the state. It provides a highly specialised and effective service based on the Royal Adelaide Hospital campus, but with outlets in a number of hospitals throughout the country areas of the state as well as the metropolitan area. That broad distribution of services is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As other speakers have alluded to today, the public sector is not entitled to collect the patient initiated collection fee. That puts them at somewhat of a disadvantage. While many of their samples are collected from the Royal Adelaide Hospital and other hospital based services, where collection fees are not particularly relevant, others are in the normal day-to-day general practitioner service. A collection fee would be relevant there and would ensure that the IMVS, along with our public sector pathology agencies, was on a level playing field with its private sector competitors. If there is to be any corporatisation of that service by the state government in South Australia, I would hope that those factors are taken into account. Rather than an outright sale of that group, it is very important that we retain in this highly specialised field, given the substantial amounts of funding which are involved, a significant public presence but on an equal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When looking at the state-wide benefits which the IMVS  provides we should look not only to the fact that it has agencies in a number of regional and country hospitals providing a very valuable service to country people but also to the potential to address some of those difficulties of locational disadvantage through electronic means. Indeed, the broadband services debate which is presently being sponsored by the Minister for Communications (Mr Lee) will provide us with significant new opportunities for extending pathology and other medical services into country areas through the use of very high speed data links between country centres, country hospitals and their city based specialist colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By using some of that new technology we can help to remove the disadvantage which country people experience in this area as well as reducing the costs involved. I would certainly commend that to the government. There are a number of pilot studies under way. Indeed, Whyalla hospital in South Australia is one of those, although not in the pathology area of course. I believe that we could significantly enhance the benefits by examining ways in which those new technologies can be of assistance in the medical field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is just slightly older than I am. It has been around now for some 41, 42 years and has served the public of Australia very well. It started out from humble beginnings. The Chifley government established the process whereby certain lifesaving drugs would be made available to people free of charge. It was continued very much on a bipartisan basis and was further developed in the 1950s by the Menzies government and by other governments since. But the costs of the scheme are rising. We are now talking figures of the order of $2 billion a year. It is quite critical, with growth rates in the last decade averaging some 7.3 per cent per year&mdash;a substantial figure&mdash;that we examine how this service operates and look at ways of increasing its efficiency and reducing the overall cost to the taxpayers of this country without in any way degrading the level of service provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That again brings us to that element of competition policy in the dispensing of generic drugs. It is very important that the medical profession very closely examine its practices in this area. If we look at hospital practice, it has been estimated that in many of the world's major hospitals in Western society some 80 per cent of drugs dispensed in hospital are of a generic basis. In the United Kingdom it is about 50 per cent. In Australia I am sure that the figure is equally as high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people turn to their general practitioner they should expect the same degree of regard for their health and for the cost structures of drug availability. Once a generic drug is available and has been approved by the appropriate authorities as being an equivalent to the drugs which might otherwise be prescribed in the higher price bracket, pharmacies can provide a very effective service to their clients and to Australia as a whole by ensuring the availability of those generic drugs for dispensing and by performing their professional role of advising the public and the patient on what might be prescribed as the alternative, given that the generic drug will have exactly the same beneficial effects as the higher priced alternative which may sometimes be prescribed&mdash;not through any malpractice on the part of the medical profession but simply because in many cases they are very busy people. They are seeing any number of patients. Through habit and past practice it is quite possible to prescribe a particular brand of drug rather than prescribing a generic basis which ensures the lowest cost alternative with the same outcome for the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can avoid some of the problems which have occurred in the past, which the legislation seeks to do by carefully setting out the criteria which are to be involved in this decision, we should ensure a positive outcome. To take a particular example, anti-hypertensives, a couple of those drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits list come to some $100 million a year between them. Just two drugs in one area of use, anti-hypertensives, can impact on the cost to the taxpayer of this kind of prescription. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We not only have to look at the generic drug basis but also have to ensure that the medical profession turns its attention to the dispensing of drugs as a solution, as in the case of hypertension, and the lifestyle factors which bring about hypertension in the first place. We need to ensure that attention is given to those lifestyle factors which would possibly permit treatment of some of these conditions without recourse to such expensive drugs. The more attention we pay to primary health care, the higher the prospects of reducing the $2 billion account for things such as the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the $100 million now spent on anti-hypertensives. Education campaigns targeting both doctors and consumers might have more of an effect than some of the medical care which is now provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government for the legislation. While it is in some ways technical legislation and not particularly policy trend setting legislation, I believe that the impact of some of these small measures will be very substantial and reflect significantly on Australia's health system in areas which are particularly sensitive to the public. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme and pathology services reflect incremental improvements to the major schemes. They are designed in a well crafted way to ensure an improvement to our health system, with an eye on competition policy, which is now very much the centre of debate in this country, while retaining the very high standards of professional care which this country maintains. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this debate to express my concerns about a number of aspects of the pathology segment of the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). I am not suggesting that this aspect of health delivery has not had a fairly knotty history. Advances in medical technology have provided a fertile field for health entrepreneurs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember quite some years ago, when modern pathology began to spread its wings in Brisbane, a number of my friends going to an entrepreneurial pathologist who conducted a vast array of speculative tests at the rebate level. So the patient effectively paid nothing. This then became the basis of a consultation and check-up with the patient's GP. Clearly, very expensive procedures were being used unnecessarily with the flawed assumption that these tests might turn up something. The boot was clearly on the wrong foot and it was a gross waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that we have now moved into more enlightened times and that the cost of health care is of considerable concern to governments, oppositions and the Australian people alike. I appreciate further that the government must put a stop to wasteful and entrepreneurial activities in pathology. However, I feel that, in its zeal to close off these deficient options to a minority group of the profession, the government may have, firstly, placed the responsible majority group of the profession under unnecessary scrutiny; secondly, deprived or limited access to pathology in remote, rural and even some smaller provincial areas; and, thirdly, created a new series of loopholes for the entrepreneurial pathologists to exploit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members are aware, Medicare benefits for pathology are payable only if the service is performed by, or on behalf of, a pathology practitioner. Part II of the legislation requires that pathologists give certain commitments to the minister: personal supervision and an agreement not to provide excessive servicing. The degree of supervision is being laid down in the set of principles to be determined by the minister and will be subject to disallowance by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Association of Pathology Practitioners, which represents 60 per cent of the profession in Australia, is at the coalface of the delivery of private practitioner services. It is in broad agreement with most aspects of the bill. The principles have been sent to the Attorney-General's Department and a draft copy has been sent to the AAPA. However, my sources in the profession have indicated, firstly, that the government appears to be less than enthusiastic about the principles; secondly, that because they run for only 12 months uncertainty is created in the profession; and, thirdly, that the process requires more discussion with the profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991, when the government set about reducing the number of licence collection centres available to pathologists, it did so on the premise that the proliferation of centres was increasing the cost of pathology. It argued that, by limiting the number of outlets, overall practitioner costs would drop, thus lowering the cost of the various services. The scenario went on further to assume that this would lead to lower fees and hence lower rebates. Ultimately, the government assumed a saving of eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy was flawed in a number of aspects, but I would like to deal specifically with the effect on remote, rural and even some small provincial city communities. This policy, in effect, closed many collection centres in these communities. People had to travel hundreds of kilometres for tests. In my electorate people had to travel 50 or 70 kilometres in one direction or another. Naturally, people took risks. They played Russian roulette with their tests or, if you like, with their medical wellbeing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that a lot of savings were made&mdash;but at whose expense? Access is no great problem in capital cities that have public transport systems. The closing of the odd collection centre here or there is not a major concern. But in small communities, especially those where the local hospital cannot effectively conduct the tests, patients have no alternative but to travel to the nearest provincial city. Over a three-year period those collection centres to be axed, euphemistically known as temporary collection centres, were phased out at the rate of one-third per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Brisbane based practice, Doctors Sullivan Nicolaides and Partners, which services my electorate, was forced to close eight centres&mdash;Roma, Warwick, Dalby, Beaudesert, Chinchilla, Childers, Maclean and Bellingen. As part of a lengthy and expensive legal action, it took this case to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and was successful in reversing the decision on only one&mdash;Childers, also in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the proposed closure of Childers, which was 55 kilometres from the nearest pathology laboratory, my predecessor, the then member for Hinkler, merely dismissed the issue by saying that the practice had been given a set quantity of licences and could distribute them as it saw fit. There are 1,140 pathology collection centres and laboratories in Australia and only 17 are in remote areas. This shows the effect of the government's action at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local businessman Bob Kerr, a Childers resident, made the point at the time in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Isis Town and Country </EMPHASIS>newspaper that Medicare would reap the benefit as `a lot of people would not travel when their local pathology centre was closed.' `Besides', he said, `many people require constant monitoring of their condition via blood tests which are taken regularly at the centre.' Quite clearly, these tests could not be taken regularly without considerable travel on the part of the patient because the centre is 55 kilometres away. Subsequently, the local hospital admitted that it could not handle the level of pathology collection. Quite apart from that, the test would probably have been sent to Rockhampton as Bundaberg had only scientists not pathologist public practitioners. Further, local doctors strongly supported the retention of the Childers unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a successful case but it was at an overall cost of $100,000 to the practice which tried to maintain a service there and in the seven other centres that I have mentioned. To its credit, Sullivan Nicolaides, at the sacrifice of two other centres, has returned to Warwick and Roma. As I pointed out before, of the 1,140 licensed centres in Australia only 17 are in remote areas and four are operated by the firm Sullivan Nicolaides. That is not a good advertisement for the government's stated ambition in this bill of delivering better services to remote and rural areas. Some 17 in over 1,000 is not a very good record and it would need to be improved under the new guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If the government cuts back on local collection centres, as it has being saying in negotiations with the profession, then the bill before us today will become a farce in 12 months time. Under the new determination, practices will be able to trade-off one collection centre entitlement for three remote area collection centres. To the government's credit, at least this is a step in the right direction and does, to some extent, recognise country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take issue with the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) who spoke earlier in the day about the socioeconomic aspects of pathology delivery, as he called it. He talked about the concept of managed competition. That might be well and good in the context of closely settled suburbs with well-defined public transport systems providing access to large, well-equipped hospitals with a proliferation of well-developed services and facilities, but I am talking about the most basic of collection services in towns that, in many instances, have now been gutted by this ALP government. That is a country mile away from two or more competitive services. Let us just have one service in these country centres to begin with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme could not possibly have universal application without a further massive injection of state and/or federal funding to provide pathologist practitioners in large or medium sized hospitals. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) may not be aware that, apart from the largest provincial centres, such as Toowoomba, Rockhampton and Townsville in Queensland, the pathology services conducted in those hospitals are not conducted by licensed medical practitioners; they are conducted by scientist pathologists. Under the government's own guidelines, there have to be medical practitioner pathologists in personal supervision. The suggestion from the honourable member for Werriwa is flawed in its primary premise. If the government wanted to achieve what he proposed today, there would have to be a massive injection of funding to provide medical practitioner pathologists to a vast range of hospitals right across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Finally, even if we could achieve what the honourable member for Werriwa suggested, what would happen when the going gets tough, as happened with the pharmacy regime? Would we see the hospital pharmacies force public patients out into the private system? We would see, as occurs with pathology at present, patients being carefully questioned as to whether or not they have private health status. That even applies to patients who come into the hospital as public patients. If they admit to being privately insured, even as public patients, their tests are taken to the private sector in order to take pressure off the Commonwealth-state aspect of the funding of those hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a very good foundation on which to build a quasi, Hilmer-like, semi-competitive system. If the government is going to proceed with something along these lines, it needs to think it through carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation, which was effective from 31 July this year, gives the Health Insurance Commission quite extraordinary powers. It follows that it should exercise this authority with a great deal of good sense and equanimity&mdash;not with heavy-handedness. A blow-out of $70 million in costs in the last 12 months cannot be ignored, but the focus needs to be on those who abuse and manipulate the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a view at the responsible end of the profession that the Health Insurance Commission is less than diligent in closing down unlicensed centres. There is also a view that continuing schemes are already in place to circumvent the minister's new determinations and principles. I am advised that the Australian Metropolitan Medical Services Proprietary Limited of Fitzroy in Melbourne has been set up specifically to avoid the new legislation. Its modus operandi involves this firm hiring space in or near a group of doctors. It then employs pathology specimen collectors, who are not necessarily doctors or trained nurses. It then directs them to a licensed APA pathology practice. No explanation is made as to how payment is made to the AMMS. The effect is to have an unlicensed collection centre at arms length from effective scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that the government investigates such practices to determine whether they circumvent the spirit of the new arrangements, how the various parties are paid, and whether AMMS and similar bodies employ qualified pathologists. If it is not in conformity with the minister's draft principles as they now stand&mdash;and I understand that these have been to the Attorney-General's Department for scrutiny&mdash;then such practices should be brought into line. </PARA>

There is a recognition on both sides of the House that it needs to be tightened up. In the spirit of bipartisanship, I suggest to the government that a great deal of follow-up work needs to be done, especially in regard to the determination of these principles. It should instruct the Health Insurance Commission to direct a great deal more of its energy to the irresponsible end of the pathology profession and not to the vast majority of those who are providing a valuable service across this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure speaking in this debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation  Amendment Bill (No. 2). As was indicated in earlier debate, this is an omnibus bill which deals with several minor amendments to a number of pieces of primary legislation. I do not intend to refer to those amendments relating to the services schedule or the pathology schedule that deal with the Health Insurance Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that a housekeeping type of arrangement will remove some of the anomalies in the legislation. The amendments contained in this legislation will substitute the reference to the pensioner health benefits card with the pensioner concession card in line with changes that have been made to the nomenclature by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address my remarks to those changes that have been made in the area of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The first change restricts the issue of safety net concession cards to Australian residents only. It is generally accepted that the purpose of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is to provide those drugs listed on the schedules to Australian residents. Therefore, what we see is, in part, an attempt to achieve this by restricting the issue of safety net concession cards to those who hold a Medicare card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not prevent non-Medicare card holders from being beneficiaries of the subsidised drugs under the schedule. It means that, when they reach the safety net level, they will be unable to get the further subsidies that are available. This measure has the cooperation of those pharmacists who will be asked to do some of the gathering of information. I think that is important. Anybody who has observed the tension&mdash;and perhaps that is an understatement&mdash;due to the way the pharmaceutical benefits scheme operates between those who are required to cooperate would understand that there is a need to ensure that pharmacists, through the Pharmacy Guild and other organisations that speak on behalf of pharmacy profession, agree with the measures that are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the potential savings estimated by the government, we see that this is not an inconsiderable measure. It is estimated that the savings for the rest of this financial year will be about $400,000. There is an estimated saving for a full financial year in subsequent years of $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there has been discussion about its implementation. At the time of the issue of a safety net concession card at a pharmacy, there is a requirement to gather information. It is not too great an imposition to include the Medicare number details at that time. I am sure that the government, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) and the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) are aware of the necessity to look into the privacy considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure contained in this omnibus bill will allow for brand substitution under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by an approved pharmacist where acceptable under the relevant state and territory law. This arises out of an agreement that was achieved at the Australian Health Ministers Conference in March this year. It was confirmed in this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme requires the cooperation of a number of people. The overall scheme starts at pharmaceutical companies, the drug providers, and requires the cooperation of medical practitioners as the prescribers, pharmacists as the dispensers, and the consumers, the people in need of medicines and drugs, who play an important role by having an understanding of the proper use of drugs for the treatment or prevention of illness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time, of course, generic drugs have been available. Put simply, generic drugs are drugs that have come out of their patent period and which a pharmaceutical company has decided to pick up and manufacture. After the government procedures have been followed for the proper technical consideration of these generic drugs, these drugs can be listed under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme with a different brand name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent times we have put in place a minimum pricing arrangement that requires generic drugs, if they are considered to be bioequivalent, to be listed on the pharmaceutical benefits list at the cheapest price available. If people choose to use the drug that is at a higher price, the difference between the price agreed on by the government and the manufacturer is passed on to the consumer, the person requiring the drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has caused some problems. I guess a number of members in this place have received complaints from pensioners wanting to know why there is an additional cost over and above the pensioner benefit scale. Because of a lack of understanding of the system people want to know why there are differences in the drugs. There has been some concern about whether the little blue round pill is the same as the oblong yellow pill. I understand that consumers confronting those sorts of considerations can be a bit bemused by what is actually going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the stringent testing of these drugs the types of considerations that are important&mdash;including the bioequivalence of the drugs&mdash;have to be looked into. Therefore the listing on the schedule should mean that the consumer need not have any fear. At the moment if a consumer after having a drug prescribed by a medical practitioner gets into a discussion with the local pharmacist about a higher priced drug, it is very difficult for that person to get the lesser price brand name drug dispensed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will allow, after discussion with the pharmacist&mdash;who we must remember is a properly trained, qualified professional with an understanding of the matters that arise out of the use of generic drugs and bioequivalence problems&mdash;for that drug to be substituted at that time. At the moment there is a provision, which might be described as being rather clumsy, whereby the pharmacist, the dispenser of the drug, can contact the prescriber to try to change the brand prescribed. Often this can be of advantage if the pharmacist does not have the drug on his or her shelves at that time, because it means the consumer is not inconvenienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under the agreement by the health ministers, and where necessary as a result of changes to relevant state and territory legislation, it will be possible for a pharmacist to dispense the other brand name of the drug after coming to an agreement with the consumer. It is important that we recognise that there are several safeguards in the legislation&mdash;including proposed section 103 subsection 2A, which sets out the conditions that must be met. The conditions are, first, that a prescriber has not indicated on the prescription that the brand substitution is not to occur. That is, if the medical practitioner, the person who is prescribing the drug, knows of any reason&mdash;maybe a history where the particular brand name has not been suitable to the consumer&mdash;it can be put on the script that this particular brand is the only brand that the practitioner wishes to be dispensed to this patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second provision is that the prescribed brand and the substitute brand must be listed on the schedule of pharmaceutical benefits as being bioequivalent. The third condition is that the prescribed brand and the substituted brand are determined under the act to be allowable brands for pharmaceutical benefits, again after the relevant testing of each of the different brands. The fourth condition is that the supply of the substituted brand does not contravene the law of the relevant state or territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a degree of professional jealousy&mdash;`jealousy' may be too strong a word&mdash;between pharmacists and the medical profession. I think that the pharmacists, if they had their wont, would say that it is sufficient for the generic name of the drug&mdash;that is, the compound name of the drug&mdash;to be the name that is on the script. It is now general practice to prescribe mainly by brand name, whereas in hospitals the chemical compound name tends to be used in dispensing. Pharmacists say it would be better if the decision about the brand of the drug could be left up to them; as long as the drug name is identified on the script they can make the professional judgment about which brand should be issued. As I said, perhaps we are not all that close to that being achieved, but it is a consideration. Pharmacists would say that due to their training that would be sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the legislation goes to the way in which these drugs will be indicated in the schedule of drugs. I just wish to refer to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prescribed health</EMPHASIS>, which was issued in three parts. That committee was chaired by me, so that is why I want to get this free kick in about the worth and value of it. In re-reading this report I have to admit that we overlooked making any determination or recommendation about substitute dispensing. I do not quite understand how in the end of our inquiry we did that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there is no need for any inquiry. The other matters that we went to were definitive enough. I did make some comments about the consumer having some concern about the change in the brand name of the drugs. I was promoting the view that in the main they should not have that concern because the testing and the proper listing should be sufficient assurance for them that the drug has bioequivalence and that there should not be any problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence that the committee received during the last parliament it was indicated to us that there were problems with a small number of drugs. Here we get into technical terms such as bioequivalence and bioavailability. Perhaps a science graduate in zoology should not attempt to go further to explain the differences between bioavailability and bioequivalence today. Suffice it to say that, whether it be bioequivalence or bioavailability, on some occasions there is the potential for there to be a different pharmacological reaction or therapeutic reaction when the consumer uses those drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee suggested that those sorts of matters be listed in the schedule. Where it is known that there are elements that cause these slight differences, whether it be the coloured dyes used for the capsules or other filler material used in the formulation of tablets and capsules, it should be identified and there should be cautionary notes to ensure that those who are professionally trained can understand that those precautions should be taken. I am pleased that, in a sense, there has been some form of achievement earlier this year in a form of cooperative federalism. It might be only a minor matter, but perhaps in the larger scheme of things we will also be able to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the changes relating to substitute dispensing that are being made in this legislation are very important. Hopefully they will break down the barriers and misconceptions that abound about the use of generic drugs. I am sure they will go a long way toward it. It is one of those exercises where the proof is probably in the eating of the pudding. Perhaps it should not be dispensed with in such simple terms, but I am sure that the proof of the value of the system and of the use of generic drugs will be further achieved by this measure. There is no actual saving to government, because the saving goes directly to consumers by giving them easier access to the minimum priced drugs. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 because I am particularly concerned about one area that is involved in the bill, and that is the area of pathology collection centres. `P' may stand for pathology; however, the `p' in politics stands for people. I think that, while it is obvious that not only the changes that are forecast but also the changes that have been made already are dollar driven, we should never forget the position of the people that we are all here to represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am afraid that in what has happened, not only in this legislation but also earlier this year, the people have been ignored, particularly in remote areas. There is a certain sense of deja vu about this; it is the skin cancer situation revisited. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) will recall that last October the then Minister for Health, former Senator Richardson, announced new guidelines for the treatment of skin cancer. This is very relevant to what we are talking about today. Access to skin cancer treatment in rural, regional and remote areas was decimated as a result of a reaction of the HIC to overservicing in the cities, which had a totally adverse effect on people in country Australia. The parliamentary secretary will recall that, under those new guidelines, GPs, no matter how experienced or expert they are in the treatment of skin cancer with liquid nitrogen, are no longer allowed to provide such treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On several occasions I have been to an excellent doctor in Coffs Harbour to have a number of things burnt off, as most of us do from time to time. I will not embarrass him by naming him. He is a GP who is widely respected and acknowledged as being expert in terms of skin cancer. After the new guidelines were announced, no longer could I go to this particular doctor and get that treatment immediately. He would have to take a pathology specimen and send it off to a pathology lab to be examined and then sent back. Then I would have to go back to him or he would have to refer me to a skin specialist. If we are concerned about overservicing and the blow-out of the health dollar, I cannot see the sense in that circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from that, the impact of this new system on people in rural areas caused a great deal of disadvantage, particularly for those in areas of remoteness&mdash;not like in my area, which is fairly close knit. If you are a farmer or grazier living somewhere out of Walgett and you have to travel an hour or more&mdash;maybe two or three hours&mdash;to get to a doctor, these new guidelines make things very difficult. Instead of these people going once to their GP, who was good at this&mdash;and I am not saying that all GPs would be; there are different levels of experience, but I think that by and large most country GPs know their limitations&mdash;they would have to go back again. I know that, if a patient went to see my GP in Coffs Harbour about something that was beyond him, very often he would send the patient on to a specialist. That is right and proper; it is as it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side to the matter is that at that time the government was withdrawing licences for pathology services in many country towns. Of course, as a result, specimens had to be sent very much further afield, resulting in long and unnecessary waits for treatment. The point that I believe forms the basis of this current situation is the knee-jerk reaction to the classic example of the glass castles. The glass castles are medical centres in the capital cities. We have all heard many anecdotal stories about overservicing through the glass castles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was on the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts in the mid-1980s there was a very famous case about overservicing of pathology involving a certain doctor which highlighted one of the problems. We are not going to solve the problem for the people&mdash;the `P' in politics&mdash;just by overreacting in this knee-jerk way and not attacking the real problem. If the real problem is overservicing, for the life of me I cannot see any sense in cutting back on the servicing of people in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), has been working very hard on this. I am totally convinced that, contrary to some unkind comments, she knows exactly what she is doing in this area. I reject and refute the various comments that have been floating around. I know from speaking with her personally about this that she does know what she is doing with it. I thank her for pursuing the undertaking from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) to do all that can be done to protect the people that we are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to this bill, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) made reference to a number of areas where pathology collection centres had been cancelled. Among the ones he mentioned&mdash;I think almost 75 per cent of them are in Queensland&mdash;he happened to include Bellingen, which is in my electorate. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will know that Bellingen is an absolutely beautiful town situated in a lovely valley on the Bellinger River. I have not had the pleasure of taking the parliamentary secretary to Bellingen with his cheque for $2 million or $3 million for an aged care facility, but I look forward to doing that at some time in the future. He is always welcome. Former Senator Kerry Sibraa was the last person to bring a cheque to Bellingen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bellingen and Urunga are two areas where the pathology collection centres were withdrawn. One might well say, `That is not a terrible inconvenience. Coffs Harbour is only half an hour's drive away. If somebody needs that sort of pathology testing, they could just hop in their car and toddle off to Coffs Harbour.' It is not as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area&mdash;indeed, up and down the whole north coast of New South Wales&mdash;there is an extremely high number of elderly Australians. The last time I looked, the number of people aged 65 or more was at least 50 per cent higher than the Australian average. Very often, these people do not have cars and they are in straitened circumstances. There is no public transport. As well as that, we have an enormously high unemployment level. People who are dependent on unemployment benefits are not flush with money and cannot just get in the car and go to Coffs Harbour all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Even though Bellingen is a beaut community of about 3,000 people and is a highly desirable place to live, the reality is that there is no public transport there. To that extent, it enjoys a degree of isolation that one would not normally ascribe to a town in that area. But the elderly who have no transport are isolated. Those of any age who are unemployed with no vehicle and very little money are also isolated. One does not have to be out the back of Bourke to be remote from medical services. That is why I feel so strongly about this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) mentioned one of the two major companies servicing our area, which are Sullivan Nicolaides and Hampson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had much support from the whole Bellingen valley in opposing the closure of these collection centres. If somebody has to have a sample collected for pathology, what does it matter if it happens there? It will not cost the government any more if it is collected in Bellingen as opposed to Coffs Harbour. If there is overservicing, that is a different matter. If there is overservicing, we should be attacking that, but not by taking away a medical service from ordinary Australians who desperately need it. </PARA>

The Aka Bella Choir has a marvellous repertoire of four-part harmonies. They say that many of their songs represent the struggle for freedom and equality for which others have fought.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are towns and communities around Australia where ordinary Australians are being disadvantaged and being treated with injustice and inequity because of the dollar drive of the HIC. We have to cut overexpenditure. I know that and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know that. Nobody would debate that there has to be an attack on overservicing. But my point is that we will not cure the disease by killing the patient. If overservicing is the problem, let us deal with that. Let us attack those money mad mates in the glass castles; let us not attack the pensioners and the unemployed in small communities around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> My final comment is that we in the coalition on this side of the House are totally opposed to retrospectivity when it comes to attacking the taxpayer&mdash;the citizen or ordinary Australian. We do not believe that legislation should be retrospective in harming or taking away things from the people of Australia. Personally, I have no objection to retrospectivity which rights a wrong or redresses an injustice. Therefore, the parliamentary secretary might convey to the minister the thought that, once the government has solved the real problem and can then address a retrospective creation of justice, we might be able to get to the point where these pathology collection centres could be reinstated to serve and properly look after the disadvantaged people of Australia. </PARA>

It is good that in this House we have constructive debates of the kind that we have seen here today. It is a pity that sometimes these sorts of debates are not televised so that the people can get a different idea about the hard work that goes into legislation. It would be preferable to the televising of question time, when there is far too much activity that could be performed by members of Actors Equity. I thank all members for their contributions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to refer to some of the issues raised. Firstly, a number of opposition members raised the issue of the rural and remote pathology services. I note that the honourable member for Cowper is present. He is always pretty active in trying to ensure that the government meets its targets in relation to rural and remote services. The honourable member does not have much to complain about. I remember opening at least four major centres in his electorate in the last 12 months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I think he is mistaken. I do not think we can complain too much about the general social justice policies of the government. But there is clearly an issue here in terms of pathology centres. Again, when legitimate problems of this kind are raised by the opposition and others, we need to respond. It is my intention to announce that some action will be taken in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural and remote licence collection centre provisions of the Health Insurance Act were reviewed in consultation with peak professional bodies. These consultations have resulted in the government proposing, as part of the minister's determination of the rural and remote provisions, to allow one licence to cover three centres in specified rural and remote areas. So we are putting in a kind of one for three rule, which is quite an important rule. These areas are identified by the Department of Human Services and Health as `rural other' or `remote other' in its January 1994 publication of rural and remote areas classifications, which has been based on the Australian Bureau of Statistics definition of statistical local areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the determination of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is a disallowable instrument and that parliament will have the opportunity to examine the matter in detail. However, I can assure honourable members that the government will develop this determination in consultation with those in the profession and the professional bodies. We are moving ahead with this legislation and I hope that it will result in concrete results which will satisfy honourable members, especially the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). I had the pleasure of recently meeting with the honourable member for Hinkler when I opened an Australian Hearing Services laboratory in Bundaberg. So I do not think they can complain too much about remote and rural areas. The government really has that going and we are intending to ensure that services are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition have made an important point that has concerned the government about the provision of health services in rural areas. We still have the problem of the refusal or the reluctance of medical practitioners, especially specialists, to live in rural areas. For some extraordinary reason, amongst all the groups of professionals, doctors are the ones who do not like living in rural areas. We have tried to encourage them to live there. The government welcomes ideas as to how we can solve the problem, which is a problem for us as a nation, of the provision of medical services. I know I can speak on behalf of the minister in saying that we welcome ideas from both sides of the House as to how this problem may be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point raised by the shadow minister about pharmacists taking on extra work as a result of this new measure is, given the balance of priorities, with respect to the honourable member for Mackellar, not really an issue. It is not up to the pharmacist to police Medicare details. When patients go to have a prescription filled out, it is their duty to declare whether they have validity under the Medicare arrangements, as they do now when applying for a safety net card. I do not think it is going to lead to a significant increase in the work done by pharmacists, but it will lead to a significant increase in the power of pharmacists in the exercise of their professional expertise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now saying, as some honourable members have mentioned, that if a person gets a prescription from a doctor and goes to a pharmacist and the pharmacist says, `Even though this is a PBS drug, it is going to cost you the $28,' and then the pharmacist says, `I'm a bit puzzled as to why the doctor, knowing that there is an equivalent drug didn't give you that one, which is would cost you $5 or $10 instead of $28,' and the person says, `That is extraordinary; what can we do about that?' the pharmacist, if he or she is really cooperative and interested in going to the trouble, can then ring the doctor and get the doctor's approval to dispense the cheaper drug. But the pharmacist has to get the doctor at that moment and the doctor might say, `No, I'm not interested in talking to the pharmacist.' Unless we have a really cooperative system, we will have a system that does not work very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now saying that there will be a principle of equivalence. That means that the pharmacist can say, `Here is an equivalent drug that is cheaper. We can give you that instead of the one prescribed by the doctor.' But there will be exceptions and rules governing that. If, for example, a doctor has insisted, for medical reasons, on only that particular brand being prescribed, that is a different point. There are also a couple of other criteria. In general, it is true to say that we have a system here that is going to mean fairer and, in many cases, cheaper medicines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also going to give us an additional power. Some pharmaceutical companies have been outrageous in refusing to reach a reasonable price with the PBS on some of the medicines. The minister and I, as parliamentary secretary, get letters from constituents all the time telling us that they have gone to the doctor, were given this prescription and it has cost so much. We always urge companies, and the PBS system urges companies, to give a fair price. But we will not pay exorbitant prices. We have to keep an eye out for the fact that we have to be responsible in relation to the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these companies ought to recognise that there are equivalent drugs. They ought to have similar prices rather than think that they can get some doctors to prescribe a highly exorbitant drug and persuade the patient that that is the only drug available. Therefore, this change is going to benefit a lot of people who have struggled in certain circumstances to get a prescription which will be adequate for the purposes. Although this change seems minor, let us hope that there is a significant change in practice. I also hope it is a change which will lead to more responsible behaviour on the part of doctors, pharmacists and the companies supplying the pharmaceuticals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The shadow minister raised a concern about the definition by the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of `equivalence', which has a broader meaning than `bioequivalence'. She argued that the latter should be used. The amendment needs to be read in its entirety. This legislation requires that brands which are to be substituted have to be equivalent and must be identified in the pharmaceutical benefits schedule. Bioequivalence is a specific term relating to biological testing. Some brands can be accepted as equivalent without undergoing bioequivalence testing where the Therapeutic Goods Administration accepts that the testing is not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not trying to open it up to some very general, vague notion of equivalence. We are saying that we do not have to have specific bioequivalence. Where it is required we will have it, but where the Therapeutic Goods Administration, in its judgment, has decided that it is not required it will not be necessary to do that. There is no difference between what the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association is suggesting and what is in the legislation. So the suggested change of wording is really not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister also raised a concern about brand substitution and its impact on co-marketing arrangements, such as those between Amrad and Merck, Sharp and Dohme. We are aware of these concerns and the Minister for Human Services and Health has noted these concerns about the supply of drugs marketed under this arrangement. The minister has instructed the Department of Human Services and Health that where both companies agree such products should not be flagged as interchangeable. In relation to that, a letter was dispatched today from the Minister for Human Services and Health to the managing director of Amrad notifying him of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to those matters, I think we can say that we have tried to meet the concerns raised by the shadow minister. In overall terms, we can say that in these areas we are trying to resolve issues which have a certain technical complexity but which nevertheless in their outcomes can have a big impact on people's ability and the nation's ability to pay for medical services. In that regard, therefore, I think the legislation is worthy of support and I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>One of the major commitments in Working Nation is to ensure that the long-term unemployed get extra assistance to enable them to participate better in the jobs growth. The success of Jobstart in targeting long-term unemployed assistance is reflected in the drop in the number of long-term unemployed. As I brought to the attention of the House yesterday, the number of long-term unemployed has fallen by 41,000 over the last year and by 76,000 since the last election, that is, out of a total job growth in that time of 376,000 people. This is against a backdrop where, during the 1980s, it took seven years and 1.6 million jobs to cut long-term unemployed by 109,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation takes the targeting measures one important step further; it significantly extends case management services and opens those services and their provision up to competition. Experience is that this targeting of intensive one-to-one servicing is very successful in improving the opportunities for long-term unemployed people to obtain jobs. Case management will provide a continuing relationship between a job seeker and a case manager. Together they will develop a personalised package of assistance that will focus on effective job searching and matching to identify job opportunities. Where job search activity fails to result in employment, labour market program assistance will be provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this legislation is to promote full employment by providing a free public employment service and to draw on a diversity of public sector, community and private sector resources to achieve this goal as cost effectively as possible. This legislation will improve the quality and effectiveness of employment services through enhanced case management services for the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides the framework for development over time of an open competitive environment for the supply of case management services. A new regulatory body, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority&mdash;ESRA&mdash;will be established independently of the Department of Employment, Education and Training. One of its central responsibilities will be to encourage and facilitate contracted case managers to provide case management services in competition with Employment Assistance Australia, which will be DEET's case management organisation, formed from part of the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ESRA will promote competition and fair and efficient market conduct. These arrangements are intended to meet the needs of job seekers, employers and the local community while maintaining high standards of accountability and probity in the use of the public resources provided. The longer term aim of the legislation is for job seekers to have a choice of case manager. The legislation also ensures that there are reciprocal obligations on job seekers through case management activity agreements which will outline an agreed course of action for case manager and job seeker. Agreements will focus the efforts of case managers and job seekers firmly on attaining employment for job seekers. </PARA>

This will be supported by access to programs, vocational training, relevant remedial courses in literacy, numeracy or English language skills and community-based work experience or subsidised employment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of delivering case management services, a case management activity agreement will be developed and agreed by the case manager and the job seeker. The requirements of the case management activity agreement will give force to the Working Nation emphasis on the reciprocal obligations of job seekers, especially those who have become eligible for the job compact. For example, the case management activity agreement will require a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme and case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her agreement and provide relevant information to the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will also require that the job seeker's compliance with the case management activity agreement occurs. The legislation provides that a case management activity agreement will take the place of a Newstart activity agreement or a job search activity agreement for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1991. Failure to enter into a case management activity agreement or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreement will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a Newstart activity agreement or a job search agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation reflects a bold and imaginative venture by the federal government. Together with the job compact and new incentives to employers through the training wage and subsidies, it will better equip us to tackle unemployment and, in particular, long-term employment. It will encourage into this field many community and business organisations which will bring with them special expertise, local knowledge and links with employers. In doing so they will provide a much wider range of choice of service for job seekers and improve job seekers' chances of returning to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a radically new approach. There is currently no well developed non-government case management market, and many providers will be learning as they go. Equally for the government and for ESRA it will be very much a matter of learning by doing. While the legislation seeks to be as specific as possible, it also reflects the certainty that many new problems will emerge over time and there will be a need to set down detailed aspects of the new arrangements quickly to address unanticipated needs and problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to speak to the Employment Services Bill 1994 and the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994, both of which raise issues of considerable significance in the overall debate on what can be done to solve unemployment in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill 1994, the principal of these two bills, has two main purposes. Firstly, it establishes an entity to be known as Employment Assistance Australia within the Department of Employment, Education and Training, giving effect to the case management system announced in Working Nation&mdash;the government's white paper on employment and growth&mdash;principally for long-term unemployed people and certain other unemployed people considered to be at risk. Secondly, the bill establishes a new regulatory authority, the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, as an independent statutory authority within the employment, education and training portfolio. ESRA will be responsible for regulating the case management system within both the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 makes consequential amendments to five separate acts arising from the proposed Employment Services Act 1994. These five acts are: the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Ombudsman Act 1976, the Privacy Act 1988 and the Social Security Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset let me make it quite clear that, contrary to what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) may have us believe, the bills currently before the House are not in any way about creating sustainable jobs. As an integral part of the white paper, these bills are about political survival&mdash;the government's survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper itself, out of which these bills arise and whose proposals they seek to implement, is not fundamentally about solving unemployment; it is, as Professor Helen Hughes of the full employment project has said, about making unemployment palatable to the community, about making it appear as though action is being taken. The white paper is all about training and short-term subsidised schemes designed to reduce the statistical levels of unemployment with both eyes fixed firmly on the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about concealing unemployment. The training and other schemes within the white paper have the potential to hide over 200,000 unemployed people from the unemployment figures. On a conservative estimate, when fully operational, the job compact within the white paper could hide some 120,000 unemployed people, the parenting allowance could hide some 59,000 and the mature age allowance could hide some 30,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims in the explanatory memorandum that the aim of the Employment Services Bill 1994&mdash;the bill that I will focus on for most of my remarks in the course of this debate&mdash;is to promote full employment, a goal which the coalition obviously supports. There is no doubt that securing employment for all those who want to work and cannot find it, or who want more work than they are currently able to find, is the pre-eminent task facing Australia today. It is not too much to say that the future of our society is directly tied up with the ability of our country to provide people with work and with satisfying work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, given the current policy mix, there is no possibility that this goal will be achieved by this government or that it will be achieved by the year 2000. Growth projections in the 1994-95 budget of 4 1/2 per cent per annum through to the end of the decade make it apparent that unemployment at the end of this time will not be five per cent; it will be closer to seven per cent, and that is on the optimistic assumption that there will be no further downturn in the business cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does this equate to abandonment of the notion of full employment, but Professor Hughes has expressed the view that during the next business downturn unemployment could reach as high as 15 per cent. In other words, the unemployment ratchet whereby each downturn in the last two decades has begun with unemployment at a higher rate than at the start of the previous downturn and whereby unemployment has reached a higher peak in each succeeding recession is still in place. The unemployment ratchet is still operating in this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That, as the honourable member for Ballarat has quite correctly said, is the frightening aspect of the current situation that Australia faces. It is in this context that we have to attempt to assess the implications of the government's white paper and, in particular, the schemes to address the problem of long-term unemployment which are before us in the present legislation. The fact that the unemployment ratchet is still in place means, I believe&mdash;and I regret to say this&mdash;the certain failure of the white paper, because without the full-time jobs coming through as a result of economic growth in sufficient numbers the subsidised jobs under the white paper will not translate into a sustainable transition of long-term unemployed people back into the work force. It is because of this that I propose to move an amendment to the bill, which I will read for the benefit of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, this House deplores the Government's failure to provide real sustainable job opportunities".</PARA>
<PARA>During the past seven weeks I have travelled throughout Australia visiting every state, including major regional centres, and have undertaken an extensive consultative process to gain a first-hand impression of the extent of the unemployment problem in Australia and reactions to the government's white paper. I have held discussions with a range of voluntary agencies such as the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, Wesley Mission and Lifeline&mdash;some of the agencies which are very likely to become case managers under the scheme outlined in the legislation. I visited a number of training organisations endeavouring to provide young people with the skills they need to attempt to obtain jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked with young and long-term unemployed people, homeless people and those seeking to provide these people with assistance back into the work force. I have talked with many small business people about the reasons why they are hesitating to take on unemployed people and what their attitude is likely to be to the training schemes and subsidised employment proposals of the white paper, the job compact and the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that I have heard during these discussions is remarkably consistent. The fact is that at the moment people do not believe the white paper. They are fearful that in many cases its measures to help the long-term unemployed will actually be counterproductive. The vast majority of unemployed people still feel very strongly that the recovery is passing them by. They approach the white paper's promise of further training and subsidised employment with great scepticism and wariness because they feel that they have heard it all before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business, which in the end is going to have to create the long-term sustainable jobs, is exceedingly sceptical of the white paper. The task of the government is to create the environment within which confidence in the future can be restored and in which the door to opportunities can be opened. Small business, however, will only create those jobs when it is confident that interest rates are not going to once again become a trap, as they did in the late 1980s, when they do not have to cut their way through a jungle of red tape and bureaucracy whenever they want to innovate or employ someone, when the tax burden is eased and the system is less complex and costly to comply with and when every effort to establish an enterprise agreement does not expose them to outside interference by union or tribunal or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge deficit spending which the federal government has indulged in in recent years and, indeed, since the 1992 One Nation statement has vastly expanded is one of the significant elements in holding back a significant revival of business confidence. It is an almost universal view that I have found amongst small businesses that they will be exceedingly reluctant to take on new employees under subsidised employment programs because they are concerned that they are already fully occupied in coping with the amount of demand on them by the government. They want to be able to take on people who can make an immediate contribution to the productivity of their enterprise. They would much prefer to take on, where they have the demand and the capacity to encourage them to do so, someone who can immediately come into a full-time, unsubsidised position. So it remains to be seen how many new employees in subsidised positions the small business sector will be prepared to take on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally as important, as the Salvation Army and others have pointed out to me on a number of occasions during my meetings with them, the social impact of the worst recession  for 60 years has yet to peak. Family breakdown measured by divorce rates has just reached a 10-year high. Appallingly, the number of suicides among young people has been climbing. The demand on the services of voluntary organisations such as the Salvation Army has yet to show any signs of easing in most parts of Australia. In other words, for the almost 900,000 unemployed Australians and their families and the over 300,000&mdash;I notice that the minister in his second reading speech used the figure of 500,000&mdash;long-term unemployed the recession we had to have is still a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say right at the outset that the concept of helping the long-term unemployed back into the work force is a good one and an appropriate one. It is one that we advocated very strongly in our programs in the last election campaign and put forward a number of very constructive measures to address through the Austrain scheme and through the local community employment boards. In the present circumstances it is absolutely essential that the dire circumstances of the long-term unemployed be addressed. There is no doubt whatever that the problem is major. It is getting worse for those who are long-term unemployed. The social distress, the individual distress, that the long-term unemployed are suffering is growing at present without any sign in their eyes of short-term relief. There is, I believe, a universal recognition in this country that the mismanagement of Australia's financial and economic affairs over the last decade has led to the development of a new underclass in this country, and that this underclass is becoming increasingly  entrenched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is the case that the white paper reveals that the government has at long last, after many years, become aware that this problem will not go away and that it must be addressed. The issue is whether the white paper and the measures in the legislation we are considering this evening have identified and will implement the solution. In our view, while there are good features to aspects of the proposals which the government has put forward, it has not provided the solution to the problem. Partly that is because it has not put in place the essential prerequisite for the success of any intensive and sustained attempt to help the long-term unemployed, which is sustainable growth in long-term employment at a rate sufficient to increase the demand for long-term unemployed people in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect is that the measures which are implemented through this legislation are unlikely to be successful. The core of the government's proposal is the jobs compact. The key element of the jobs compact is the offer of a job to people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more. These people are to be offered case management, assessment of the employment barriers they face and additional training where required to help them become job ready. In return, there is imposed on them a reciprocal obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is quite appropriate. The government has done the right thing in making it clear that this is a part of its arrangements. However, most long-term unemployed people are going to have to wait a very long time to get assistance under the job compact. The job compact is to be phased in over four years. It offers no immediate hope in the near future for most of the long-term unemployed. It will be literally years before some people who are presently long-term unemployed will be offered jobs under the job compact. Indeed, the white paper spells out clearly that people who have been receiving benefits for over 18 months will have received a job compact offer by the end of 1997-98. I do not think that is going to be of great comfort to a great many long-term unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to case management, many of the organisations that I have met with are simply adopting a wait and see attitude and believe that case managers operating under the new system will simply not have the time or the resources to effectively deal with the enormous problems which many long-term unemployed people have. I understand that in the early years, perhaps this year in particular, in the implementation of the case management system there will be a particular focus on people who have been unemployed for five years or more. The fact that there are sufficient numbers of these people to provide a focus shows the severity of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you speak to bodies that are concerned on a daily basis with helping people who have been unemployed for that long they will tell you that it can take up to two years for somebody in this situation to become job ready. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question is, though: is the program going to provide sufficient support for these people to come back into the work force? There is going to be a major preoccupation by the government with people who have been unemployed for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A culture of unemployment has grown up. The first question that will have to be answered by this system is whether a focus on these people through the case management system as implemented under this legislation is going to provide these individuals with sufficient support. All I report to the House tonight is that I have found that those bodies that are implementing case management in their own way in the community are sceptical. A very widespread scepticism exists. The question has been raised with me on a number of occasions whether case management as understood in this legislation is going to be case management as it is understood by these agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feature of case management and the philosophy of case management is, as the minister says, to attempt to address all the needs of the unemployed person. The unemployed person needs to be assisted on the basis of his total life situation. The whole person needs to be taken into account in suggesting appropriate programs. There is going to be enormous pressure in this case management system to get numbers of people through it. Whether or not there will be sufficient time available for the case manager to provide the sort of individualised support which is absolutely necessary for people who have been out of the work force for five years or more, let alone some briefer period, remains to be seen. That is one of the great challenges this system faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly a feeling at the moment that the white paper is coming into position very slowly. I think it is true to say that the white paper does not exist in practical terms in the CES, let alone in the wider community. The training is not yet there and the system of assessing whether or not unemployed people are at risk and whether they are suitable for entry into the case management system is still not in place. The CES is currently relying on old, previously existing systems. The information about how the system is to work is not available and the CES does not know whether offices are going to get additional resources when they move staff into the case management system. All these questions are very much in the minds of CES managers around Australia at the present time. I have found that they do not know the answers to these questions at the moment. They are waiting for the white paper to arrive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that there are delays in the appointment of case managers. I understand that the target for the number of case managers to be appointed by December this year is between 3,000 and 3,500. At the end of July, I believe, there were some 1,400 case managers appointed. It is quite possible&mdash;and this is another challenge that the government faces&mdash;that the target for the number of case managers will not be met by the end of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are presently some 35,000 people in case management because the case management system was established in some form within DEET before the release of the white paper. However, there are another 49,000 people on the waiting list. These case managers are faced with a huge load. Not all of them are full time; most of them are either untrained or undertrained; and many of them, I understand, are attempting to deal with newstart interviews as well. At present, a huge load is being placed on the CES. It is running behind schedule, and there is every possibility that the white paper will be extremely slow to get into operation. Indeed, in relation to the long-term unemployed, the white paper intends a very long phase-in period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also understand that the initial work on the job seekers assessment instrument has not been going smoothly and that people presently in case management have been selected according to the old criteria and may not fall within the target group. DEET has never been known for its capacity to manage data with integrity. My understanding is that there are very significant problems with the information that is coming through and being entered into the system. It has been mentioned to me&mdash;and I do not know whether it is true&mdash;that possibly up to 50 per cent of cases have incomplete data, which would make it extremely difficult for them to be properly handled within the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a large number of practical concerns about the arrangements, but there are also concerns about the strategy which is being adopted. I will illustrate my point by drawing the attention of the House to the concerns of many people in the skillshare area and other programs for training unemployed people. Under the arrangements to be set in place by this legislation, the case managers will be asked, they understand, to focus their attention on people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more and, in the first instance, possibly people who have been unemployed for much longer than 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I have asked these people what the implication of this proposal is, the answer I have received is that it is a system which will inevitably create more long-term unemployed people. Once we focus our efforts on people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more, we are simply not going to be able to offer assistance to those that we have been assisting up until now&mdash;those that have been unemployed for less than that time, possibly six months or 12 months. We are receiving no additional resources and our existing resources will be diverted into the target groups that the white paper has identified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a quite common belief amongst the skillshare bodies that I have been to. I would be very pleased if you were because there is great concern about this point. The legislation also ranges very widely in setting up a contracting out system for case management. And the coalition applauds this initiative. It is good that the government has moved in the direction that we outlined before the last election, which is to assist unemployed people through the mechanism of contracting out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In establishing this system, however, the government has put in place a body known as ESRA which has exceedingly wide and extensive powers. This body will be able to regulate the case management system, define the conditions of accreditation, stipulate codes of practice, effect terminations, inspect premises, search and withdraw items, and seek reimbursement of debts from a contracted agency. It will have the power to investigate matters relating to the operation of the case management system. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will be empowered to investigate complaints about contracted case managers. Both agencies will have the power to refer complaints to the other and will be expected to enter into a memorandum of understanding which will set out detailed arrangements for referral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is because of these new and sweeping powers that have been accorded ESRA, including the very laudable objective of ensuring that fraud does not occur within the system, that we believe that this piece of legislation should be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs so that there is an opportunity for those agencies that may participate in the case management system to make representations and express their views and so that we can ensure that the very wide-ranging authority given to ESRA will be exercised in a way that is both appropriate to prevent fraud and appropriate to encourage the development of the private or non-government case management system which is envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has already expressed concern about the way in which ESRA has been established and the appointment of former Victorian Premier Mrs Joan Kirner as the head of the board. Mrs Kirner has no formal business experience and is well known for her negative attitude towards the private sector. I do not believe that her appointment will give a great deal of confidence that ESRA is going to operate in a way that will really establish a competitive case management market. In the coalition's view, the appointment of Mrs Kirner merely confirms that the white paper is more about repackaging and representing the politicians responsible for Australia's high unemployment policies than it is about offering genuine hope for victims of those policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also draw to the minister's attention the concern expressed to me by voluntary agencies which may well be interested in offering case management that they will become policemen on behalf of the government in terms of monitoring the activity agreements and that this will interfere with their relationships with their clients which they have built up over a long period. This fear very definitely needs to be addressed, and presumably will be considered by ESRA in establishing the system. If these fears are not allayed, it may be difficult to get these voluntary agencies to finally offer to become case managers under the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the terms of the legislation, I think this is a real fear because there are responsibilities on these contracted case managers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Employment Services Bill, which is before the House, and object most strenuously to the amendment that has just been moved. I would like to say a number of things about this bill because I think it is a very exciting piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened intently to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), who is the shadow spokesperson on education. I am sure that he will not mind my saying that I thought it was the most pessimistic speech that I have heard in this House for a long time. I asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), who was sitting next to me at the time, whether I could re-read his second reading speech because I thought that it must have contained the same points that he mentioned in an answer he gave to this House yesterday with respect to the long-term unemployed when he said that the statistics, which are public knowledge, have shown very clearly that 41,000 people have now found jobs over the last year and that 76,000 people have found jobs since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein blamed this government for the recession, for the divorce rate and for the suicide rate. I was waiting for him to blame us for the drought. I thought that may be something that the government has not taken the blame for. Perhaps he should have added that in his speech. What more does he expect this government to do? We now have about five per cent economic growth and 1.7 per cent inflation, and yet we have this type of negative approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Goldstein said that he had been talking to the unemployed and to skillshare groups. He should come to New South Wales and we will show him what is happening, where it is happening and why it is happening. Quite frankly, what is happening is quite different from the message that I was getting very clearly and loudly from the honourable member for Goldstein. The government has introduced many programs, and many opportunities will be provided by this bill before the House and the white paper. I say to the honourable member that, when we present so-called facts in this House, we should make sure that they are facts. I have full confidence in what the minister said both yesterday and today in his second reading speech. He made an honest and factual remark which is backed up by the statistics and the information that is readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to change with respect to CES employees and our skillshare people. If we had listened to some of our population, we would never have got out of the caves. Sure, people do not want change. But the government has shown very clearly through legislation that we acknowledge that there are problems out there. We acknowledge that we have a very high unemployment rate and, most particularly, we acknowledge that steps need to be taken, and we intend to take them. That is what this bill before the House is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it has to be phased in, as far as our case managers are concerned. We just cannot magically pluck that many skilled people out of the air overnight and say, `Here they are; here's the problem; here's the solution; here's how we're going to do it.' It must be phased in. This government and this minister would be condemned if it were not phased in. We need to have a commonsense approach in how we tackle a problem that has not been created overnight; it is a problem that has been there for quite some time. It is a problem that has been fully acknowledged by our government, and we are now taking steps to overcome it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I greatly support the skillshare programs and what they are able to achieve. Ironically, I am getting reports from skillshare programs in my electorate and in neighbouring electorates that they look to this as an opportunity for them to expand the expertise which they have had an opportunity of developing through the programs which we have created and then take that expertise and that knowledge one step further by going to the next area, which is to help those long-term unemployed. They have repeatedly come to local and federal government members and said, `We have the expertise. Give us a go; give us the right to do it.' This bill and the white paper will provide that opportunity for those people to come forward. As the minister said, they will not have a gun at their head and be obligated to come forward. It will be those who choose to do it. I can assure honourable members that a lot of people out there are waiting to choose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to what the bill before the House is all about. Unemployment is this government's highest policy priority. Our Working Nation white paper is the most comprehensive and coherent challenge to this problem in the Western world. Working Nation is about the future of this country. As the 21st century approaches, this government realises that what we do for the remainder of this decade will determine the sort of Australia that enters into the next century. Furthermore, it will be our future, and not an imposed future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very dynamic piece of legislation. I believe that it underlines what the white paper was about. It is no bandaid. This bill and the white paper are about the restoration of certainty. They are about the development of our young people and the enhancement of our existing work force through training and education. They are about new skills and new capabilities for our working people. But they are more than this. They establish a framework for providing a sustained attack on the problems associated with persons trapped in that long-term unemployment circle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is a call to all Australians for new thinking, for new attitudes and for renewed commitment to doing the right thing for those who will come after us. That goes for employers, governments and workers. I believe that circumscribing this commitment is the retention of those fundamental values of fairness, decency and compassion. Regrettably, these values seem to have been lost on those opposite, as their very tepid response to the Working Nation proposal continues. I believe the opposition's absence of any strategic focus for tackling the future of the nation is highlighted by the presentation of this bill and the comments of the shadow spokesperson on employment and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill does not come out of thin air. It is the product of more than a decade of Labor government which has delivered a restructured, internationalised economy. It is a Labor government which has delivered phenomenal job growth. Some 1.6 million jobs were created between 1983 and 1990 and a further 360,000 jobs have been created since the last election. It is a government which has delivered industrial harmony, higher productivity, enterprise bargaining, economic certainty and secure award based safety nets. We can add to this the accelerated participation opportunities in post-secondary education and training, and vast improvements to the social security system and health and housing infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to remind the House and in particular our colleagues opposite, as I have done on a number of occasions, that significant advances are now being made by women at every level of society under the direction and the guidance of this government. It is our government that remains committed to tackling the tough issues associated with the rights of and the opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, the disabled, our ethnic communities and all of those people who make up our multicultural Australia in the 1990s. It is only a Labor government that could have cared sufficiently to make the changes that were necessary to ensure that our society remains fair, decent and prosperous. This bill now extends that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the central objectives lying behind this piece of legislation. I ask that those opposite recall the framework outlined a few moments ago within which Labor strategic planning is undertaken as we examine the key objectives underpinning this legislation and the programs that will deliver them. The Employment Services Bill enables the creation of a sophisticated, competitive job placement system to aid job seekers who are either at risk of becoming long-term unemployed or are already listed as long-term unemployed. It is a welcome further addition to that framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Five hundred thousand job seekers will be eligible for case management in 1994-95. Working Nation is designed to ensure that unemployed people share in the economic recovery. The committee on employment opportunities in its paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Restoring full employment</EMPHASIS> estimates that the combination of economic recovery, case management and proper screening can reduce the pool of long-term unemployed by 75 per cent by the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Case management draws on specialist skills available in the community and the private sector to assist the unemployed move through the appropriate cycle to employment. Organisations associated with people from non-English speaking backgrounds, people with disabilities, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will have the opportunity, subject to the appropriate accreditation, of becoming case managers on a fee-for-service basis. To prevent the very young falling into long-term unemployment, the youth training initiative coupled with the individual case management will help ensure that newly unemployed young people gain access to suitable education, training or work experience opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compassion, fairness and decency with equity and access are the hallmarks of this government and they are certainly the linchpin of this bill before the House. The programs flowing from the passage of this bill will fulfil the objective of maximising the opportunities for all Australians to participate in the nation's prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the next four years we will be spending a total of $10.3 billion in employment and training initiatives. There was never a better opportunity for business to increase staff levels and productivity. Of the $10.3 billion to be spent over those four years, $3.17 billion, over 30 per cent, will go directly to employers in the form of staff subsidies. This is not a handout. Training must be structured, portable and certified. Training itself will be responsive to the requirements of the employers. By 1995-96 there will be some 360,000 labour market program places per year available for non-compact unemployed people. Added to this, government funding will provide support for 94,000 apprentices and trainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joy of speaking to this bill is the fact that it is designed to address the day-to-day concerns experienced every day in the electorate office. I have seen first-hand the obstacles faced by our young people, migrants, disabled and older workers in an economy which is changing rapidly. I have also seen the benefits to my electorate of the government's training, education and employment policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retention rates at school to year 12 are so high that I now have the three largest high schools in New South Wales within my electorate of Prospect. University enrolments increased 115 per cent between 1986 and 1991. TAFE college enrolments in the city of Fairfield increased in the same period by 61 per cent. The value of education and training as a pathway to work is recognised by the men and women of the Prospect electorate. It will give them great heart to see the vigour with which the government is now tackling that very vexed question of long-term unemployment as well as enhancing the post-secondary vocational options for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Complementary legislation, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill, is soon to be introduced by my colleague the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) via the Main Committee in this session. This legislation picks up and develops the white paper commitment to training. Coupled with changes to the social security legislation, the government's legislative program will make the unemployment system more responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1995-96 there will be, as I have said, some 360,000 labour market programs places per year available. Added to this, we have given support to our apprentices. I believe that with this legislation the fundamentals are now in place for sustained economic recovery. Low inflation is now recognised. We have declining unemployment; successful industrial relations and trade policies; and the right macro-economic settings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of a rigorous, independent employment services regulatory authority to promote competition between case managers to accredit, evaluate and regulate the case management system and to advise government on the progress of the system is timely. It is another link in the chain that sees industry, government and workers embracing a future that is founded on compassion, fairness and decency and is a recognition of the rights of all Australians to prosper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I commend the bill to the House, there are two areas in what the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) had to say which I would like to touch on briefly. One concerns the huge load of CES officers. He said that no-one is now able to handle the workload in the CES offices because of what we are doing with this job compact. I would like to say to him that the load they are experiencing is what they are already carrying. The job compact will relieve that once the case managers are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is the input of the CES, with the assistance of the government, that has brought this type of legislation into being. Those officers are at the coalface; they see the problems. They also see how they can readily adjust to what we believe are the solutions for the future. That is a tremendous input from our workers in the CES offices. At times people in my office have also said they have been stressed by some of the problems they have been experiencing, but they certainly welcome the white paper and the initiatives of this bill. They are only too ready and too happy to be involved in what our government sees as the future for our long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the bill before the House. I ask the opposition to be a little more generous of spirit and, when they speak, to compliment or commend the minister and the government on the legislation&mdash;and to also be factual. I very publicly commend the minister and the government for the legislation which is now before this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to participate in this debate in the most constructive way possible because, quite frankly, members on this side of the House lament very much the situation where we have so many young people unemployed and so many people with so little in the way of a future. The sort of future that was available to me, my spouse, members of my family and my contemporaries is not available to young people today. I see that in my own home as my children compete with so many others for the few opportunities that are available for young people in our community. It does have a very dispiriting effect and is a matter of very real concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that I come to discuss the Employment Services Bill. I ask the government to do a good deal more than speak about the bill in generalities and a good deal more than the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) did. I would have liked to hear her speak about these matters in the context of the area in which she has some portfolio responsibility. There are a number of questions I wish to raise about the government's schema. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a point that is not meant to be uncharitable. The editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 5 May posed a real question about the white paper and the job compact that was to be developed out of it. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The job compact is to be welcomed for what it is&mdash;a sort of up-market bandaid for those who most need it. But we are entitled to be a little sceptical: will this elaborate job program be of any greater effect than the many programs that have gone before?</PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the situation that we face. Undoubtedly, long-term unemployment is one of the worst social problems of our time. What must not be forgotten when debating these new so-called radical approaches that the government is putting forward is that the government is desperately attempting to find a cure for a problem which in my view is purely a creation of its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with only half the story. The operation of the job compact will be reliant upon a great deal more information than we have at this stage. It will be reliant upon guidelines and disallowable instruments which we have not seen. Undoubtedly, people are having to work on those matters at the moment. I suspect that the reason we are not seeing the complete guidelines is that people are still not really sure about how the system will operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Regulatory Authority that we have heard about is still something of a mystery. This body will be responsible for regulating the case management system within both the private and the public sector. While the bill informs us of the functions this new body would perform, we are not informed about how it would operate. So far it is really a shell. Until we see its internal workings, we will not know a great deal about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question has been raised as to what sort of people will be able to become case managers. After all, this is a vitally important part of the workings of this system. I do not think that is yet to be seen. Some people have said that skillshare folk are looking forward to playing a part in this, and I think the private sector was mentioned in the white paper. We still do not know the nature of the people who will be appointed, the skills that they will bring and their ability to manage these tasks. These things will be crucial to the success of this system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These case managers will be required to negotiate a case management activity agreement with a job seeker. We have an accreditation scheme which is to be set out as a disallowable instrument, but ESRA will have the power to accredit managers. We are yet to see the disallowable instrument, and we know little about the qualifications to be required in this important position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we know is that a case manager may not demand or receive any fees from a job seeker for the provision of case management services; a case manager must lodge a case management activity agreement with the CES; and a case manager must provide information to the secretary to DEET concerning a job seeker's compliance with a case management activity agreement. The job compacts will have the consequence of reducing long-term unemployment figures&mdash;albeit artificially, because no new jobs are being created as a result of this process. We are dealing with programs. In part, we are largely changing definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not difficult to be cynical about any claim by this Labor government that it has reduced unemployment, because one of Labor's major achievements under this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been to introduce a number of new measures and benefits which take people off unemployment statistics without actually finding them a job. Because of the way in which this matter is being addressed, the complexity of it, and the fact that we have a totally new department that will be handling the income support arrangements and setting up a totally new regulatory regime, I suspect that this process will only compound even more all of the difficulties which we have seen to date in relation to other initiatives for compiling unemployment statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The job compact will increase the complexity of the process through which unemployed people will have to go. The case management activity agreement will be the third agreement which an unemployed person may have to sign in the space of a year or so. At the moment these people have to do so in relation to jobsearch agreements and, after 12 months, newstart agreements. Now they will have a third situation&mdash;a case management activity agreement&mdash;with a different authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, through this legislation&mdash;and I refer particularly to clause 32&mdash;people will be asked to sign an activity agreement for certain activities approved by the employment secretary. It is very difficult to find any substantial difference between what is proposed here for an activity agreement and what is proposed in relation to the jobsearch agreements and newstart agreements which are already negotiated with the social security department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of interest to me is that one of the activities which it might be proposed people undertake&mdash;it was referred to in the white paper&mdash;is voluntary work. It is very interesting that we have had a situation where voluntary work has been an available option under these jobsearch and newstart agreements&mdash;all of the other employment activities that can be chosen here are of similar character&mdash;yet in relation to those programs which are working already in the social security area we have no substantial evidence that they have been able to achieve significantly different outcomes. One has to ask the question: what is so different now about the terms of the case management activity agreements that are being proposed under this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the central point I wish to make in relation to this particular legislation. I do not know the inner workings of the bureaucracy and how initiatives such as Working Nation emerge from the processes through which they are developed. Clearly, the Department of Social Security had a role, as did the industry departments. If we look at Working Nation we find that there are numbers of changes to social security payments. One could address those matters in debates on other legislation which will undoubtedly come before the parliament later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of material in relation to the regional development strategy, there is a little material in relation to industry development policies, but when we read the material in relation to development of the youth training arrangements, which we are discussing under the ambit of the Employment Services Bill tonight, we find that there is nothing that explains why these particular initiatives have been developed in the context of moving the income support arrangements from the Department of Social Security to the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the way in which these new arrangements have been developed, we see that we are faced with a minefield of problems for administration, for the unemployed and for those people who want to understand the unemployment difficulties that people experience in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be interrupted shortly, but when I resume my remarks&mdash;presumably tomorrow&mdash;I will take the House through some of the administrative difficulties that arise through the structure the government has brought forward without any attempt to justify it. I would have liked to have heard from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security as to why the government is developing a separate payment arrangement through a new department. It will be administered through the Department of Social Security, it will have different appeal arrangements to those that normally apply in relation to social security areas, it will create enormous difficulty in terms of understanding the new administrative law-making regime and it has the potential to develop legislative inconsistency between the employment services legislation and that which operates in the social security area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officers of the Department of Social Security, who have to administer this program in addition to understanding all of the nuances of the legislation, will have to have the capacities to deal with the new arrangements under this legislation and all the problems that result from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That seems to me to be a major move and I hoped the minister in his second reading speech might have given us some understanding of why a substantial part of the income support arrangements that are provided in Australia for the unemployed need to be administered by a separate department under this new, complex arrangement. I think they are important questions that the government will have to address and answer in relation to this legislation. When I continue, I will certainly detail some of the greater complexities that are yet to be addressed in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are now working through the many 50-year anniversaries of the Second World War towards the centenary of Federation in 2001 as we search to establish our place in the world. The year 1995 is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which was probably the most cataclysmic event of the 20th century. But 1995 is also being celebrated as the centenary of probably an even more important event&mdash;the invention of the cinema.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The invention of moving pictures has been, for better or worse, arguably the major influence in the cultural, artistic, social and political life of the century. It has virtually swamped all other art forms and means of communication. Indeed, Australians are amongst the most avid consumers of movies in the world. It is estimated that Australians saw films 1.8 billion times in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the cinema has been an international force cutting across parochial nationalism, nevertheless our cultural identity both here and abroad has largely been shaped by our film industry. The cinema became the dominant mass medium in the first half of the 20th century. Since then, its death knell has been forecast many times, but it has shown an amazing resilience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film industry passed through the advent of TV in the 1950s, the video revolution of the 1980s and is facing an explosion of new technologies in the 1990s. Yet in recent years it has embarked on its first major expansion plan since the 1930s with the development of many new venues throughout the country. The cinema remains a crucial element in Australia's cultural life, acting as a showcase for other outlets, such as broadcast television, videos and pay television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Western countries, such as France and the United Kingdom, have seen fit to mark out and celebrate the centenary of the cinema for similar reasons. In France, the centenary is a major cultural landmark where a multiplicity of events have been funded and planned between 1994 and 1996 with the full backing of its ministry of arts. This includes special film seasons, lectures, symposiums, exhibitions, publications and other works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the value attached to the heritage of the Australian cinema and the support given over the last 20 years by successive state and federal governments, it is fitting that the Australian government should make a special financial allocation to support a range of projects not only to celebrate this significant centenary but also to understand the history of cinema with all its cultural import and ramifications. The centenary of cinema offers the possibility of various projects to help place Australian cinema within a global context and to disentangle the mystique that has pervaded this cultural phenomenon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the Australian Centenary of Cinema Committee was formed to coordinate and network the variety of activities that will mark the centenary of cinema in 1995-96. This committee represents a complete spectrum of notable persons drawn from the film industry, the education sector, heritage institutions and film funding bodies. The committee believes that the centenary of cinema is far more than a simple anniversary. It is an opportunity to extend and enhance cultural understanding in the best sense, focusing on not only the achievements of Australian cinema but also the cultural dynamics that have made world cinema such an enduring phenomenon. It wants all Australians to know and take pride in their heritage and the achievement of putting Australia on the screens of the world. </PARA>

This is one of the more outstanding and worthwhile projects of recent years and will provide enormous benefits to Australia in terms of Australian arts and cultural life, our heritage and the film industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is almost a year ago since I moved a private member's motion opposing proposals from Japan, Norway, Iceland and other countries favouring the resumption of commercial whaling, and calling for support of the French proposal for the creation of a whale sanctuary in all waters south of 40 degrees south latitude. I am very pleased to be able to stand here tonight and say that the latter of these two objectives has been largely realised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 May this year, the International Whaling Commission voted 23 to one in favour of the creation of the sanctuary,  which links with the existing Indian Ocean sanctuary. The new sanctuary covers 21 million square kilometres of the southern ocean, where 90 percent of the world's whales go to feed. This means that more than one-third of the world's oceans are now a safe haven for these magnificent animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Future generations will recognise with gratitude the position that the Australian government took on the issue of the sanctuary. The energy and enthusiasm for the proposal shown by the government, environmental organisations and particularly the former minister for the environment, the honourable member for Canberra (Ros Kelly), in their well-documented support for the sanctuary ideal went a long way towards realising the goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that the sanctuary will protect some 450 blue whales&mdash;the majority of the estimated wild population of this, the largest species, which is down from the pre-hunting level of an estimated 300,000. The sanctuary will also protect 2,000 right whales of which there were originally 100,000; 2,000 pygmy blue whales; 4,000 fin whales of which there were originally 500,000; 4,000 sei whales out of an original population of 160,000; 12,000 humpback whales, a large proportion of which travel up and down the coasts of Australia each year, from an original estimated population of 150,000; 700,000 minke whales; and 100,000 killer whales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plight of the blue whale is particularly precarious, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature has said that it fears that the sanctuary may have arrived too late to save this already very rare species. Its numbers have been so decimated that it may not be able to increase its numbers sufficiently from such a small breeding population. So the move by the government to devote more scientific resources to monitoring whale numbers is also very welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From an Australian point of view, the decision on the sanctuary means that whales in Australian waters will have protection from the Antarctic to the tip of Cape York. Any  move which benefits the whales will ultimately benefit Australian coastal communities as well. These cities and towns were once members of one of Australia's first major export industries&mdash;the whaling industry. The whales are still returning money and jobs in areas such as Hervey Bay, Maryborough, and even Brisbane's Moreton Bay. This is also happening at places such as Byron Bay in the north of New South Wales. In the months ahead, people will be able to go to those parts of Australia to see the whales returning. The whale watching industry has been estimated to be worth in excess of $30 million per year, and it is still only in its early stages. This places Australia third in the world in regard to whale watching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I would like to bring to the House's attention the current moves under way in Russia. About a week ago a story broke that the Russian fisheries department is lobbying its government to join Japan in protesting against the sanctuary, even though the Russians supported the sanctuary at the IWC. Russia has already lodged an objection to the worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling. It was a matter of great concern to me when the World Wildlife Fund's chief executive officer in Australia said last week that these moves could allow the Russians to hunt limited numbers of minke whales in the sanctuary and to sell the meat to Japan without either country breaking the rules of the conventions or having to leave the IWC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are real concerns that we, as a nation, should be aware of, given Australia's important stance in protecting whales. As I said before, whales are very important to the tourist industry in Queensland in particular and to many towns on the northern New South Wales coast. Some of the recent television news coverage of whales off our coast has been quite outstanding. I pay a compliment to the media for the way in which it has covered many of the aspects of the visit by whales along our coastlines. It is very important that we should try to support the environmental groups that have been so outstanding in their efforts to protect these animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate the major environmental organisations in this country and around the world for their unflinching devotion to the wellbeing of these magnificent creatures. I wish them well in their long-term determination. I hope that Australia will continue to support them, which I am sure we will under our new minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on behalf of Reg and Sylvia Faulkner, who have been residents of Fairlight in my constituency for many years. They have been reduced to virtual destitution because they believed that the Commonwealth's word was its bond. Unfortunately, this matter has a long and tortuous history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To simplify it, the matter began when Sylvia Faulkner invented an award-winning clip with wide application in industry. On the strength of representations made by the senior army officer in charge of procurement&mdash;that the army would purchase this clip&mdash;the Faulkners invested everything they owned in its production. The army failed to act on the representations made, failed to order the clip and, as a result, the Faulkners were bankrupted. Naturally, the Faulkners sued through the Official Trustee in Bankruptcy. Unfortunately, this was only the beginning of their troubles. I quote from a document concerning this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me give some examples of maladministration . . . In the area of civil action, the classic case has been the Faulkner litigation . . . It is an action in contract for damages brought initially in 1974. The matter wallowed along in the Crown Solicitor's division with no action being taken . . . I took up the matter in 1981. I have had an extraordinary saga of unanswered correspondence ever since.</PARA>
<PARA>The speaker went on to list a series of letters and follow-up letters, all of which were fobbed off. That speaker was Senator Gareth Evans, who said this back in 1982. I mention this not to score a political point but to stress that it is high time that justice finally be done for a couple who are now old, tired and sick. Before the matter finally came to court in the mid-1980s, Greg Woods QC said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the first part of the claim will, in my view, undoubtedly succeed with very substantial damages.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact the claim failed. In part, it failed because the Commonwealth was able to discredit Reg Faulkner as a witness on the basis of allegations that Faulkner made, which the Commonwealth knew at the time to be true but which it ridiculed in court. Documents subsequently obtained reveal that the relevant army officer admitted that he had represented to the Faulkners that the army would purchase the clip. In other words, the Commonwealth knew that the central fact in the Faulkner's claim was true, yet it denied it in court. Further documents reveal that the relevant army officer, who left the army under most questionable circumstances, was `required to say he acted without authority' when making this representation to the Faulkners in order to receive his pension. The Commonwealth not only knew that the Faulkners' central contention was true, but the Commonwealth also placed pressure on a key witness to deny that very truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my purpose to exhume old wrongs and question the actions of officials who have long since left public office just to correct a continuing injustice. The current Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) strikes me as an honourable man who would rather correct an injustice than bury it in the bureaucracy and wait for death to remove the complainants. I have been informed by my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who has taken a close interest in this matter for several years, that the Attorney has recently rejected the Faulkners' latest plea for justice. I suspect that this was done on departmental advice and not on the personal involvement of the Attorney. I just cannot believe that the minister would be so hard-hearted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure whether the Faulkners have totally exhausted all their legal remedies, but I am sure that they have totally exhausted their time, their money and their strength. I ask that the Attorney-General return to this matter, personally review the conduct of this case and renew the settlement offer which was made in 1987&mdash;but which was disgracefully withdrawn after the Commonwealth realised that the Faulkners lacked the finances to prosecute their case. This is a blot on the Commonwealth's record, and it should be remedied before it is too late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today, just before question time commenced, I had a brief opportunity to refer to the Aboriginal athlete, Cathy Freeman, who today won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games, and who was attacked by the opposition for carrying an Aboriginal flag in her lap of honour. I had not seen the event at the time, but I have since caught up with the incident on television and would like to add to my comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, on behalf, I believe, of all decent Australians let me congratulate Cathy Freeman on her gold medal in the women's 400 metres. Cathy is the first Aboriginal woman to win any individual event in the Commonwealth Games history. There is no finer role model for Australian sports men and women, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal than Cathy Freeman. Her achievement is something of which all Australians should be proud. In particular, it is a moment that should and no doubt will be treasured by Australia's indigenous people for whom Cathy Freeman is a proud representative and ambassador. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy's victory is certainly something for Cathy and all Australians to celebrate, particularly our indigenous people. But what do we hear from the federal opposition? The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) in this chamber today, attacked Cathy Freeman for daring to carry an Aboriginal flag on her lap of honour. This is yet another typical example of the ignorance, insensitivity and downright prejudice displayed by many of those opposite towards indigenous Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make a number of points about this. Firstly, as I said earlier, the spirit of these events, whether Commonwealth or Olympic Games, is first and foremost about individual sports people&mdash;the best sports people in th world&mdash;competing against each other, not so much about national representation, or who wins the most gold medals. So if an individual athlete chooses to carry an Aboriginal flag, a Union Jack, any other flag or no flag at all, that is surely his or her perfect individual right. We hear a lot from the Liberal Party about being the party of the individual but when it comes to the crunch, it fails the test every time on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Cathy Freeman did in fact carry both the Aboriginal and the Australian flag on her lap of honour. Surely under the unique circumstances involved in this special moment in history, this action was entirely appropriate&mdash;any reasonable person would say so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is impossible to put into words, especially for a non-Aboriginal person like me, the significance of this achievement for indigenous Australians, and the pride they must feel. We hear a lot about symbolism, and of the importance of our current national flag for those Australians who fought for Australia in wars, or indeed for that matter, those Australians who represented their country in sport. We especially hear a lot of rhetoric from the opposition about this. So surely even the opposition can understand that Aboriginal people, too, have their symbols and that their flag means a lot to them. The sight of Cathy Freeman carrying that flag around the stadium would have swelled the hearts and brought tears to the eyes of many Australians of all backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition will never ever learn. Look what happened when the leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) went to Central Australia. He made a complete fool of himself and the Liberal Party, on the question of Aboriginal issues&mdash;so much so that he has now been banished from any comment on any social policy. That is hardly surprising after his performance in Central Australia. But the opposition will never learn and it will never change. That is becoming increasingly obvious in this term of parliament since I have been here. The opposition will never learn and it will never change, and that is why the current federal Liberal Party will never govern Australia again. It is sad that this had to be a political issue, but let us all congratulate Cathy Freeman on a fantastic achievement and one that we should all be very proud of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again this government has demonstrated its executive style and arrogant indifference to governing Australia through the imposition of a decision affecting an area near Woomera in my electorate without consulting the people of the region. That decision dealt with the dumping of nuclear waste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has called this a temporary waste site; however, I believe that the sudden decision taken without public consultation shows at best poor management and at worst very deceptive politics. In 1992 the government first called for public consultation on where to put the waste now stored at Lucas Heights. This year, the government named a number of potential sites. Woomera was one of those sites. Another site was a station in South Australia, Billa Kallina, which is also in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the House may be interested to know how the station owners found out that their land had been listed as a potential nuclear waste site. The first they heard was when they were contacted by the local radio station and, unfortunately, that is the style of this government. The government pays little attention to what people are thinking and certainly does not ask them. This week we found out that, due to some court action in New South Wales, things apparently had to be speeded up. There was no time for public consultation. The nuclear waste must be removed from Lucas Heights within the next five months. So, circumventing the consultative process, the government promptly decided to temporarily store the waste at Woomera, apparently for a couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first question was: why can the government not find a permanent site for this waste within the next five months, as the court had obviously indicated that it had five months? I have been advised that it will take approximately a year for suitable below-ground storage to be built. Obviously, the site must have long-term stability and minimise risk to people's safety. I have also been advised that the government has been stalling the Lucas Heights court case for some time. Surely there was enough time to develop a contingency plan and begin work on an alternative storage site. After all, the government had been working on this waste storage project since 1992. Yet this government has now found itself with only five months to do something with the nuclear waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like the government suddenly finding out this week that its shipping line had gone broke. I suppose the Australian people will clearly remember Mr Wran's $3,000 per day fee. Little wonder there are grave doubts about the government's management and business abilities. It still does not answer the question of whether the public could have been consulted about the temporary site. I believe that they could have been. The government had until 30 September under the existing formula. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, this issue of nuclear waste is a highly sensitive one. Not many would like it in their own backyard. The term `nuclear waste' has negative connotations and concern has been expressed in the Woomera region that this might have an impact on tourism in the region. The waste will be stored on the rocket range away from the township; however, in the words of a local, `people do not read the fine print.' Woomera may now be associated with nuclear waste and undoubtedly will be. This is only one of the things which the people of Woomera could have considered about the site but they did not have the opportunity to have a say in the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of a court decision in New South Wales, South Australia has been forced to receive the waste on its  doorstep. As the editorial in today's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> stated, `This is not a rubbish tip for New South Wales.' The irony is that the government has had the capacity since 1992 to consult, find the permanent repository and deal with the issue. But its arrogance is too typical of its casual indifference to dealing with these individuals who just happen to be my constituents. </PARA>

I believe that this is an important subject to talk about in this place because it is through our art, music, poetry, literature, film and theatre traditions that we as a nation have established and will continue to develop for ourselves our own sense of self as a nation and as a culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the arts is fundamentally important in critical thinking and reflection about where we have come from and where we wish to go as a nation. The success of our Australian film industry over the last two decades provides strong evidence of that. As we move into the real issues in the debate concerning whether we should remain a constitutional democracy or become a republic, our own ideas about our identity will be examined and re-examined. We need to involve people from all walks of life in this process. Community theatre, which aims to take the theatre and issues to people who may not often experience theatre, is of great importance in this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australians, we want to see our values and aspirations expressed in our own ways, by Australian voices on the screen and in the theatre. The federal government has supported one area of strong growth in the arts industry over the last decade and that is the growth of community theatre. In South Australia we are fortunate to have a first-class model for community theatre. The Junction Theatre Company is located at Thebarton in the western suburbs of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vital issues that affect the lives of working people and their families are a primary focus of Junction's work. The Junction Theatre Company has always demonstrated its commitment to the values of social justice and cultural diversity. Its aim is to create accessible, innovative theatre which recognises the diversity of Australian society. Since 1984 it has grown into one of Adelaide's leading theatre companies and has provided a decade of visionary theatre to a broad audience. By working closely with a wide range of progressive community based organisations, Junction Theatre has developed powerful and comic plays which reach sections of the community traditionally untouched by theatre. Low income earners form a high percentage of Junction's audience. </PARA>

For ten years now, Junction's work has been toured to workplaces, schools, hospitals, prisons and other community centres throughout Australia. The excellence exhibited by this group is demonstrated by the company having five plays nominated for the prestigious AWGIE awards since 1990.

These acts provide the framework for the imposition of levy and export charge on horticultural products which are produced in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills, which are complementary to each other, seek to amend the existing legislation to enable levy to be collected on the basis of the area under cultivation or other horticultural inputs to the production process, such as the number of trees, shrubs, plants, bulbs, corms, or tubers under cultivation. In order for levy to be imposed in this way, it will be necessary for a presumed yield from these horticultural inputs to be specified in the regulations. The proposed amendments to the horticultural levy legislation will broaden the basis for levy collection, and will give horticultural industries greater flexibility in choosing a levy basis appropriate to their needs. </PARA>

This will enable levy to be collected from the grower, based on the presumed level of production of nashi fruit. These amendments will also enable the strawberry industry, which is considering the issue of a national levy for research and development, to consider implementing a levy, payable by the strawberry grower at the point of purchase of strawberry runners, based on the assumed production of strawberries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 enable levy to be imposed on horticultural products presumed to be produced in Australia, with the levy being collected based upon the area of production, number of trees or the cultivation of other horticultural inputs.

The amendments to the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987 specify that the export charge is not payable on chargeable horticultural products that have had levy paid on them under the Horticultural Levy Act 1987.

The government has a commitment to match levy contributions to the HRDC up to a maximum level of 0.5 per cent of the GVP or gross value production of the industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is broadly supportive of the approach taken by the government with the three bills before us: the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994, the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994 and the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994. For that reason, I seek to make only a few brief comments this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be pointed out that horticultural groups which decide themselves to raise money to fund research and development can do so through the Australian Horticultural Corporation and can receive the normal dollar for dollar research and promotion funding arrangements from the Commonwealth. The horticultural industries may also seek to have the Australian Horticultural Corporation undertake promotion on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many groups currently paying and receiving the benefits of those dollar for dollar grant arrangements. They include those industries which produce apples, pears, citrus, avocados, cherries, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, potatoes, onions and dried fruit, and nurseries. Interestingly, I understand that yesterday the apple and pear growers took a decision to pull out of the AHC. When this takes effect, presumably those growers will no longer pay levies, undertake promotion or participate in research and development projects. Both Western Australia and Tasmania have been trying for some time to persuade their organisations to take this step and it looks as though that has now finally happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each industry decides whether it wants to pay a levy. It sets the amount of levy it wants to pay and it has a great deal of discretion to determine how that levy will be collected. Some industries charge on a per tray of produce basis, others on a per tonne basis, some by the box and, in some cases, even by a levy on pot plants. The money collected is split between the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation in the manner in which the particular industry decides it wants it done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has no argument with the amendments in this bill. They had been requested by various industries to allow for more flexibility in levy collection so that levies can be collected and disbursed in the most cost efficient method for each particular industry as it sees its own area of particular advantage and its own way forward. However, while it is important to undertake research and development as well as promotion, I want to make the point this morning that some of the more important problems facing the horticultural industry are being swept under the carpet. My colleague to my immediate left in this new chamber, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), represents many of the people who are facing the problems that are being ignored and are being pushed away. I should say both my colleagues, I am sorry; I had not noticed the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) sitting there. I apologise to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1993, the then minister for primary industries established a task force in response to the Industry Commission's earlier report. That task force was asked to develop an export growth strategy for the horticultural industry based on the ongoing work of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. It seems that no-one really dissents in any significant way from the task force overview that states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with tariffs on many horticultural products being gradually reduced, and the possibility of satisfying quarantine barriers to further domestic access, domestic producers will face increasing competition from horticultural imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With current planting trends and forecast production increases, both here and overseas, Australian horticultural industries will need to concentrate their efforts on developing and maintaining export markets to remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition particularly agrees with the task force conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunities which are developing, especially in the Asia Pacific region, are not limitless and will only be available for a relatively short period of time before the distribution systems are taken up by other countries. Australian horticulture has only a short term window of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>It has now been more than six months since the task force reported, and the government has done nothing. We have no indication of where it is going; no idea of what outcome we can expect; no idea of whether the government is going to accept or act upon these recommendations. We have been warned that the window of opportunity is narrow, yet here again we have industries hung out to dry by a government that just does not seem to be able to understand that there are times when business opportunities are there for a limited time only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the recommendations ought briefly to be covered here and the question should be asked as to what is being done about them. The task force concluded that there was an urgent need for the industry to make the necessary adjustment away from the juice concentrate end of the market&mdash;where, frankly, it is broadly accepted now that Australia cannot compete&mdash;to the fresh fruit and fresh juice segments where Australia has a natural competitive advantage and has a capacity to pick up on the premiums that are available for that quality end of the market. The task force recommended that the government exempt fresh orange juice from sales tax and that drinks with more than 25 per cent of juice in their make-up be taxed at 11 per cent rather than 21 per cent. A budget has come and gone since then, but the government has done nothing and we have heard nothing about what it intends to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has had a concessional sales tax rate of 11 per cent on fruit juices with 25 per cent or more local content, and this is to be abolished at the end of this year to comply with GATT. The industry has accepted this but it is busily pleading, with precious little response from the government. It sent another letter to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) just this week pleading with the government to announce that, from 1 January next year, it will adopt the task force recommendation that fresh juices&mdash;that is to say, 100 per cent juice containing no concentrate&mdash;be exempted from sales tax. In essence, people are asking for a business opportunity for themselves, obviously, but at the same time asking for consumers to be able to enjoy natural juices without having to pay a tax on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sales tax is, of course, the government's consumption tax. That is what it is. The coalition indicated that it was prepared to exempt food, including 100 per cent pure fruit juice, from its proposed GST. The government, having run this outrageous scare campaign about what we proposed to do, hides its consumption taxes; and this is a classic example of them. From 1 January next year, unless the government acts, Australian consumers will be paying 21 per cent tax on their morning glass of orange juice. They already pay 11 per cent, but there will be a hefty 10 per cent rise. We still have no idea whether the government intends to pursue any change in response to the task force recommendations, so we can only assume that it intends to raise that tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I find the hypocrisy on the part of some of the commentators in Australia in this whole area of consumption taxes a bit hard to take. We heard the government, we heard the unions and we heard some of the churches screaming at us for taxing foodstuffs. Yet there is a vast array of taxes imposed by this government, indirect taxes on foodstuffs. They are increasing, not decreasing. We hear nothing, which raises the very important question of integrity in reporting and of the examination of just how these taxes impact, and what could be done to improve the affordability of foodstuffs including orange juices&mdash;in terms of this discussion&mdash;at a time when the industries involved desperately need some relief. How about a bit of highlighting of just what the indirect tax structure in this country actually does to the price of foodstuffs for consumers in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on to another area where there has been an abysmal lack of action, the government has failed to undertake effective bilateral trade negotiations with other countries, which might very well have opened up further markets for our horticultural products. Too many of our products still face too many problems in gaining access to other markets; and this includes many Asian markets. There are bans, tariffs and other barriers. But apart from the multilateral GATT talks, which we supported, I have to say that we have seen extraordinarily little action from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, and worryingly, there are no taxation arrangements&mdash;nor is there any indication that there will be taxation arrangements&mdash;which will encourage the horticultural industry to reduce its dependence on the domestic market and grow fruit for export. This is a very important point. The tree crop industries suffer a major taxation disadvantage compared with their counterparts in other primary industry sectors. New tree plantings are treated as capital expenditure for taxation purposes and therefore their costs cannot be claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC's 1993 report recommended quite clearly that the government remove this tax anomaly but, again, there has been no action, no indication of whether there will be any action. The window of opportunity is being recklessly disregarded again, despite the warnings that the window of opportunity will be narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When are we going to get real in this country? We want to spend money: we saw a report the other day that showed that the government's expenditure in social security areas and so forth has risen by 48 per cent in real terms since it came to government in 1983, while expenditure on infrastructure, on the wealth creating sectors of the Australian economy, which are expected to carry the burden of many of these other programs&mdash;desirable as many of them are&mdash;has faced a 16 per cent cut in real terms in outlays. That reflects this refusal on the part of the current government to acknowledge the need for an environment in which industry can expand, can take advantage of those windows of opportunities, can get real about exports&mdash;we keep hearing about the need to do it&mdash;to practically follow through in terms of policy development and taxation development, which will facilitate and encourage those wealth creation activities that we hear so much about the need for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our horticultural industries are of course part of the basis of our food processing industry. The food processing industry just happens to be our largest manufacturing sector but, to prosper, it needs a reduction in import costs so that it can compete overseas and against imports on domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of exports cannot be overemphasised. A major report, undertaken for the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry but unfortunately buried on about page 5 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> a few weeks ago, was not covered anywhere else yet should really have been written up and put under the nose of every Australian. The report indicated that the level at which a country's debt is regarded as being of critical proportions is when that debt reaches the level of 150 per cent of annual average export earnings. Australia's has reached the level of 230 per cent, and the report made the point that, despite all the smugness that is abroad about our better economic performance at the moment, it would take only quite minor disruptions to trigger a real financial crisis in this country because of that foreign debt. The foreign debt continues to grow because of our trade imbalance. Here is a classic example of a failure by the government to act in an area where both import replacement and export performance can be significantly boosted by some taxation changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1960s, it needs to be remembered, Australia was at one stage the fifth largest exporter of processed food in the world. Today we are eleventh. Despite all the crowing about our opportunities and how good we are, the fact is that we have been slipping and, in relative terms, unless somebody bites some hard bullets around this place, in the long term our decline will continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving briefly to what we have actually seen the government do in this area of reductions of costs, we find that the answer is precious little. In fact, in many areas we have found an increase in costs. I want to emphasise again that the decision in last year's budget to lift diesel&mdash;which is the transport fuel in this country&mdash;by five cents a litre over two years added another $290-odd million to the costs of processing and producing food in this country. If that was anything other than a backward step for industry competitiveness in this country, I would like to hear what it was. I hope that the following speakers will attempt to justify that decision because I would be interested to hear the justification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last 18 months we have heard no justification of those cost increases. So I challenge the government's representatives to explain and justify the increases in indirect taxes, which increase the cost of foodstuffs of consumers in this country, which limit the capacity of our food processors to compete on our domestic markets against imports and which hold back our capacity to expand into those Asian markets that we never stop hearing talked about on the other side of politics. I challenge those opposite to explain how the process has been helped by their increasing of transport costs and to tell us how that increase is going to benefit this country's economic performance, how the increase is going help people in the horticultural industries, how it is going to help the workers in this country who depend upon our biggest manufacturing sector, the food processing sector, for their employment and their standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it is about time the government looked seriously at how it can reduce input costs instead of increasing them, what it can do to get serious about opening up more effective bilateral trade negotiations, particularly in Asia, and what it can do to reduce costs and charges for business. In the context of the bills before us, no matter how good our research and development effort is&mdash;it has helped to keep agriculture at the forefront of productivity improvements in this country, where we have outstripped every other sector of the economy consistently for many years&mdash;and no matter how much we spend on promotion, if we are not competitive in terms of our cost structure, in terms of our efficiency levels, we will not be able to maximise our opportunities to compete on foreign markets, let alone on domestic markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is determined to regain our high world ranking as an exporter of processed foodstuffs. We support these bills but make it very plain that we believe that the government is inhibiting, not enhancing, the capacity of our agricultural and food processing industries in particular to compete abroad. It is about time, in the interests of the people it represents, let alone the broader Australian community, that the government bit some hard bullets and stopped putting off the hard decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the attempts of the opposition to talk down the Australian economy and specifically the rural sector, that rural sector&mdash;farming, forestry, fishing and hunting&mdash;makes a mighty contribution to the Australian economy. According to the Parliamentary Research Service background paper No. 6 of 1994, headed `Agricultural, livestock and forestry levies and charges', the gross product of the Australian rural sector in 1991-92 totalled $12.072 billion and is estimated to have totalled $13.019 billion in 1992-93. The Australian rural sector exports totalled $15.910 billion in 1991-92, are estimated to have totalled $17.570 billion in 1992-93 and are forecast to total $18.17 billion in 1993-94. The rural sector was directly responsible for employing 405,000 people in Australia in 1992-93 and is estimated to employ indirectly more than 20 per cent of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate, agriculture and rural industry is very important to the far northern industry structure. Despite encroachment of urban and tourist development in the far north, agricultural industry still accounts for over 11 per cent of Far North Queensland's regional GDP, based on 1991 figures. Agriculture employed in Far North Queensland 7,657 people in 1991, and it supports a substantial manufacturing base centred on food processing, in particular sugar milling and to a lesser extent dairy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross value of agricultural production in Far North Queensland in 1991-92 was $509 million approximately. Crops, that is, sugarcane, bananas and tobacco, at $408 million were by far the biggest contributor to the total. Sugarcane production is valued at $137 million and livestock is another large contributor at approximately $100 million. So you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, the value of the contribution by agricultural production to Australia and to my electorate in particular. Agricultural levies like those that have been discussed in this legislation make a contribution to Australian agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are dealing with three bills: the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994, the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994. I will make some comments on what I might call the legislative mechanics of these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of this chamber would be aware, the current constitution was drafted in 1901, and is certainly not accessible to the average person in the street, nor are the end results of its application always that sensible or simple. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, before our adjournment I was making a few comments about section 55 of the constitution. The section was included in the constitution to protect the interests of the Senate and to prevent the practice of tacking non-tax matters onto appropriation bills. Interestingly enough, at the time of the 1891 constitutional convention, Sir John Downer&mdash;the grandfather of the present Opposition leader&mdash;characterised section 55 as a clause to prevent `tacking'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir John Downer was a keen supporter of the Senate power throughout the convention debates. In fact, he proposed that members of the Senate would be appointed by the legislators of the states, that they would be `an aristocracy of ability, of worth', and that they would be more worthy of exercising powers than members of the House of Representatives who are elected by the people themselves `indiscriminately'. That is what Sir John Downer thought of the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Predictably, his grandson also opposed the government's omnibus Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, which would have given the Senate power to amend or initiate such tax bills, and sought instead the protection of section 55. Clearly, the whole issue would benefit greatly from some sort of constitutional reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To return to the bills before this chamber today, as I said, because of section 55 we have three main pieces of legislation in the administration of primary industries levies and charges: an imposition act, a collection act and a distribution act. An imposition act imposes or sets the levy or charge. In this case we have the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987 and the Horticultural Levy Act 1987. A collection act provides for the collection of the levy or charge imposed by an imposition act. To help rationalise the procedure, the majority of primary industries levies and charges are collected under provision of the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to this initiative, each primary industry levy and charge comprised two pieces of legislation&mdash;an act imposing the levy or charge and a collection act. The principal effect of the PILCC Act 1991 has been to do away with a separate levy or charge collection act for each levy or charge imposed. However, some stand-alone levies and charges remain. For example, tobacco charges are collected under the provision of the Tobacco Charges Assessment Act 1955 and wool charges under the provision of the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A distribution act provides for the distribution and administration of moneys collected under a collection act. For example, the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 and the Dairy Produce Act 1986 provide for the disbursement of proceeds collected under the relevant collection act. The PILCC Act 1991 provides for the collection of the levy charge imposed by the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 and the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proceeds raised by the imposition acts are apportioned between the Australian Horticultural Corporation, under the provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation, under the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies and charges were imposed by the Commonwealth at the request of the horticultural industry, and funds raised are matched by the Commonwealth up to a maximum of 0.05 per cent of the relevant industry's gross value production. The principal use of the proceeds raised by the levies includes the funding of research and development, as well as health and safety monitoring. Of course, Australia's agricultural industries are probably the most efficient in the world. They are also, compared with those in the rest of the world, relatively disease free. That is because of the tradition in Australia of providing financial assistance to research and development in the area of agricultural industries. This bill contributes to that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to say something about an industry in Far North Queensland and in my electorate in particular, and that is the tobacco industry. Tobacco growers provided $43 million in terms of value production in 1991-92 to the economy of Far North Queensland. I would like to put a few matters on the record in relation to the tobacco industry. It is certainly the case that state and federal governments&mdash;both Labor governments and coalition governments&mdash;have in the past encouraged farmers, and often these farmers have been newly arrived migrants, to go into tobacco production. The Mareeba area, which is just outside my electorate, is the largest area of tobacco production in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is validity in the argument that governments do have some responsibility to assist in structural adjustment now that there have been world changes in relation to demand for tobacco. It goes without saying that there has been a worldwide decline in tobacco use. We all know the reasons for that. There are obvious health reasons. I do not think anyone in this chamber, not even the shadow minister for health, would stand up in 1994 and say that tobacco is good for you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary does put some doubt on that. I am not sure from the shadow minister's statements, like those of the rest of the coalition, what the coalition's policy is. Nevertheless, I think everyone else agrees that there should be some discouragement, in terms of health, of tobacco use. Of course, that does not assist farmers who have been encouraged in the past to go into agricultural production in tobacco. Therefore, there has to be some form of structural adjustment in the tobacco industry. There is no doubt that tobacco farmers in my electorate, and in the neighbouring electorate of Kennedy, recognise that there have to be some changes in the industry. There is no doubt about that. I have not met a tobacco farmer who says that we can just close our eyes to the reality. So the tobacco industry does recognise the need for change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: what sort of change? There is also undoubtedly the fact that the government does collect a great deal of revenue from tobacco. Tobacco farmers point to that quite rightly when they suggest that government should provide some assistance. So obviously there has to be some change, and both sides have to accept the need for change. The tobacco industry waits with anticipation for the final report of the Industry Commission on the tobacco industry. Certainly, the initial report suggested some sort of phased out tariff assistance. In talking with people in the tobacco industry, I would say that has received qualified support from the industry. I think there is concern about the timing of that phasing out. Nevertheless, those people obviously support some sort of assistance to the tobacco industry. They perhaps recognise that the existing arrangements will not be continued, and they see structural adjustments through tariffs as one way of proceeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must, at this point, pay some tribute to the people of Mareeba in terms of highlighting the difficulties of the tobacco industry. In particular, Mr Chris Lewis, the Mayor of the Mareeba Shire Council, has been tireless in his work in support both of the tobacco industry and his community. I have done everything I can to assist Mr Lewis in supporting the tobacco industry but, more particularly, supporting some form of structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the rural adjustment scheme must play some role, but what I am putting to the Main Committee today is that there has to be some form of support in addition to RAS to assist the tobacco industry. This is because, as I said before, to some extent it has been governments that have encouraged people to go into the tobacco industry and, as I have said, it is not just coalition governments. Labor governments and others after the war encouraged people to go into tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco has smaller holdings which make it more difficult for adjustment. But government now has to play some role. Certainly I discussed these matters with Chris Lewis and government ministers and, after those discussions, I am very confident that the government does recognise the need for further assistance. That assistance, of course, is not going to be the form of assistance which simply ignores the problems, especially the declining demand for tobacco, and obviously there has to be some assistance in giving the current tobacco producers some choices to diversify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say also that the proximity of the Mareeba shire to the Cairns tourist market will provide some limited opportunities for the current tobacco farmers to participate more in the tourist industry; all these matters have to be explored. There are some tobacco farmers who have already started to diversify but as they will say, and I think anyone involved in primary production will say, it is very difficult to make any return in the short term and with a new crop. Some of these crops take some time and that is the problem. That is why those in the tobacco industry are saying that they fervently accept that they have to adjust, but they need some time to adjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very confident that with appropriate forms of government assistance, the rural adjustment scheme and the goodwill of government, both state and federal, there will be some light at the end of the tunnel for the tobacco industry. I must say that in the past I think the Bjelke-Petersen government and its successors were too interested in short-term political advantage and not interested in the long-term interests of the tobacco industry. They gave them assistance which only prolonged the non-viability of the tobacco industry in the long term. I am confident that this government will be able to provide appropriate structural assistance for the tobacco industry, allowing tobacco growers in my electorate and the electorate of Kennedy to diversify. It will not allow the Mareeba shire, which depends on the tobacco industry as a vital industry in that area, to go into economic decline. In conclusion, the government does, despite the nonsense that was put by the previous coalition speaker, support Australian rural industry. I support this bill that is currently before this chamber. </PARA>

I would also like to make those points and remind the honourable member for Leichhardt that an electorate like mine represents a significant proportion of the horticultural industries of this nation.

We will continue to put those issues before this government. The breadth of commodities produced in horticulture is incredibly diverse. Of course, this makes resolution of some of the issues much more difficult. As I have said, virtually every non-tropical horticultural produce would be produced in the Mallee in significant numbers, excluding pears and apples&mdash;and, of course, tobacco; I have no tobacco growers.

The wine industry proposes to triple its export earnings by the turn of the century. This will require an increased planting of vineyards of some 30,000 hectares which will probably be almost entirely contained in the electorates of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) and the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). It is a prime wine grape growing area in Australia which enjoys a good climate and the availability of a secure water resource and produces a quality product that honourable members of the House often enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this is new and it has not suddenly emerged. Just to put horticulture into perspective, Australia enjoys 21 per cent of world banana production. For oranges the figure is 11 per cent and for honey 24 per cent. These compare with figures for our bigger broadacre primary industries of 38 per cent for wool, from grazing, and 17 per cent for wheat. So the potential is there for enormous wealth creation for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just dwell on two major products produced in my electorate, citrus and dried vine fruit. These are valuable commodities worth at least $200 million per annum, just in my electorate, and they are being squeezed from both ends with unrelenting pressure. They are being squeezed from the market end because of the difficulty with the commodity price squeeze and from the production end because of cost pushes, which is the point that the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has made to the government. That is where this government can have some influence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you squeeze an orange too hard from both ends, it bursts. Sadly, far too many of my horticultural constituents have gone bust or are about to do so. It is flippant for the member for Leichhardt to dismiss the problem by looking at national production figures and ignoring the very real difficulties of people that are involved in intensive horticulture, often in smallholdings. We know that, in terms of advantages of size, that is something that cannot continue, but these are real people caught in that commodity squeeze and cost squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can choose to hide from its responsibility by claiming little influence over world commodity prices. However, as I have said, it has direct control over cost inputs and I think it is time for it to accept that responsibility. That is what previous coalition speakers have said, and no doubt following speakers from our side will continue to make that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fancy the government forcing a massive hike in fuel prices by forced excise increases, if it purports to be concerned about horticulture. Despite the request from the member for Gwydir, nobody from the other side has yet attempted to defend those budget decisions. Fancy imposing a superannuation guarantee charge on itinerant labour, from which the only beneficiaries have been fund managers and insurance companies. It shows a lack of recognition of the particular seasonal labour requirements in horticulture. Fancy having a dog in a manger attitude to every form of taxation depreciation proposal put forward by those industries, whose only intention is a desperate bid to survive, seeking any small fillip to encourage them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fancy abolishing tariff control on imported citrus and dried fruit without assisting those industries to adjust. The revenue for citrus is now as low as $40 per tonne for juicing product when the cost of production is of the order of $150 a tonne. I have a complete file of growers' payment remittance advices that have been sent to me as examples of the problem they face. One particular grower sent me his payment remittance advice which was in fact in the negative. For 26.3 tonnes of product for juicing, he received a bill for $183. That is a situation that is completely untenable for an industry that has accepted the challenge of the new free international trade ideology and has accepted the challenge of removing the fortress structures of the past but is simply seeking some level of assistance to adjust. I hold the view that Australia has paid an enormous price by steadfastly reducing its barriers, and that this has been disproportionately paid by particularly the citrus growers and dried fruit growers in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with horticulture is that when one is faced with a pack-out of citrus, where one attempts to produce a premium fresh product for exporting and the domestic market, the pack-out is only of the order of 60 per cent. In other words, only 40 per cent of what is produced can be packed for a fresh market. The remaining 60 per cent goes to the juice industry. This is because the industry has not kept pace with sufficient new varieties and needs to replant. That is why this legislation supporting the broadening of the base of levy collections for research and development is a very important step in advising growers on new varieties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply ripping out trees or vines and planting new ones does not ensure one's income, and often it takes from five to seven years before a first crop can be produced. This is a real difficulty for horticulture, which is faced with the need to be more efficient, to use varieties which are more amenable to mechanical harvesting, and to produce a much better fresh fruit product. I do not think this government has recognised that. It does not seem to have recognised the need for restructure in an industry that it has forced onto a purportedly level playing field in free world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the end result of this has shattered the confidence of many of my growers and forced far too many of them onto some form of government handout to survive. To make matters worse, the confidence of the financial market has been substantially eroded, so that those who are keen to install state-of-the-art irrigation or new trellising to take advantage of new technology, particularly in viticulture, are denied access to capital because of the lack of confidence in the financing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I commend the government for bringing this legislation forward, I want to warn that growers, particularly citrus growers, are hard-pressed to have any money to pay levies at all, but I have the confidence that they will continue to do that as they have for some substantial time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what can be done to assist horticulture? Let us make a genuine bipartisan contribution to assist horticulture, which has the potential to emerge as an important export earner for this nation. Most forms of horticultural production in Australia have a high labour intensity, much higher than in broadacre agriculture. By way of example, as a proportion of farm costs, labour costs on average in the wine grape industry are 56 per cent, in citrus 47 per cent, and in canning fruit 51 per cent; as against broadacre primary commodities like wheat at 22 per cent and wool at 25 per cent. Unfortunately, in Australia the cost of our labour is inordinately high. Efforts are being made to reduce the dependency on labour, but it must be remembered that it will always be a high labour industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to add to the member for Gwydir's comments about the attitude adopted with respect to the taxation treatment of capital expenditure. Access to capital is one problem, but the taxation treatment of expenditure on new horticultural plantations still remains a vital issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current treatment of expenditure for the establishment of horticultural plantations distorts investment decisions by growers and disadvantages horticulture, which is based on a perennial crop, as against annual crops. Depreciation is allowed for plant and equipment, but trees are not regarded as such. Costs associated with establishment are deemed to be of a capital nature and as such are not tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A significant number of stone fruit growers in the Woorinen and Tresco areas of my electorate have adopted state-of-the-art technology in respect of the varieties they plant and state-of-the-art grading with computer aided facilities. They are very well advanced in their attitude towards their future. However, some of the varieties they are planting only survive three or four years. Because of the idiosyncrasies of the market, a new variety is then sought and so the growers are required to plant a new variety within a short space of time. So the approach of regarding the tree as a capital item is not going to continue, because within a few years it could be removed and a new variety replace it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Gwydir has, I urge the government to give the matter much fairer consideration. I ask it to remove the current anomalies, which are recognised by the Industry Commission and, to some extent, were recognised by the government in the last deal it made with the wine industry. Because of the need to get the wine tax increases through the House urgently, the government made some moves towards addressing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me compare the tax treatment of fruit producers with some of our competitor nations. For example, in the United States of America, fruit producers are allowed a 10 per cent depreciation, on a straight line basis, for trees and vines. Indeed, 10 per cent depreciation is also permitted in New Zealand, although it is on a diminishing value formula. So the different tax treatments in our competing countries are reducing the international competitiveness of horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition often addresses the issue of transport costs. Transport is a major factor in the cost of production and supply of horticultural products, both domestically and internationally. Most horticultural products are moved in Australia by road, and all levels of government need to press on with the reforming of Australia's domestic shipping, rail and air transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that relatively small volumes are involved and that reduces the access to bulk carriers that are available for the wheat industry and the oil and gas industries. Apart from dried vine fruit, it is very difficult to fill a ship entirely with one of the horticultural commodities. As well, these commodities are of a sensitive nature and it is necessary to get them to the market as quickly as possible to take advantage of the small window of opportunity that the honourable member for Gwydir has referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I refer to the issue brought to the attention of this chamber by the honourable member for Gwydir regarding the citrus industry's urgent need to have other than concentrate fruit juices exempt from sales tax. It has already been stated that as of 1 January 1995 the previous concession for 25 per cent local content is going to be removed, and, in a disgruntled way, the industry has accepted that. It has realised the reality of the GATT requirements and Australia's urgent need to convince the world that it is prepared to do the right thing. But it seems to me that there is an enormous anomaly in imposing sales tax on fresh orange juice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could adopt a GATT friendly procedure that would not preclude any country in the world from exporting fresh juice to this country. They will have a lot more difficulty in achieving that, of course. But there is an anomaly when whole milk and tea and coffee and whole fresh oranges do not incur a tax but orange juice does. The citrus industry will gain the capacity for further growth in the important `not from concentrate'&mdash;fresh&mdash;segment of the orange juice market. The industry, through its own initiative, has taken a determined direction to overcome the pressures it is facing with cost push and commodity difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government ought to look seriously at this issue. It has been considering it for a reasonable time and my citrus growers are waiting anxiously for a decision. A sales tax exemption for 100 per cent `not from concentrate' fruit juices is an opportunity for the government to remove the local content rule without crippling the industry. As I have said, the citrus industry has suffered enough. It is an opportunity for the government to avoid even further damages to fragile regional economies and it will give an unbelievable fillip to an industry that is flagging in its confidence. I think that the adjustment can certainly be made in a revenue neutral way. I would urge government representatives who are still present in this chamber to urge the minister to support this initiative and give my citrus growers the badly needed fillip that they are waiting for. </PARA>

In doing so, I address my remarks basically to the horticultural industry and mainly to the area of exports and export performance. Australia's export performance in recent years has grown in certain areas, but growth overall has been small compared with our Southern Hemisphere competitors. A gradual reduction of tariffs on many horticultural products, and the requirement that quarantine barriers to further domestic access are satisfied, means that our domestic producers will face increasing competition from horticultural imports. It is a fact of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current planning trends and forecast production increases, both in Australia and overseas, indicate that Australian horticultural industries will need to concentrate on developing and maintaining export markets. There is also scope for regaining domestic market share and developing competitive import replacement industries, particularly processed products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enhanced export efforts will only be successful if the fragmented nature of the industry is re-shaped into a modern, dynamic, international industry. The opportunities developing, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, will only be available for a relatively short period before the distribution systems are taken up by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian exports of fresh and processed horticultural products are likely to increase three-fold in value to approximately $2 billion by the year 2000. An important development in the trade will be the role played by large, well financed, vertically integrated businesses exporting on a significant scale. The major destination for Australian horticultural produce will be the markets of northern Asia, South-East Asia and the Pacific countries. Smaller inroads will continue to be made into opportunities in niche markets in Europe and North America. We have an example of that in Gippsland at the present time where a large multinational company closed down an operation in East Gippsland. The farmers rallied and resurrected the company. It is now known as Vegro and it exports its products to France. The owners have gone from an impossible position two years ago to a very positive position today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased volume of exports will be made in refrigerated ships with produce packed in modified atmosphere packaging. This will produce an alternative to air freight and increase the competitiveness of produce. I do not know how many people realise it, but ANL has played a major role in the development of this atmospheric packaging in order to get our products to these niche markets. Part of the plea I would make to those who now have the responsibility for ANL, looking at what needs to be maintained and what needs to be chopped off, is that they do not throw out the baby with the bathwater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any industry that is developing a niche market, with the potential to grow, there is always going to be that problem of in between&mdash;where you cannot charter a full ship. You need to do specific work in order to develop your industry. ANL has played a major role in that area and we should not lose that. It could be to the detriment of our industry if we cannot make that jump to the levels required to go out and charter full ships and not get caught in the middle. We need to always bear that in mind when people are talking about what they are going to do with ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gross value of production of the horticultural sector will need to increase to approximately $5 billion by the year 2000 in order to service increased domestic consumption and increased exports of fresh and processed horticultural products. Research and development will be critical in providing new varieties suited to our growing areas. Also required are more efficient growing practices and substantial reductions in chemical use through the adoption of integrated pest management techniques. The demand for new varieties and exotics is likely to increase as consumers become more affluent. Australia is in a position to exploit these opportunities by developing new varieties and identifying niche markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that right now in the main parliamentary chamber we are debating the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, which is another crucial piece of legislation which was introduced by this government and is now being amended. That bill will have an enormous impact on the horticultural industry. Further, the demand for convenience foods is likely to increase, thus providing Australian horticulture with the opportunity to add value to its products and take advantage of new markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major issues have been identified. The Australian horticultural industry has been protected thus far by tariffs and quarantine regulations. It has also been supported by statutory marketing authorities and subsidised by government contributions to irrigation infrastructure. This assistance is progressively being removed, with the result that horticultural producers must now become internationally competitive in order to survive. These changes should be seen as challenges that will ultimately foster a stronger, more efficient export oriented horticultural industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural task force, which has been mentioned by others, was established by the Commonwealth government and chaired by Senator Sherry, and it identified six major issues specific to horticulture which represent impediments to the development of competitive horticultural industries. These impediments need to be overcome if Australia is to become a major exporter of horticultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six issues are: the need for a substantially improved export marketing effort, including continued efforts to improve access to key Asian markets; reform of the activities of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service; the need for increased research and development, in which this legislation will be of assistance; improved access to capital; the need for greater leadership in horticulture; and reduction in production and distribution costs. That is a tall order, but one that we can certainly achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, it is important for the Australian horticultural industry to develop an export ethic and to benchmark itself against overseas industries. There is a need for consistent quality, greater value adding and more innovative presentation of fresh and processed products. There is also a need for an improved organisational structure for export marketing in order to promote activities such as charter shipping, controlled distribution of long lines of brand identified quality product, and coordinated marketing. Increased efforts are also required in overcoming barriers to international market access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth, in this legislation, is matching industry funding for research and development through the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The HRDC needs to develop a clear strategy and increased adoption and commercialisation of horticultural research findings. There is also a need for an increased commitment to funding research and development to overcome quarantine barriers and provide an expansion of market access for Australian products. Austrade is playing a crucial role in assisting industry with exports in a range of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improved access to capital from the financial institutions is a key issue. It is required by the horticultural sector. The capital invested in land needs to be freed by the removal of restrictions on land transfer and through positive encouragement to more farm build-up. We have seen it occurring, but it must continue. There is a need for improved leadership in horticulture through the development of nationally representative peak industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">High material costs for Australian horticulture are an issue. The ability to compete on a cost basis in export industries is obviously a factor of major importance, while there is also a need for industry to continually seek lower import costs and increased production efficiency. The honourable member for Gwydir mentioned the increase in diesel costs. To hear him talk, you would think the farmers were paying increased levies on diesel. That is not the case. The producers in agriculture in this country do not pay the excise, and they get enormous assistance in that regard. They may have a cost burden from any increases in diesel prices if they are shipping their stuff by road to the exporters, but the importers also pay equal costs, so there is no real competitive advantage imposed by that policy position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural industry is, I am pleased to say, analysing its current position in regard to each of the key issues: the future vision, the impediments to the achievement of the vision, and the most appropriate strategies required to address and overcome the impediments. All horticulturists need to look outwards and learn from those producers who are currently exporting successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my previous experience in the 1980s in this parliament, chairing the primary industry committee, I had a hands-on approach to many of those issues of restructuring that were going on at that stage. The industry that I can talk about with the greatest depth is the dairying industry, which is important in the Gippsland region. That was an industry that also needed to look outward, and one that also needed to develop a real export orientation and a production approach to its products; and it did so. There was a lot of opposition to those changes&mdash;in fact, there was some violent opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recounted to the parliament before now the story of a large meeting I attended with John Kerin in my electorate. Some 1,500 farmers turned up, and they were not even a little bit happy about the proposals we were putting to the diary industry. At the time, they saw it as selling them out, but we stood our ground. I must admit that John Kerin's car got a fair hammering when he was trying to get out from the meeting, but we stood our ground and the dairy industry did restructure. Today it is miles ahead of the horticultural industry because of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The embarrassment of that was that we tried to do the same thing in the area represented by the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). The member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), then the leader of the NFF, was a person who could see what was required to be done, but I am afraid the National Party elements at the time were exploiting the situation for political purposes and did not put their constituents ahead of their own political aspirations. Instead of supporting the changes at the time, they violently opposed them, as some did in the dairy industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not get the support that was required, and neither did the honourable member for Barker, the present opposition spokesman on the environment; and here we are today, eight years further down the track, still talking about the same issues. I think it is time that the members of the opposition right across the board, and not just those who know these issues from their own electorates, started to realise that there are times when one leads from the front. One does not stand at the back and make lots of noises for the benefit of politicians, to the detriment of one's own constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural industry does need to look outwards. It is moving&mdash;it is certainly moving&mdash;now. An example would be that in those days I was talking about we were still producing juices with costs of $40 versus $150. The product that we are trying to produce cannot compete, yet because of our location in the Southern Hemisphere versus the Northern Hemisphere we have the opportunity to supply the Californian market. We have oranges in the Californian off-season, but we have done very little about it and we need to get our act together in that regard. I am sure that if the industry does get into this mode and does get into this operation it can look forward to an enormous future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk a little about the Asian situation. Asia is an enormous market. There are enormous prospects there. By the year 2000, for example, 220 million Asian consumers will be earning over $US10,000 a year. Even in developing countries such as Indonesia, from five to 10 per cent of the population will be in the middle to high income brackets and will have ample money to spend on high value foods. With a population of over 190 million in that country, that means a market of some 10 million to 20 million people, and it is growing at a rapid rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to take our head out of the mallee sand and look to the future, to listen to those in the industry who really are moving in the right direction and are moving their industry on. In my opinion they are moving eight years later than they could have done, but I am very positive about the moves that this government is making now, with the recommendations of the Sherry task force. That task force put very strong recommendations to the government. The industry itself now has to come forward and put the positives forward. It has to do what the dairy industry did. If it delivers the message to its own constituency it will see that it has a great future. I strongly support the legislation. </PARA>

In standing to speak on it, I must declare something of a vested interest, having spent most of my life in the horticultural industry and still having a very small, but nonetheless real, involvement in it. As previous speakers have said, this bill allows an expansion to the present act that permits the collection of levies for horticulture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These levies are collected on a dollar for dollar basis, so industry money is matched by the government, and that money can then be used for research and development in the industry; or, where it is appropriate, where the industry is aligned with the horticultural corporation, it can be used for promotion. There has been bipartisan support for these bills and for the changes that this particular bill allows to the collection of levies for horticultural purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As previous speakers have also said, levies are already collected on horticultural products in a variety of ways. Some are collected on a per tonne basis. Clearly, it is impractical to collect levies, for example, where fruit is being used in a processing role and is measured and paid for on a tonnage basis; so the levy is consigned on a tonnage basis. Where it is marketed in a case or a carton, it may be on a per carton basis. Where it is marketed, as is particularly sensitive and perishable fruit, in a tray, then it may be on a tray basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that we are currently considering&mdash;and, as a government and opposition, are supporting&mdash;are changes that are being requested by the nashi industry, because the nashi industry clearly seeks more flexibility than the present act gives it, if nashi growers are to have a nashi levy collected in an equitable way. This proposal is that, in the case of the nashi industry, it should be possible for a levy to be based on the number of, or the area of, nashi trees held under cultivation by a grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that another area of change being considered as part of the legislation, to accommodate the strawberry industry, was to allow for a levy to be placed on strawberry runners at the point of collection, so that growers could use that as a means of assessing their involvement in the industry and the appropriate level of levy contribution they should make. As the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) has said, we actually have an instance already where some nursery products collect a levy on the basis of the plastic pot. Now one may ask, `What has a plastic pot got to do with the plant?', but the plastic pot is unique to the nursery industry, and so the number of plastic pots collected proves to be an equitable way in which to measure a grower's involvement and production in a particular industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the chamber simply allows the collection of a horticultural levy to be more flexibly based. In that sense, it has the support of not only the government and the opposition but also of the horticultural industries that have sought this sort of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) has already made the point, and in fact it has been agreed by other members in this Main Committee chamber, that the collection of a levy for horticultural products is important because the horticultural industry offers such a great deal of export potential. It is unique that we have an industry that is as competitive as the horticultural industry is, when it is in fact also characterised by the level of labour intensity that is involved with horticultural production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, the viticultural industry&mdash;which is in itself labour intensive, with all of the mechanisation that is now part of the growing exercise&mdash;has been characterised by its capacity to be value adding and labour intensive. It has led the way in export development and given an opportunity for other horticultural products to say, `This is what we believe we ought to be doing.' As the honourable member for Gwydir said in his contribution to this debate, there is right now for horticulture a narrow window of opportunity to expand into export markets, and it is into those export markets that horticulture is endeavouring to hurry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition can claim some credit for the government's initiative in promoting a horticultural task force. I was one who, because of my distinct interest in horticulture, was anxious to persuade the opposition leader of the time to consider the introduction of an opposition horticultural task force; and the present honourable member for Mallee was conscious of that, because he was also contesting an election at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was as a result of that opposition initiative that, I notice, the government responded with a government horticultural task force specifically charged with addressing the difficulties that were being posed at that stage by the citrus industry and by other horticultural industries. As a result of that government task force, we had some recommendations&mdash;some good and some bad&mdash;for the vineyard industry, and a number of recommendations that quite explicitly applied to the citrus industry and to the areas represented by the honourable member for Mallee and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This point ought to be taken up in the comments that the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) made about the so-called Kerin dairy plan. It is significant to note that, in the area of GATT legislation, we had an instance where the opposition was supportive of the government in promoting something that was unpopular. I felt that the honourable member for McMillan could have been a shade more charitable. He was critical of some of the things that happened in the run-up to the dairy industry, but the majority of people in the opposition coalition recognised what the Kerin plan had to achieve, and they endeavoured to make it happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the GATT reforms that have been so important to this government, it would have been much easier for the honourable member for Mallee and me to have simply been blindly in opposition to those reforms. We would currently be lauded as heroes in our electorates. The reality is that the government has had from the opposition a great deal of support in the necessary GATT reforms that it has pursued. It has been commended for those reforms, and it ill behoves either the honourable member for McMillan or, for that matter, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to not acknowledge the degree to which the opposition has forgone electoral popularity in order to do what it believed was in the nation's&mdash;and by implication, in this case, the government's&mdash;long-term best interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Furthermore, no industry was as sensitive to the changes that the government proposed under GATT, or as bruised by them, as were the horticultural industries and, in the case of the honourable member for Mallee and me, the citrus industry. The citrus industry is still unconvinced of the advantages that GATT has offered it, but the simple reality is that for primary industry in Australia GATT has been a plus, and it can be a real plus for the citrus industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the lowering of tariff barriers has made it more difficult for one of Australia's key horticultural industries, the citrus industry, to stay in production, particularly in the production of concentrated juice. But this Main Committee, the honourable member for McMillan and the government all need to be aware of the fact that the citrus industry has not neglected the opportunity for export promotion that the GATT negotiations have given us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can proudly claim&mdash;and the honourable member for Mallee can endorse this, since the Mildura producers in his area have been very much a part of this, along with my producers&mdash;that we are getting into the American market for oranges. This Main Committee and the House ought to be aware of the fact that, while we stand here, there are ships steaming to America&mdash;four of them, in fact, on the water&mdash;loaded with Riverland and Sunraysia navel oranges, heading into the heart of citrus production in the world: into the American and, principally, the New York market&mdash;into direct competition with Californian producers. That is happening right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had been having this debate two or three weeks ago, we would have been having it at the time when the first of those ships had arrived had been unpacked. The Americans and the American horticultural industry had changed the rules while those ships were on the water. The original agreement had been that the citrus&mdash;and we are now talking about whole fruit in cartons&mdash;could be unpacked, and that a mould tolerance of five per cent would be acceptable. After all, that is the norm around the world. That had been the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These citrus fruits were unpacked, and the Americans said, `We are now going to apply a mould tolerance of 0.5 per cent. Sorry: typo error. This is what we really meant.' The fact that that sort of proposal was in place instantly meant that my growers and those of the honourable member for Mallee were about to face a repacking charge&mdash;with all of those cartons rolled over rollers and repacked&mdash;of $2 million for those four vessels on the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Americans backed down, thanks to the action of the government and of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins; and thanks, if I might immodestly say so, to the actions of the honourable member for Mallee and of the member for Wakefield, who both supported the government in this instance; and thanks to the citrus industry organisations and to Mr David Cain, who is the General Secretary of the Citrus Board of South Australia, and who flew to America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a good indication of what GATT has allowed Australians to do for the first time. The Americans faced the grim reality that, if they stayed on the course they were on and changed the rules, we could do the same thing when they sought to bring Californian navels into Australia. While they might well have scorned that, they also had to face the other reality that when they sat around a table called GATT with all the other GATT signatories they would be seen no longer to have played the game. So they acquiesced and those exports are going ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit unfair for the honourable member for McMillan not to acknowledge the active participation of the citrus industry in that export market right now. However, it is quite fair for him to comment that there is need for additional leadership, additional entrepreneurial skill and additional innovation in the citrus industry. The government can help cultivate that, not only with the passage of this legislation but also with putting in place some of those recommendations that its own Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, has put his name to in the government's horticultural task force report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of what the horticultural task force proposed has been picked up appropriately by the member for Mallee. I endorse his comment that we would seek from the government some commitment to ensure that the planting tax write-off that the government introduced for viticulture, 12 months ago or less, also applies to horticulture. With real passion I say to the government members opposite that it ought to apply because otherwise wrong signals are being sent into the areas we represent. The signals going right now into the Riverland and Sunraysia are, `Let's plant grapes because there is a tax write-off for doing so.' That is currently to the disadvantage not only of the citrus industry but also of the stone fruit industry and the dried tree fruit industry. Frankly, I think we should be sending a signal that says, `Let's expand our potential horticultural export production by offering the same tax write-off for trees as we do for vines.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is dangerous for the government to nominate a success story, such as that of the wine industry, and to put too much emphasis on it. It is complicated by the fact that we are then saying to a dried fruit grower, `You ought to be putting in dried vine fruits because of the tax write-off and not dried tree fruits where there is not a tax write-off.' I believe that issue ought to be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that ought to be pursued diligently by the government&mdash;it has already been picked up by the honourable member for Mallee&mdash;is what we do about the current tax as it applies to citrus juice in Australia. The point has been made that, in the case of the dairy industry, whole milk can be produced in Australia under the present tax regime and no tax applies because fresh milk is regarded as a food product. As the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) would be aware because he has a number of dairies in his area, there are no dairymen who would suggest that we ought to be putting a tax on whole milk either. It ought to continue to be regarded as a whole food product. I ask the government&mdash;I have asked this question before and I ask it again now&mdash;what the difference is between squeezing juice out of an orange and squeezing milk out of an udder. In either instance a whole food product is being produced and the tax applying to it ought consistently to be zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current arrangement that the citrus industry faces is that the government has generously agreed that wherever the citrus industry puts 25 per cent Australian product into its juice, as opposed to Brazilian concentrate or any other form, then that ought to get a tax differential so it is only taxed at 11 per cent instead of at 21 per cent. That distinctly has been an advantage to the Australian industry. Obviously, it is GATT illegal, because it is something that exclusively advantages the Australian industry to the disadvantage of any one of our competitors. If you take that away you put the Australian citrus juice industry at risk. The dairy industry has been debating over the last few weeks what it does with the way in which levies are applied to the dairy industry, and it has come up with a GATT-friendly way of solving its problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is saying to the government, `You ought urgently and seriously to consider what the citrus industry is saying.' The citrus industry has put to the government a proposal that says, `We can no longer accept a tax differential for 25 per cent Australian product because it is GATT unfriendly.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of that, let us have a situation where juice squeezed out of an orange, like juice squeezed out of an udder, is tax free, and all other juice is taxed at 21 per cent. There is nothing GATT unfriendly about that. Anyone who wants to bring fresh juice into Australia&mdash;that is, juice not made from concentrate&mdash;will bring it in here and have it tax exempt; but anyone who is producing any other product and bringing it in&mdash;juice from concentrate, for example&mdash;will recognise that it has a tax burden of 21 per cent. This is the proposal being put by the largest processor in Australia, Berrivale Orchards at Berri. It was originally a grower owned cooperative, but it has now been modified and that is not exclusively true. It is saying to the government, `Let us amend the tax so that we favour not Australian product, but fresh product&mdash;consistent with what you currently do for the diary industry&mdash;and put all other product at 21 per cent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why the government should be hesitating about this, but I am not in government so I am not about to pass instant judgment on that. My point is that a decision is urgent; because, as everyone will appreciate, all processors right now are saying to themselves that it is obvious the 25 per cent advantage is about to go, and maybe it will be replaced with nothing, so they are not about to buy any oranges as if there is going to be a continuing 25 per cent advantage on Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are presuming that there will be no particular advantage in using Australian product; and as a result, as the member for Mallee has said, we currently have a situation where growers producing export whole fruit for the Californian market are getting a good price on the Californian market but are getting nothing for their juice overrun. They get nothing for their juice overrun because no-one wants to buy it, because people think they will be able to get it more cheaply because the present regime is not going to continue. That is a disaster. Why bother to grow oranges at all for a potential export market when half of them are going to disappear for nothing and when, as the member for Mallee has said, what you get for the juice will not only be less than the cost of production, but less than the cost of picking the fruit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal is simply this: growers recognise, reluctantly, that GATT may not have been to their disadvantage and that the government and the opposition may have been right in standing up as they did for the GATT changes; and they now recognise that GATT will mean that they can no longer continue with the advantageous situation they have had in the past. They are saying, `Let us change it. Let us accept that whole fruit fresh product is a food and should be tax exempt, and that all other processors ought to be taxed at 21 per cent. We are then putting to the government a proposal that will cost them nothing in revenue terms and will ensure that the export potential of the citrus industry can continue to be realised.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Chairman, I noticed that the honourable member for McMillan concluded by making a comment or two about what he saw as the inconsistency of the honourable member for Gwydir in referring to the diesel rebate. I only want to remind the member for McMillan that the member for Gwydir's reference was simply to the fact that all rural costs go up because of the greater dependence that rural people have on fuel. The member for Gwydir, as a farmer, knows that the on-cost of diesel is rebatable to him, but that does not alter the fact that his shearer&mdash;or anyone else working in any one of the towns he represents&mdash;has an additional cost for his motor vehicle every time the cost of fuel goes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for McMillan said in his concluding remarks that horticulture was moving. I quote: `Horticulture is moving&mdash;it is certainly moving&mdash;now'. He was, of course, right. It is almost September and there is not a horticultural crop that is not about to burst into bloom. In that sense, horticulture is certainly moving; and if in fact this legislation does what the government hopes, then this may well be the spring for horticulture in Australia. </PARA>

I had a certain objection to this room when it was first proposed, but having come here for the first time I think that perhaps the exchange of ideas and debate might be better here than it is downstairs. It strikes me that that may be possible. So for all my doubts, it might work in the end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me commend the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on his obvious knowledge of and concern for the horticultural industry in particular, but also generally for all agricultural industries. It is a concern that we all are very focused on at the present time with the dreadful drought that has beset much of Australia. I know that my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) is also deeply concerned about the plight of many country people due to the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am here to support the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994 and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994. I am pleased, because this presentation of this series of bills was prompted by sections of the horticultural industry. The purpose of the bills is to improve the flexibility of the collection of levies and charges on the horticultural industry and to improve their fairness and their equity. I think those three terms&mdash;flexibility, equity and fairness&mdash;reflect areas in which this government has a fine record and it is continuing to strive towards those aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of these bills will allow an expanding horticultural industry to broaden the basis for levy collection on horticultural products. It will allow individual sectors of the horticultural industry the right to impose levies appropriate to their needs. The three bills are drafted separately because of constitutional requirements to isolate legislation which involves charges from those which involve levies. The bills should, however, be considered together as part of this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), in his second reading speech, indicated that the bills will amend the Horticultural Export Charge Act 1987 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to enable levies to be collected on the basis of the area under cultivation or other horticultural inputs to the production process, such as the number of trees, shrubs, plants, bulbs or tubers which are under cultivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for the levy to be imposed in this way, it will be necessary for a presumed yield from those horticultural inputs to be specified in the regulations. It seems particularly correct to me that the horticultural industry has come to the government with these proposals. The government&mdash;and in particular the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry&mdash;has been a vocal advocate of the industry attempts to restructure itself in order to take advantage of significant market opportunities, both domestically and internationally, that are around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some involvement in helping the leaders of the industry in that respect. I released the Horticultural Policy Council's report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning the race: international competitiveness in Australian horticulture</EMPHASIS> at the Qantas cargo centre at Mascot airport some months ago. That report reinforced much of the content and findings of the horticultural task force which was led by Senator Sherry. Both of the reports identified huge market opportunities for export, particularly in the Asian region, but sounded warnings that Australian producers and the rest of the community would miss out on the benefits of those opportunities if the industry failed to restructure and become aggressive and internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember being asked by a journalist after releasing that report, `Have we missed the bus?' and I said, `We have not missed the bus, but we are certainly not on the gravy train.' So there is a lot of work still to be done to become internationally competitive. The move towards international competitiveness, largely from the nashi fruit industry, and that is also likely to be followed by strawberry producers and others, signifies to me that the industry has heeded and is heeding the call and is starting to examine closely how it can reach its full potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is only an initial, small step and the others that are likely to follow could be more difficult, but it is a positive start. I would like to assure the industry representatives that proposals to improve their international competitiveness will be considered very favourably by this government. I would expect that such moves would gain bipartisan support, as has this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Horticultural Policy Council document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning the race</EMPHASIS>, the massive potential for this industry is abundantly clear. It is estimated that horticultural exports have the potential to reach the value of $2 billion by the end of the decade. You cannot underestimate the impediments and the hurdles to be crossed in order to achieve that target, but the potential has been set and it is up to all those involved in the industry and in the government to do everything they can to ensure that that target is reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The myth of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s that things in Australia would continue to improve without any real effort is dying&mdash;people no longer think that way. Effort, investment, dedication, leadership and knowledge are needed. The domestic market itself will become ever more subject to international competition and, even to survive here, industry needs to take on the rest of the world in both price and quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Horticulture is Australia's second largest agricultural sector, with a gross value of production in 1991-92 at $644 million. It is second only to the beef industry and, surprising to many, ahead of grains and wool. While the export performance of certain sectors of the industry has improved in recent years, exporters have faced increased competition, particularly from southern exporters, such as Chile, South Africa and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, fresh and processed horticultural exports comprised: fresh fruit, $208 million; fresh vegetables, $114 million; processed fruit, $140 million; processed vegetables, $25 million; nursery products, $27 million; dried grapes, $83 million; nuts, $20 million; and other, $27 million. The major commodities of the Australian horticultural industry are, of course, fruits, nuts, vegetables, nursery products, cut flowers and also cultivated turf. The majority of the fresh produce is exported to Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia, while processed fruit and dried fruit are destined predominantly for Europe, Canada and Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is self-sufficient in horticultural produce. Fruit and vegetables are mostly grown for sale as fresh produce on the domestic market or directed to processing. Some 80,000 growers are currently engaged in horticultural production, with a further 11,500 employed in fruit and vegetable processing. Australian shoppers spend $1.25 billion on fruit and vegetables in supermarkets a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is clear that the industry is a major contributor to the Australian economy and to employment. It is also clear that efficiency improvements will improve the industry's export performance and bring benefits to Australian consumers. The benefits of an efficient industry are clear. The entire government and opposition should applaud the efforts of the industry in bringing these proposals to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that the Australian horticultural industry has been focused on the domestic market for far too long and has taken very little interest in the world market. At the same time, the industries in other countries have been adapting and improving their international competitiveness at a faster rate than we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear message in the horticultural report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning the race</EMPHASIS>, is that the Australian horticultural industry needs to address a number of issues in its quest to increase its competitiveness on world markets. We need to develop an export culture and coordinate our marketing activities in order to meet importers' demands for large quantities of consistent product. We need to bear in mind that our international competitors are characterised by large, vertically integrated companies and single-desk marketing authorities. We need to focus on the Asian region, where export prospects are greatest. We need to strive for consistent quality, greater value adding and innovative presentation of fresh and processed products. We need to look at our industry practices and benchmark them against our overseas competitors. We need to adopt more cost-effective methods, such as coordinating our export shipments with other Australian suppliers and making more use of charter services. We need to focus on the requirements of importers and develop high quality products and marketing strategies to meet those needs. We need to promote the advantage that Australian produce has over many of our competitors, capitalising on our clean and green image as a producer of wholesome food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australian horticultural industries do not meet the challenge to make the changes and increase competitiveness, they will continue to lose market share, not just in export markets but also on the domestic market. In other words, it is the next few years which will show whether we miss the bus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of this there is an obvious role for government, starting with the bills before us here this morning. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning the race</EMPHASIS> the Horticultural Policy Council has set out a number of areas where domestic and international competitiveness can be improved through the activities of government. In section 3.11.1, on `Government Regulations and Charges: the Australian Perspective', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of government regulations and charges which impact on the development of horticultural exports and reduce our international competitiveness. The main charges are AQIS export inspection, levies payable to statutory marketing and R&amp;D authorities, payroll taxes, workers compensation, superannuation, training guarantee levy, road transport, customs and port charges.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of these have been addressed or are in the process of being addressed by the government. Last year's budget announced significant changes to the operation of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, where the benefits will flow through to all exporters of Australian primary produce. The levies payable to statutory marketing and research and development authorities are being addressed to some extent here this morning. Payroll taxes, of course, are a matter for the state governments. The training guarantee levy has been abolished. We are also addressing the road transport charges by making our road and</PARA>
<PARA>rail networks more efficient and appropriate to the needs of industry and continually improving the efficiency of our ports. It could hardly be said that we are sitting on our hands or that we are not responsive to the needs of industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that competition should be introduced into export inspection by allowing appropriately experienced private companies to provide export inspection services. Though the terminology may vary, this is being done through quality assurance programs run and administered by the industries where they have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quality assurance is an area to which the industry needs to devote significantly more attention, and I hope that the research and development initiatives which these bills will promote will help to achieve that end. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning the race</EMPHASIS> says that the Australian growers are primarily supply driven and on the whole are domestically oriented in their attitudes to production and product quality standards. In the past these attitudes have caused significant problems with horticultural export outcomes, with the result that Australian horticultural products generally have a less than satisfactory reputation for quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area where it will be difficult to convince overseas buyers that there have been significant developments. Once a bad reputation has been gained it is difficult to shake, but improvement has been achieved in a variety of other industries and there is no reason why it cannot occur in horticulture generally. We need to convince our overseas buyers that there has been a massive attitudinal change in our horticultural industries and that this change of attitude has been reflected in the quality of the products that we make available for export. All groups in the Australian horticultural industry need to be convinced that it is worth doing and then they need to tackle it head-on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date there has been some resistance from certain sections of the industry to that sort of approach, and I hope that will change. The culture within the entire Australian community has changed over the past decade. There is a growing recognition in the Australian work force that quality is paramount, that the jobs of workers depend on it and that the profitability of Australian companies also depends on it. In horticulture the traditions of the farming community die hard, but the attitude towards quality is changing and accelerating. With enthusiasm and leadership from particularly the leaders of the industry, it will not be long before virtually all sectors of the industry are committed to quality assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though identified as cost factors affecting international competitiveness in the industry, quality research and development are important keys to success. Developing new products, researching market opportunities, providing those markets with products they want, not simply what is available, are important keys to unlocking the success of Australian horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the opposition scaremongering that we seem to get at budget time each year, the government's commitment to match industry research funds&mdash;dollar for dollar, up to the half a per cent of an industry's gross value of production&mdash;remains firm. This is an important initiative and one which industry leaders should pursue more actively. I hope, and I am reasonably confident, that the new structures for levies and charges that we are discussing here today will encourage those industry leaders to do just that. I am confident, too, that these measures will lead to a more equitable arrangement for the collection of levies and charges so that those who benefit from the development of new products and markets pay their fair share of the research dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, I believe many in the industry have been able to shirk their responsibilities but have reaped the benefits of the payments of others. That is clearly unfair and does need to be addressed. This package of legislation does not impose the solution of non-payers on industry leaders but offers them the choice of making some alternative arrangements so that they may force those people to cough up the dough. The bills will achieve much more than this but, even if they did not, this would be a worthwhile outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, my interest in this topic is due to the industry in my region and it is not merely academic. It has got a direct impact on the well-being of many of my constituents. On the New South Wales north coast there are 250 avocado growers, growing about $16 million worth of fruit from 1,000 hectares of property. There are 1,200 banana growers, producing 35 per cent of Australia's crop on family farms which cover about 5,200 acres. That is a crop worth $60 million a year. There are 60-odd blueberry growers growing 70 per cent of Australia's crop in an industry worth about $4 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a fledging coffee industry with the potential to produce millions of dollars of income each year. There are more than 100 flower growers in an industry worth $5 million annually. There are 90 kiwi fruit growers, producing over $2 million worth of crop on 150 hectares of vines. There are 500 macadamia nut growers producing about $16 million worth of crop on 4,500 hectares of trees. There are mango growers. There are registered nurseries producing an annual output of up to $140 million a year. There is $3 million worth of passionfruit produced from about 70 growers annually. There is $1.2 million worth of custard apples, $400,000 worth of grapes, $340,000 worth of guava, $400,000 worth of lychees, $6 million worth of stone fruit and $20 million worth of vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, for the north coast, there are about 3,500 growers producing about $300 million a year. We can see how important this industry is, even to one small region of Australia. It is at the crossroads. It needs strong leadership from the people in the industry and it needs encouragement, both from the opposition and the government, in putting in place the framework which it can work properly within. I think the next five years will tell the story of horticulture: whether it is able, as we have seen perhaps in the wine industry, through leadership and aggressive marketing, to break into those markets and to get as much a share or more of that $2 billion potential in Asia as possible.

If we asked an average person what the north coast of New South Wales is famous for, he or she would probably say the beaches and tourism, both of which are indeed very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Page, in his very useful contribution this morning, give some indication of the enormous diversity of the region. He was talking about $300 million worth of export potential in the horticultural area. That brings me to the reason that I am participating in the debate. I represent an area in the central western part of New South Wales including the city of Orange, which coincidentally happens to be the largest apple growing district in Australia. The name of the community and the particular export that is associated with that region are for some people a source of amusement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Horticulture has undergone a great deal of change. It has had great challenges and opportunities open to it in recent years. The honourable member for Page was absolutely right in saying that when we talk about horticulture, as with so many other agricultural industries in this country, it is very easy to think that the good times will roll as they did during the 1950s and 1960s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we forget about the enormous changes that have occurred in the world. No longer are Australian farmers, or the Australian community, owed any special favours by the rest of the world. We are there to compete with major export countries and no-one owes Australia favours. We have to be there with very good products at very competitive prices. This debate has also been useful because of the wide ranging nature of some of the issues that have been canvassed. One of the advantages of a cognate debate such as this, where we are talking about a range of related bills, is that it gives people the opportunity to raise some of these particular concerns. Along with four other members of the powerful and influential Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I had the opportunity to participate in a visit to Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Hollis)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Surely, led it. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct, Mr Deputy Speaker. During that delegation, we had a number of discussions in which we expressed concern about the restrictive practices of the Taiwanese, particularly when it comes to apples. The honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who was the deputy leader on that delegation, certainly echoed the concerns that I had expressed and others in the industry had expressed about some of those restrictive practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tabling our report in the parliament in the last session, we made mention of this particular concern. We noted that Taiwan, in parallel with the People's Republic of China, was seeking to accede to the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, the GATT, and wanted also to be an original member of the World Trade Organisation. We have taken a position as a nation of supporting its application to join GATT provided, of course, that Taiwan brings its policies into conformity with the GATT rules. The particular issue that I mention&mdash;that is, the restriction placed on a range of agricultural items including apple exports to Taiwan&mdash;was discussed by members of the delegation with a number of ministers during our recent visit to Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude of the government there was that Taiwan was very much in the process of opening up its markets, but agriculture posed particular difficulties. During the course of their remarks, the ministers argued that they needed a transition period of up to five years, maybe six years, as it was impossible in their view to abolish existing quota systems overnight. The interesting point was that they said that farmers in Taiwan account for approximately 14 per cent of the population, yet agriculture now accounts for some three per cent of gross national product. They are, however, a very significant force and changes will certainly have to be made incrementally. We hope that those incremental changes will be at a much faster rate than the five- to six-year period that they have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, given some of the structural adjustment that Australian industries have been through in the last few years, what that does is to bring into some sort of focus the fact that we are not alone in having to face up to these particular difficulties of restructuring&mdash;not just in the economy in general, but in agriculture specifically&mdash;and the problems they bring to bear. While it is fair to say that the agricultural sector represents a significant political force in this country, the fact remains that that political force is represented by the largest country party in this parliament. The government party, the Australian Labor Party, represents some 27 of those important regional and rural electorates right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making my comments about the significance of apple growing within the Calare electorate, and with the comments made by the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) about the diversity of horticultural products on the north coast, honourable members can get some sort of indication, by the fact that people like ourselves have been returned to the parliament, that we have some knowledge about the importance of those industries, that we have relationships with the agricultural organisations, the individuals and the farming groups within our respective communities. We like to think, of course, that they would have confidence in our ability to represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that horticultural exports represent an enormous opportunity for export growth. We have talked about figures of upwards of $2 million of exports towards the end of this century. In line with some of the recent reports, like other speakers, I join in commending Senator Nick Sherry, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, on his very valuable work in terms of the horticultural task force report. Those particular recommendations and those issues that have been raised there have been canvassed over wide ranging areas of Australia. I believe that the report enjoys very broad support from people right across the horticultural sector within this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect, not just in relation to horticultural exports, but in relation to foreign exchange earnings generally in this country, is the potential of Asian markets. We all talk rather blithely at times about the significance of the Asia-Pacific region as the fastest growing economic region in the globe at the present time. That is certainly going to continue, but I think we also have to recognise that we have very valuable opportunities in what we see as an emerging and a very significant force, number wise, in what we might broadly call the `middle classing' of many of those Asian nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our important neighbour to the very north of Australia, Indonesia, has a middle-class population equivalent to the total population of Australia. That so-called middle class within Indonesia is expanding quite rapidly. Obviously there is potential in Indonesia in terms of agricultural exports, particularly for fresh food products, from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further north of Indonesia, India&mdash;a country which I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would be well aware of&mdash;has a very significant middle class, in terms of the way in which we would judge that in Australia, with a potential of 80 million to 100 million people. Often we tend to overlook markets like that in terms of opportunity for exports of a range of products from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular bills pick up some of the ideas that have come forward from a range of people within the industry. Hopefully, these bills will allow the potential in horticultural industries to be unlocked, so that there is greater flexibility and opportunities to pursue their needs through their various marketing bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly, as a number of speakers have already commented on to date, there is very strong support for this legislation from a range of particular industries. The amendments that are being made today have been made at the request of the nashi fruit industry, which is proposing to alter its levy arrangements from a levy imposed at the first point of sale to an arrangement whereby levy is collected based on the number or area of nashi trees a grower has under cultivation. This will enable the levy to be collected from the grower based on the presumed level of production of nashi fruit, as stated within the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strawberry industry is another industry that has been specifically cited by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) in his second reading speech. That industry is considering implementing a national levy for research and development payable by the strawberry grower at the point of purchase of strawberry runners, again based on the assumed production of strawberries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to blithely skim over some of these industries. We are obviously aware of the significance of the dried fruit industry, and the importance of the Riverland industries which the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) commented upon. We have heard about some of the niche market fruits that have become very popular in recent times, but it is often overlooked that important fruits, like nashi fruit and strawberries, offer similar potential, and that potential has been recognised by a range of people within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great advantages of this country is its large size&mdash;covering an area of more than seven million square kilometres. It also has a great latitudinal range. Virtually anything can be grown in Australia. As Australia is strategically placed in the vicinity of the fastest growing part of the economic world, over the next few years we will be able to take full advantage of our location. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These particular amendments carry on the process that was begun by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Kerin, in overhauling some of the statutory marketing authorities in the mid-1980s. As the member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) commented, reform had to be undertaken, despite some great controversy and very fierce protest in some industries. I am sure that many of those who were protesting at the time, thinking that their security, lifestyle, and the way in which they had been going about their farming business for years had been threatened by some of these changes, are now very grateful for John Kerin's initiative and leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same leadership has been shown by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, in responding to some of the needs of the industries that are coming forward within this legislation. His response is an indication that this government is well and truly in touch with the needs and aspirations of people in agriculture generally, and in the horticultural sector in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the three pieces of legislation that are part of this cognate debate in the Main Committee today. I know that they will be supported, but, more than that, they will be welcomed, by the industry at large. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was the case for my colleague before me, this is the first occasion I have had to raise a matter in the second chamber. I am pleased to do so and I am sure that I will be in attendance for many debates in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise to support these three bills under the primary industries portfolio, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994, the Hortiultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994. I believe that they have a major significance for the primary industry sector. The Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994 enables a levy to be imposed on the leviable horticultural products or class of products that are presumed to be produced in Australia. The amendments would broaden the base of levy imposed to include presumed production. A new subsection would allow the basis of the levy imposition by imposing a levy on prescribed amounts of leviable horticulture products of a prescribed class that is presumed to be produced in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the amendment is that the existing basis of levy imposition has discouraged additional horticulture industries from becoming levy paying members of the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. Section 7 of the Horticultural Levy Act 1987 refers to the rate of levy being the sum of the rates prescribed by virtue of sections 8, 9 and 10 up to a maximum of five per cent of the average of the gross values of production of the products. The rate would now be set by regulation. This section will operate only if the Australian statistician has published an annual gross value of production in relation to a class of horticultural products for the first three of the four immediately preceding financial years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 5 of the Bill allows for the making of regulations prescribing the way the amount of leviable horticultural products of a prescribed class, presumed to be produced in Australia, is to be determined. This can be done with reference to any one or more of the following: the area under cultivation; the number or quality of trees, shrubs, plants, bulbs, corms or tubers used or to be used; and the maturity of trees, shrubs or plants under cultivation for the above. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill is the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994, which has to be considered with the first bill. Levies and/or charges cannot be consolidated into one act because the laws imposing taxation can deal with only one subject of the taxation or duties of customs or duties of excise only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third bill is the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994. This bill is to assist producers who are exporting horticultural products to not pay a levy if they are already doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed by these three bills would provide the flexibility required for a nashi, which is a sort of pear developed for the Asian market. That industry has requested a new levy to be collected on the basis of the number of nashi trees or areas of production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will also help the strawberry industry, as has been mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) in his second reading speech. That industry is also considering the issue of a national levy for research and development, a levy payable by the strawberry grower at the point of the purchase of the strawberry runners, which is based on a presumed production of strawberries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see from these sorts of clauses that the industry is trying to come to grips with what its needs are and the best way it can collect levies to look at the R&amp;D needs of the horticultural industries in the long term. These levies are compulsory, but they have been requested by the industry in order to ensure research and development does take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before me, my colleague the member for Calare (Mr Simmons) mentioned the work done by Senator Sherry in his role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Senator Sherry is a colleague of mine from Tasmania. His work was well done, and it certainly highlighted the need for more research and development to be done in the horticultural area. It found some big holes, and a need to pull together growers' organisations so that we can get a focus on that and so that government can know who to talk to in some of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has had some excellent outcomes. The spending on horticultural research and development will increase by over $5 million this year, to almost $21.5 million. I think that is only a very small amount of what will need to be done in research and development in this industry in the long term. A program has recently been approved so that the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation will be able to provide support for 397 projects around Australia, worth almost $16 million, with further funding being allocated to support additional important projects throughout the year. So a considerable amount of money is going out there in research, and that will be assisted by these amendments. This growth in expenditure is made possible by an annual growth in levy receipts of 13 per cent in voluntary contributions, to an anticipated $7.7 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It means that the corporation can continue to encourage and assist industries to participate in research and development, which is so important in gaining new markets and developing new products. That is happening in my state of Tasmania constantly these days. New ideas and new products are being developed. It will ensure that Australian horticultural industry is able to function at its full potential, putting money back into the pockets of growers and assisting the overall economic growth of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to see that 32 projects will be funded in Tasmania this year, 1994-95. The value of that funding is $1.2 million. That is a considerable amount of money in the research area. These things are important, because sometimes they need much carryover. When scientists or researchers are working in one particular area they need to have continuity to pursue things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those 32 projects is the commercial crop development of essential oils, which I can remember looking at back in the early 1980s when I was a state member in the Tasmanian parliament. It is going to gain $116,000 to continue an area of research there. This Tasmanian project aims to increase the efficiency, viability and competitiveness of this industry through the development of an extension of sound management practice. This whole industry in essential oils had to develop knowledge on how to gather some of the seeds and some of the buds that were pressed to get the oils. There has been a whole process of management from the picking practices or the extraction from the plants right through to the processing of them. That is a continuation of improving the management practices in that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two potato projects that will be extremely valuable to the industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are well aware that Tasmania grows a lot of apples, a lot of potatoes, and has potential to grow a lot more. There is a lot of work being done to improve the level of potato production within Tasmania and there has been enormous expenditure by some major companies in Tasmania on the potato processing side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the investigations that will be coming up in the R&amp;D this year is the investigation of black dot disease in potatoes and its control. Some $27,000 is going to that. This aims to examine the method of infection by black dot under Tasmanian conditions and to investigate strategies for the control of black dot, which can cause considerable loss in potato production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another investigation which involves potato cultivator assessment and testing involves regional trials of advanced potato selections to assess their performance under Tasmanian conditions for French-fry production. I am told that if we can lift our level of production in Tasmania and get our costs down from that production side, we can match the Americans in the Asian market in the French-fry area. I understand that that would have an enormous value, many millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pyrethrum growers will also benefit by a program to develop fertiliser strategies to maximise production and to improve financial return. That area will receive about $61,000 for research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exciting new industry might be born through the development corporation with a project which will be funded this year to assess the quality of Tasmanian green tea and its potential for the South-East Asian market. I am told that this is a potential 100 to 200 hectares, which is not a lot of ground, and has the potential to become an industry worth about $20 million just to start with. That is a little niche area that I think Tasmania can develop in the future&mdash;as it can improve potato production and become involved in the French-fry production area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate to see the full potato not being sold on the Sydney market, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I am sure that you on many occasions have eaten Tasmanian potatoes. I am sure that they get out into your electorate and I certainly would not like everybody to start eating French-fries and not eat full potatoes. I am sure that that market will continue as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who are paying the levies are going to reap the benefits in the future and their investment in research and development, as we have seen&mdash;with this government's encouragement over the last 10 years, from manufacturing industry right through to now the horticulture area&mdash;does pay off. We must spend dollars in research and development. Twelve to 15 years ago, we as a country were spending very little, not enough. We are now starting to get it right. These bills tack on to that and in the rural area of horticulture we are starting to improve our act. The horticulturalists who are investing in this are investing in their own future and their own success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although these bills are probably not the brightest reading, they mask many varied and exciting projects that are going on all over Australia. They are going to make us more competitive and more successful and with a lot of potential to contribute greatly to our gross national product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pome fruit area in Tasmania will also receive some recognition this year. Some $62,000 will be spent on research in the apple and pear industry; black spot and apple scab will be looked at using environmentally accepted materials instead of chemical spraying. That should cut into the Tasmanian position of trying to sell itself as a clean green producer of many fine foods. I am sure that will be well looked at by the apple and pear growers of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also developing a management strategy for white rot and botryis in onions, which we are going to fund to $178,000. The onion industry in Tasmania has grown enormously and I think we are now probably one of the biggest onion producers and exporters in Australia. I think the New Zealanders are trying to catch up to us. A lot of those onions go into the European market and it has been a very successful operation that has been developed over many years, based on growing the best onion. The two companies that grow these onions on the north-west coast basically set out to achieve world best practice in onion growing and produce the best onion in the world well before we were actually talking about best practices. The project will provide a focus on research and development and extensive activities aimed at achieving a successful disease management strategy for the two diseases that I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of other opportunities. I have just attended a farm search conference which was well supported by this government in the Deloraine area of my electorate. It was run by the Meander Valley enterprise centre, and we heard of many opportunities in the seed production area, in vegetable seed and also in grass seeds. I am sure that industry will grow within that region in future years. There is a concern about the water flows in some areas but I am sure we can improve markedly there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural industry in Tasmania is also increasing enormously in walnut production which has some lead times going out to 10 or 15 years, but there are now a lot of walnut trees. It is an opportunity for many landowners to use some of their land for the production of walnuts. I understand that we sell those walnuts to the Germans, and the Germans are very interested in eating walnuts around Christmas time. It is in their culture to grind up their walnuts and put them into their bread and their biscuits. So utilising someone's culture, being able to produce the right product at the right time in a fresh way, being able to deliver it around their Christmas time, gives us an opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal River Valley group down towards the south is another group that is doing a lot in the area of seed production and also the production of cut flowers and other areas of horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe these bills will add greatly to helping us get the research and development right for this industry. My friend the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) said that five or six years will tell whether the horticultural industry has taken off. I believe it has enormous potential to take off. I believe we can do things well because we are starting to concentrate on research and developing the markets. We need to look at what our markets want to buy and if they want to buy something a bit different from what we grow, then we have got to go out and grow it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I am constantly doing when I am talking to some of the farmers in my electorate is telling them that they might have to start growing things that are not over familiar, even something they have never eaten. Sometimes that gets a bit difficult&mdash;some people are always up against doing something different&mdash;but it is one of things that I think we learnt in Tasmania from the old apple industry. When our apple growers did not convert to some of the new varieties that were needed to go into the Japanese market and into Asia when England abandoned us and went into the EEC, we lost that valuable apple industry&mdash;which is now actually coming back in a different form. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Depending upon the provisions of each treaty, countries (known internationally as "States") may become parties either by signature alone, signature followed by ratification, or accession (the last is a single step, sometimes described as acceptance, approval or adherence).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australia is bound by a treaty, it is obliged under international law to carry out the provisions of that treaty. If Australia consents to be bound by a treaty before the treaty enters into force, it is not bound by the treaty's provisions until general entry into force although from the moment it consents to be bound, Australia is obliged not to do anything to frustrate the object and purpose of the treaty. Similarly, once Australia has signed a treaty, it is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of the treaty, unless and until it decides not to become bound by the treaty and makes known that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Obligations assumed through international treaties, conventions, protocols and other agreements cannot override the Constitution, or the federal system established by the Constitution. Any impact of treaties and other international agreements on the current division of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and the States for particular matters can only occur if the Commonwealth Parliament chooses to assert responsibilities for a matter pursuant to the legislative powers available to it under the Constitution.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The information sought by the honourable member is contained in the 20 June 1994 edition of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publication Insight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) As part of its consideration whether to sign or ratify international treaties, conventions, protocols and other agreements an examination is normally made by the Commonwealth government of the adequacy of existing legislation, whether Federal or State, to enable compliance with the particular obligations. As is recognised in the existing Principles and Procedures for Commonwealth-State Consultation on Treaties, the Commonwealth "will consider relying on State legislation where the treaty affects an area of particular concern to the States and this course is consistent with the national interest and the effective and timely discharge of treaty obligations. However, the Commonwealth does not accept that it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to commit itself in a general way not to legislate in areas that are constitutionally subject to Commonwealth power".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Government regularly consults the States and Territories and interested groups about whether it should become a party to a treaty and on what terms. The States and Territories are advised of treaty negotiations in which Australia is involved every six months via the Commonwealth-State Standing Committee on Treaties. On request, States and Territories are given detailed information on specific matters. However, the Standing Committee, which is essentially a notification mechanism, is not used to conduct Commonwealth&mdash;State/Territory negotiations on specific treaties. Consultations with the States and Territories on specific treaties occurs through a variety of mechanisms&mdash;Ministerial Councils and associated meetings of officials are often used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry groups and other non-governmental organisations are consulted on treaties in which they may have an interest. This consultation provides the opportunity not only for gauging domestic support for specific treaties but also for shaping the Government's approach to particular negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) From time to time, some States (including Australia, the United States and Canada) make unilateral statements about treaties which indicate that their obligations will be implemented in a particular way, in accordance with relevant constitutional arrangements. These statements rarely take the form of a formal reservation, and are usually simply an indication that a sub-federal administration (such as a provincial government) will in fact implement the treaty obligations, which has no effect on the extent of the obligations imposed on the State in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not aware of any countries that make a practice of making a reservation of the kind referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) See parts (4) and (9). There is no need to make such reservations, since treaty obligations cannot override the Constitution, or the federal system established by the Constitution. Nevertheless, consideration is given in appropriate cases to the making of a statement at the time Australia becomes a party to a treaty to signal that Australian States will play a role in the implementation of the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) No. When Australia signs or becomes party to a treaty, that is an exercise of sovereignty. International committees or other bodies established by treaties have no power to change Australian laws or policies, even if Australia is a party to the treaties which establish them. Changes to Australian law can only be effected by decisions of Australian (Commonwealth, State or Territory) parliaments or courts, and changes to Australian policies can only be introduced by Australian governments.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. On 16 December 1993, the Government approved the acquisition of two Newport class ships, USS Saginaw and USS Fairfax County, which are being decommissioned by the United States Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Subject to the US Government's approval, it was originally intended to decommission the first ship from the US Navy and commission it into RAN service on 28 June 1994 at Norfolk, Virginia. Australia was advised some two weeks prior to the ceremony that there was a delay in consideration by the US Senate Armed Services Committee. As a consequence, Congressional and Presidential approval is now unlikely before August 1994. As soon as those approvals are received, arrangements will be made for the first vessel to proceed to Australia with a RAN crew. On present planning, the second vessel will be brought to Australia by a US crew prior to commissioning into the RAN.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) My Department has advised me that its management information system does not enable it to provide this level of information about service pensioners with managed investments/shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department conducts quarterly updates for all pensioners with shares and managed investments in order to take account of the latest rates of return and to reassess pensions accordingly. Because a range of changes such as Consumer Price Index increases, rates of return changes, rent assistance increases, etc are actioned on the same payday it is not possible to identify changes relating to one specific aspect such as shares/managed investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the January 1994 quarterly update did not include any significant changes other than shares/managed investments so it is possible to use these figures to estimate the numbers of pensioners in the electoral divisions nominated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is known that the total number of service pensioners in each electorate in question is: (i) Fisher 5,148; (ii) Fairfax 3,936 and (iii) Wide Bay 3,756, a total of 12,840 or 3.6% of the national service pensioner population.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">0.2% of all service pensioners with shares or managed investments had their pensions cancelled as a result of the assessment of unrealised capital gains on their investments; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">16.5% of all cases with managed investments or shares received a reduction in their service pension of $7.30 per fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extrapolating the population figure for these electorates, assuming pensioners in these electorates are representative of the national trend and comparing it to the national figures arising from the January 1994 update of Departmental records, it is possible to estimate the number of pensioners living in Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay affected by the January update.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would therefore be reasonable to expect that as a result of the assessment of unrealised capital gains on their managed investments and/or shares at the January 1994 update, that of the pensioners living in Fisher, Fairfax or Wide Bay:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) less than 25 or 0.2% would have their pensions cancelled; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) less than 2120 or 16.5% would have lost part of their pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Exact savings figures are not available as re-assessments of service pensioner entitlements often correspond to changes in financial circumstances unrelated to the assessment of unrealised capital gain. However, the Department estimates savings for 1993/94 resulting from changes to the assessment of shares and Managed investments will total $7.24M.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It therefore follows that as 3.6% of pensioners live in the electorates of Fisher, Fairfax and Wide Bay, then on a percentage basis, $260,000 of the total $7.24M relates to these electorates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No new staff have been specifically employed in Fisher, Fairfax or Wide Bay. Nationally the Department allocated $787,000 for system programming changes to accommodate the provisions introduced in 1993.</PARA>
