<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to have this opportunity to speak in support of this package of taxation bills which covers a very wide range of concerns. I will, however, concentrate on just a few subjects that are dealt with in these bills. The bills have been around for a while. I am sure other members are pleased to have the opportunity to debate these bills today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia we have been witnessing over the last 12 months an impressive economic recovery, thanks to this government's responsible economic management, I would suggest&mdash;a recovery that has seen nearly 200,000 jobs created in the last year, economic growth travelling at or near 4.5 per cent, productivity increases at historic highs, corporate profitability higher than it has been in many years, and the lowest inflation rate in decades allowing business to grow and prosper. It is certainly important that business take advantage of the opportunities available to it. Interest rates and the movements in interest rates will always be a subject of debate. It is inevitable that interest rates will rise or fall as the demand for funds grows or declines, and interest rates are affected accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot of good news for growth and prosperity in Australia at the current time&mdash;no-one can deny that&mdash;despite the efforts of those opposite who go around scaremongering at every opportunity and playing down Australia's prosperity instead of getting behind it and promoting it. Whilst it is undoubtedly good news, more can always be done to promote growth and jobs. They are important to all of us, especially those less fortunate job seekers in our community. They are always a major priority for members on this side of the House. Many of the long-term unemployed are already being assisted through the various government initiatives contained in the Working Nation white paper and will continue to be assisted where that assistance is needed. They will not be thrown on the scrap heap like some members opposite would propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most pleasing aspects of the initiatives in Working Nation is that they place an emphasis on finding long-term, self-sustaining jobs for these people&mdash;jobs that will be there for many years&mdash;allowing them to plan and build a future for themselves. A great emphasis is placed on providing jobs in emerging or, in some cases, completely new industries that will take advantage of new markets that are only just being identified. These jobs will be there for many years because they have a commercial future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of assistance is to be encouraged and this emphasis on providing jobs for a commercial future should be applauded. Although employment is increasing to the point where we now have more than eight million people in work, more can always be done. I always emphasise that point. In particular, providing initiatives for industry in regional areas of Australia to invest and grow is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the regulations applying to pooled development funds in this legislation will encourage more regional small and medium sized enterprises to invest and grow and therefore provide jobs in regional areas. In Working Nation, the government announced that the rate of tax on income derived by a pooled development fund from its investments in small and medium sized enterprises will be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This change, which is designed to increase the attractiveness of the PDF program to investors, will apply to the assessment of PDFs for the 1994-95 year and later years of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) will divide the taxable income of the PDF into two components. Income from investing in small and medium sized enterprises will be taxed at 15 per cent, and the income from other sources will be taxed at 25 per cent. Simple rules will allocate the allowable deductions and the capital gains and losses of a PDF between the two components of taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the rate at which income derived by a pooled development fund, or PDF as it is often referred to, from its investments in small and medium sized enterprises is actually taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments cover a range of areas but the main ones are: providing for intercorporate dividend rebate allowable on dividends derived by a PDF to be calculated at the rate of tax applicable to the small and medium sized enterprises component of taxable income; setting out the rules for calculating the two components of PDF income&mdash;SME income component and unregulated investment component; making specific provision for the tax treatment of capital gains and capital losses of a PDF in calculating each component of taxable income; and reducing the concessional tax rate for PDFs from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in small and medium sized enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures follow some of the other initiatives designed to encourage PDFs to invest in small and medium sized enterprises developed earlier this year as part of the legislation that gave effect to the PDF initiatives in Working Nation. One of these was the removal of the restriction that PDFs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises. That was a good initiative that will lead to greater investment in SMEs by the pooled development funds. These further amendments moved by the legislation we are debating today will enhance the attractiveness of SMEs as possible areas for investment by the pooled development funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very encouraging to see these attempts being made to make better use of the PDFs. Pooled development funds were introduced in the One Nation statement of February 1992 by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The legislation has two objects. First, it is to establish a scheme under which companies and their shareholders can qualify for certain tax concessions. Secondly, it is to encourage the provision of funds to small and medium sized Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation, eligible corporations may be registered as pooled development funds to provide funds to corporations with assets not exceeding $30 million. To qualify as a PDF, a company has to comply with a number of criteria, including that it be incorporated and will implement capital raising and capital investment plans. The objective of these changes is to encourage more long-term investment in small and medium sized enterprises. The reason for the changes was expressed in Working Nation in the following way. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past attempts to increase the provision of equity for SMEs (small and medium sized enterprises) have not proved to be sufficiently effective. In particular, the Pooled Development Funds (PDFs) have not been attractive to investors.</PARA>
<PARA>This legislation will try to overcome that problem. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) has also said in the past that the PDF program has not had the anticipated impact on creating a pool of investment funds as only $35 million has been raised by PDFs. This is because there is a view that the incentive available under the program is not sufficient to compensate for the risk associated with this class of investment and because some of the operational rules have been seen as being overly restrictive. The sentiments expressed above have also been echoed by the chairperson of the Pooled Development Funds Registration Board, who stated in the annual report for 1992-93:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the PDFs have reported great difficulty in generating investor interest given the limited incentives that the Program offers. There is no incentive for superannuation funds to invest in a PDF and there has been a general lack of enthusiasm from banks and large corporations who obviously perceive the incentives to be insufficient.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst everyone accepts that PDFs could certainly have done better over the years, I think it is wrong to use such strong language to condemn them out of hand. Indeed, in the Senate a few months ago Senator Short, in one of the few examples of dissent over the PDF amendment, used the term `abject failure' to describe the PDFs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, few people would deny that PDFs have not been as successful as hoped. Any incentive designed to give small and medium sized enterprises a helping hand cannot, in all fairness, be called an abject failure. Certainly the incentives to invest could have been greater, and the government acknowledges this. But I would remind Senator Short that anyone can be wise in hindsight. In any case, the purpose of this bill is to offer greater incentives for PDFs to invest in the small and medium sized enterprise areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of incentive to invest in the SMEs is not related solely to the tax on profits. The Kelty report, for example, found that in the private sector the size and nature of the taxation benefit and the restrictions on what PDFs can invest in are blamed for the lack of success. Further, it states that private investors and money managers also complain that the taxation benefits offered are not significant and that benefits are structured so that investors do not receive them until the pooled development funds begin earning money, which sometimes is five years or more after their establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The incentives that this bill offers include the reduction of the tax rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the profits of such funds and their investment in small and medium sized enterprises. That is the core of it. This is sure to stimulate further activity in the small business sector, which is quite often rightly described as the backbone of the economy. It is a very important area, which I am sure everyone in this place acknowledges. The majority of new jobs that come about as a result of the recovery will be created in this sector. It is hoped that the changes proposed in this bill, and the other PDF legislation passed earlier this year, will contribute to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the raising of the limit to $50 million means that the pooled development regime may be opened up to companies too small to raise equity capital by way of a public float. In addition, the requirement that pooled development funds invest no more than a total of five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises has been abolished. This will encourage pooled development funds in sunrise and other high-tech industries. In addition to this, PDFs will now be entitled to invest up to 30 per cent of their capital in a particular investee company, whereas previously it was only 20 per cent. This move will make the due diligence costs to PDFs prior to investment more efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be little doubt that these changes will lead to more and more money being invested in small and medium sized enterprises from the pooled development funds, and the particular benefits to flow from this to regional areas will be substantial. Mr Speaker, most of us are representatives of regional electorates, including yourself, and it is always a great priority for us to focus on the needs of regions. Speaking as a representative of a regional electorate, and also coming from the banking and finance sector, I can certainly vouch for the fact that raising equity and start-up capital is much more difficult for a regional enterprise than it is for a major metropolitan one. That is simply because of the size alone and often the isolation and lack of understanding of what regions can actually offer, and some of Bill Kelty's work has really focused on the need to promote our regions a lot more. I can never emphasise that enough in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is obvious: there is a limit to the level of debt that any enterprise can bear, but the profit margin for regional enterprises, isolated as they often are from large consumer populations, tends to be much slimmer in the majority of cases, making access to equity capital all the more important for them. PDFs have been made more adaptable to regional areas in order to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke before about the need to make the jobs recovery substantial not only in terms of numbers, as it already is, but also in terms of sustainability. The jobs have to be in industries that will still be `going concerns' years from now. By necessity, that means that some of those jobs will be in industries that are only in their early stages at the moment or perhaps the opportunities have not even been identified yet. As we continue to expand the operations in the Asia-Pacific region, many opportunities will come up for those small and medium sized enterprises. These new and emerging industries have the potential to create many new jobs in the private sector, a significant proportion of which will require skills in technological fields which are very important fields that we should take every opportunity to expand in the future and certainly at the current time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, traditionally, banks and investment houses have been reluctant to take a risk on businesses like these and provide them with start-up capital and finance through those important early years, although there are encouraging signs that that attitude is changing. It is one area that certainly must change if we are going to help our industries grow and provide those much needed jobs. Of course, this makes small- and medium-sized enterprises perfect investment vehicles for the pooled development funds. They are the logical ones&mdash;particularly the SMEs in regional areas, as I mentioned before&mdash;and they must be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most attractive characteristics of the PDFs is that they allow individuals to invest in the region they live and work in. Those enterprises and PDFs belong to them, which is very important. They also tend to be better focused than the large financial institutions on the needs of smaller communities. Their smaller size and regional emphasis makes it easier for regional development organisations to develop and sustain projects suitable to the needs of regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday, 4 November, I had the pleasure of officially opening such a project in my electorate. In that capacity, I represented the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). I refer to the new Ipswich Transition Centre, which is a pilot project that is quite unique. It is quite well managed and well run. I expect that it will develop in other parts of Australia before too long. The minister has taken a great interest in the project. I am sure that the unemployed in my electorate of Oxley thank him for his substantial backing of employment initiatives in and around the city of Ipswich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition centre is a unique concept in training for the long-term unemployed. The great part about it is that it is actually working. The participants in the scheme are actually identifying gaps in the market where particular products are not available either locally or in Australia, and they are then producing the goods to fill those gaps. All of them are long-term unemployed. This sort of training is giving them not only the skills they need but also the industry they need. These people are actually creating new domestic industries by concentrating on import replacement and supplying the goods those industries need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre is already having a lot of success and has secured commercial markets for its products, which include sophisticated manufactured equipment for the medical field, particularly medical aids for the handicapped, such as wheelchairs and things we often just take for granted. These people are picking up opportunities and running with them. I congratulate them for their initiative in this regard. But the great thing is that the people at the centre did not say, `Somebody is already doing that.' They said, `We can do it better and do it locally,' and that is what has made this a great success story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this attitude, the centre is not only adding to Australia's productivity but also producing skilled workers, many of whom have already found employment in the private sector even before they have finished their time at the centre. I have spoken to people there who have been out of work for up to two or three years and who are now developing their own enterprises and getting back into work. In some cases, skilled tradesmen who previously could not find employment are being picked up by the centre, being motivated and are developing their own enterprises and creating their own employment. So it has been a great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre would be a perfect investment for a pooled development fund. I will certainly be doing everything I can to encourage the centre to get involved with pooled development funds. With these PDFs, hopefully the management will decide to expand and take up opportunities in future operations. They will give the necessary commercial backing to the transition centre. After a time, it should become self-sufficient, but it will become self-sufficient only if it gets that support from a good investment finance provider. I am sure that the pooled development funds can actually provide that for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains amendments to give effect to the research and development initiatives contained in Working Nation, which is another fine incentive by this government. The first change is that the shading-in rules, which currently apply where a company's research and development expenditure is between $20,000 and $50,000, will be eliminated. The full 150 per cent deduction will be allowable for 1994-95 and later years of income where total research and development expenditure is more than $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second amendment will allow certain expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia to be eligible for concession by, firstly, amending the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia that have been given prior approval by the Industry Research and Development Board; and, secondly, by amending the Industry Research and Development Act to give the board the power to approve proposed overseas research and development activities of companies that meet certain eligibility criteria. This will give the board the power to develop public guidelines specifying the criteria that companies must satisfy for their activities to be approved by the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third amendment will make changes to the Industry Research and Development Act to reduce the expenditure threshold from $1 million to $500,000 for companies registering jointly on or after 1 July 1994 with respect to the proposed research and development projects starting on that date. This change will facilitate the use of significant structures for smaller research and development projects, which is expected to benefit small and medium sized companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments before us today are extremely important. This government has put a lot of emphasis on restructuring and making our taxation system more adaptable to our companies in Australia to promote employment and industry growth. I was speaking yesterday to somebody about the tax law improvement project which is going to streamline our tax system. This government is bringing a lot of things together to ensure that we have a fair and equitable tax system in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994 and cognate bills: the Income Tax (Former Complying Superannuation Funds) Bill, the Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Bill, the Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill and the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello), the shadow Treasurer, last Tuesday spoke about the role of the Commonwealth Ombudsman standing up for taxpayers and about how the Ombudsman's office had provided considerable assistance to `persecuted taxpayers dealing with zealotry in the tax office'. The issue of taxation brings out an adversarial role in many people&mdash;in most of us perhaps at some time or another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly the tax office has to be seen to be fair. It has to be seen to conduct its affairs with due regard to the rights of individuals. In the last few days we have heard a lot in this place about the rights of individuals. I wonder whether we should not apply similar standards to the rights of individuals in the payment of taxation. There is great enthusiasm about defending people's privacy and making sure there is a whole range of civil rights out there, but when it comes to the payment of tax it seems that the Ombudsman's office is used more than would seem reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose the measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) relating to credit unions, pooled development funds, research and development activities, the rates of interest for calculating the superannuation guarantee charge and the development allowance. The deficit deferral tax imposed by the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill is consequent on changes to the instalment arrangements for the payment of company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions relating to non-complying superannuation funds are significant improvements, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acknowledged that fact. But the provisions governing employee share acquisition schemes are a somewhat different matter. The issue that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition brought out on Tuesday bears repeating. This bill will add another 28 pages of legislation to the FBT Assessment Act. Apparently the first step in simplifying an act is to add another 28 pages&mdash;extend the net before you can even get around to simplifying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear constant criticism of the tax act. I am sure all members receive this criticism from time to time. The tax act is increasingly complex, and I have just given a very good example of this: in order to simplify the tax act, we have added another 28 pages of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the amount of revenue raised through the FBT. In 1986 the FBT raised $535 million. In 1994-95 it is forecasted to be $3.2 billion. It seems quite anomalous to me that a tax that was designed initially to tax some unreasonable perks has suddenly become such a milch cow for the government. Apparently, the FBT results in wins and losses for government. The FBT on parking was expected to raise $90 million, but it raised only $32 million. My understanding is that Treasury has moved to abolish the FBT on parking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise the issue of national savings via employee share acquisition schemes, superannuation, et cetera. The FitzGerald report alerted the nation to its appalling savings record, particularly by historical standards. If we as a nation wish to control our flow of money in such a way that an imbalance in the system results in too much of it going to Treasury and not enough remaining in individuals' hands, then that ultimately takes away incentive for individuals to save and it brings to the fore the whole issue of our national savings program and investment for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to hold an honours degree in economics to understand our weakness in this area. The government acknowledges it; the previous Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, acknowledged it. But nothing happens. The taxation juggernaut still rolls on. It has been a long time since this country has come to terms with the correct balance between investment, revenue and savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone can put better what has happened in recent times than former senator Peter Walsh. Most of us would have seen the article in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `Banana road to republic'. I will quote a few dot points because they are worth remembering. His first paragraph is a real gem:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is on track to become the world's most politically correct banana republic.</PARA>
<PARA>He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is blowing out&mdash;probably to 5 per cent of GDP or more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Budget&mdash;which according to One Nation's slack fiscal objectives was supposed to be in surplus next year&mdash;is now projected to be still in deficit by 1 per cent of GDP the year after next.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That permissive target recedes every time (about every second month recently) . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Largely because of slack fiscal policy, interest rates have been rising. The 10-year bond rate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and we all know this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is higher in real terms than it was in 1989-90.</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Walsh also talks about the increase in the Australian dollar. Whilst acknowledging that it is perhaps contrary to the view that we are heading towards banana republicanism, he warns us that the dollar can crash just as quickly as it rises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> a small headline appeared, `Forecast warns tax rises may be needed', under the name of George Megalogenis. The article says that the pressure on the federal government's budget strategy has intensified despite the fact that there will be a reduction in the deficit by $427 million. The pressure is going to come next year, which may be causing some of the chatter about an early election. That will be quite critical in the Prime Minister's consideration of that factor. The article further states that Access Economics paints `a grim picture for next year with the warning that $2.2 billion in new spending cuts or tax rises will be needed to keep the deficit reduction target on track by 1996-97'. There is a nice little dig about two-thirds of the way down the column, which I presume comes from the spokesperson from Access Economics:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Deficit Daleks are those who advocate faster deficit reduction before Mr Keating is prepared to announce it.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister apparently argues that a stronger and expected recovery will bring home the bacon by a fiscal dividend, which will make it easy to achieve the target reduction in the budget deficit to one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. But former Senator Walsh disputes that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how do we pay for these tax rises? The government said that it will not cut expenditure. It will only tax us more; that is the only option it has. One way of paying for them will be that old favourite, that perennial of indirect taxation. The legislation that we are debating in the House is important; it is important to make the points about FBT, about saving, about superannuation; and about employee share schemes, et cetera. We have to see it in the context of the overall economic picture. We have to see it in the context that, in 1973, 13.5 per cent of the population were on government benefits; now something like 35 per cent of the population are on government benefits. So that is the outcome. I am sure that that is not in the best interests of the nation. It is important to give people the opportunity&mdash;that is why I sit on this side of the House; I have a different philosophy&mdash;to be able to provide for themselves rather than taxing everybody to put too many people onto government benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How are we going to cover this tax rise that the government looks like it might have to impose next year? The old perennial has to be excise on petrol and diesel. It is worth looking at the history of this tax. My records show that it first came in on 15 March 1956&mdash;it may have been a little earlier than that, but that is where my records start&mdash;at 2c a litre. When the Fraser government left office, the rate was 6.1c or 6.2c a litre. What is it now? As at 1 August 1994, it is 34.1c a litre. So there we have it&mdash;a nice little number to collect the taxation. It was 6c when Labor came into office; it is now 34c. When we look at what reputable economists are saying must happen next year, there is no doubt that it will go up again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise is a very unfair tax on regional Australia because it impacts disproportionately on our urban cousins. If we look at the balance between income tax, excise and wholesale sales tax, we see that excise is loaded; there is an unfair imposition on those of us who live in regional Australia. That is very much part of the reason why those in regional Australia have lower incomes than those in metropolitan Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see a government nibbling at the edges. It is strong on rhetoric but, when it comes to the fundamentals, when it comes to trusting people to invest money, to encouraging people to have a go and create employment, the strong hand of the executive government through Treasury is reaching into people's pockets and then dolling the money out at some later point and making good people of themselves. What we need is a government that has confidence in the individuals of Australia, in the entrepreneurs of Australia and in the ordinary working people of Australia to give them a go. Let them go out there, earn money and pay tax in a tax system which is fair and equitable to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this discussion on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and the associated tax bills. I want to pick up where the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) left off. He made a rambling, maudlin contribution this morning. I want to touch on his remarks about fuel excise. What he conveniently ignored and did not tell his constituents in this discussion is the fact that the big increase on fuel&mdash;it was effectively a tax&mdash;was brought in by the Fraser government in 1977-78 in the form of a crude oil levy. That was the major increase in the form of a tax on fuel. It affected people in regional Australia. But he conveniently ignored that. He conveniently did not bring forward the fact that in the mid-1980s the crude oil levy was then absorbed into excise. To make a comparison of what the excise level was under the Fraser government and what it is today would be a comparison of apples and oranges. My colleague might at some later stage go back and check the records or put a question on notice. That will show him and his constituents quite clearly where the major increase in fuel excise came from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fuel excise is a form of general revenue. It helps pay for hospitals, health care, schools, defence and roads. Roads are extremely important in regional Australia. In fact, all of those services are important to regional Australia. It would have been better to make some mention of those matters in this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that concerns me greatly is the remarks by the honourable member and the opposition in relation to the special measures taken by this government in Working Nation to deal with the long-term unemployed. Let us be frank about it: under the provisions of Working Nation, there is a decided preference for providing employment for at least six months between now and the end of the parliamentary term to people who have been unemployed for 18 months or longer. That has been referred to by the opposition as a fiddle with the unemployment figures&mdash;taking the long-term unemployed off the list, giving them a bit of work and putting them back on at the top of the list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What opposition members are really saying is that people who have been unemployed the longest should remain unemployed; that the people who have been unemployed the longest, the families that have not had an income earner the longest, should be condemned to remain in that state; that those people should not be given any preference in trying to get back into the work force to raise the currency of their skills and knowledge, which would help them get back into employment. There are two things to do: one is to give those people priority and a chance to get back to work; the other is to make the economy and business grow so that we can create lasting jobs. That is what part of Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) is about. I find it utterly repugnant to have the kind of discussion we are having from the other side of the House about measures to give preference to long-term unemployed people and their families in getting some work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the regions of Australia, it is history; everybody knows that unemployment levels in regional Australia are always several per cent higher than those in metropolitan Australia and several per cent higher than the national figures. In the central coast region, particularly in the Hunter region, as far back as one wants to go, unemployment has always been three to 3 1/2 per cent higher than the national figure. A very simple reason for that is that the economic base in that region is narrower. There is no opportunity for alternative employment. All of us who come from those sorts of regions know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all of us in this place seek to broaden the economy of our region and to create more employment, opportunities and business there. It is a very difficult task, because people in business make decisions about where they locate their activities, where they will have the best access to markets and where it will give the best bottom line result. They are about making money; that is why they are in business. They are not in business for the general good or welfare of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference between the opposition and the government lies with what the Liberal and National parties are doing about the regions. They are doing nothing. In 1982, in my region of the Hunter, in the midst of the Fraser induced recession, BHP decided to pull out of steel. BHP and the steel industry would have withdrawn completely from the Hunter and the consequences of that would have flown to all of the other businesses that hang off BHP. Multiplier effects would have arisen for associated employers through their doing business with BHP. The opposition parties' approach was to say that it was bad luck. At the time, Prime Minister Fraser virtually said that if BHP decided to shut down in the Hunter region, that was its commercial decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference is that a steel plan was formulated and implemented when we came into government. BHP now has just over 3,000 employees instead of about 12,000. But half of its production goes to export and it is producing more steel at the Newcastle plant than it has ever produced in its history. The difference is that we are doing something about the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following on from that are the regional initiatives which target growth in regions. What we are providing in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) in respect of pooled development funds specifically addresses the equity capital needs of small- to medium-sized businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it is achieving is a long way ahead of what you are achieving, because your efforts and contribution have been zilch. As far as you are concerned, regions are forgotten areas of Australia. Do not let us have any cant that you are concerned about the regions; you are not concerned about the regions at all. You talk about them, but you do not have any policies that are positively designed to achieve growth and generate employment in the regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both the Hunter and central coast regions have a higher unemployment level than the national level of unemployment because of the reasons I have stated earlier. New businesses, new ideas, new technology and new know-how need new capital. The development of those businesses and ideas has always been impeded by the scarcity of not only equity capital but patient equity capital&mdash;investors who are prepared to put in some money and wait two or five years for a return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great flaws in Australian commerce and Australia's investment structure is that the safest and largest investment funds, the safest and the largest bankers and the people who one would expect to invest in business are only concerned with the safest risks. They want a quick return, not a long or patient return like Japan does. They want a quick return with safe risk. One might as well say, `Well, you may as well not exist for new business. You may as well not exist in this country in respect of small- to medium-sized business.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds, the idea of putting together investors to provide funds to an organisation, are to provide a source of patient equity capital. Where the fund can invest in those new businesses, there are limits on how much it can put in and at what level. I will come to those matters a little later on. Pooled development funds are to provide patient equity capital to small, growing and new businesses, which is what they have always needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligible investment companies, formed in Australia, registered under the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992, address this problem of small business. It is a one nation initiative. The objective is to provide patient equity capital for eligible activities to resident Australian companies with assets that do not exceed $50 million: that is, small to medium enterprises&mdash;and small can be very small. The greatest businesses started with the smallest beginnings. So this legislation addresses that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds can also make short-term unregulated investments if available funds have not been committed to equity investments. But, put simply, PDFs, or pooled development funds, are companies meeting investment criteria designed to provide development capital for small to medium sized enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be an inducement, in the government's view, to investors to put money into those funds. Those inducements are provided through this legislation by way of taxation benefits. Working Nation provided for a reduction of the taxation rate on the earnings of pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, and that is incorporated in the legislation before us. The 25 per cent rate was levied when this government's initiative to create pooled development funds was announced originally in the One Nation package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are constraints attaching to the legislation. The act imposes a number of constraints. With investment in a pooled development fund, unless the investor is a bank or life office, an investor cannot hold more than 30 per cent of the issued shares in the fund. That is 20 per cent under existing legislation; it will go to 30 per cent with the amendment before us. An investor cannot increase investment in a company with assets exceeding $50 million without approval of the PDF board and may not, without board approval, acquire shares in a single investee company if the share value of those shares exceeds 30 per cent of the PDF shareholders' funds. If the board does grant investment above this amount, it can specify a period in which the 30 per cent rule must be complied with. As I said earlier, before 1 July 1994 the limit was 20 per cent and the board did not have that provision for discretion. We believe that these are wise constraints. They are designed to help small to medium businesses, which I have been speaking about, get the capital they need on which to grow their business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reaction to the government's taxation investment limit changes for pooled development funds has been that the office of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, is receiving between 50 and 60 inquiries per week. The Pooled Development Fund Authority has now registered 19 pooled development funds which have intentions to raise over $350 million. The funds are to be used to meet long-term equity financing needs of small to medium enterprises, an area that traditional finance institutions have been reluctant to become involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aims of the government's pooled development fund initiative is that pooled development funds, we hope, will look at particular industries or locations. That is where the relevance for regional Australia comes in, relevance for the regions I represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that are being introduced by this legislation are already bearing fruit in responses. There are 19 funds already established. Last Friday I was able to attend a launch of the prospectus of the Hunter First Ltd fund in Newcastle. That fund is being set up to raise up to $15 million from investors in the Hunter region and superannuation funds. It aims to serve the Newcastle area and, naturally, the adjoining Hunter region. The fund sees Newcastle as an ideal investment, as an export hub&mdash;an area that is set for strong growth in exports over the next decade. It plans to invest in firms that have a $5 million to $50 million asset base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, those people and organisations that are contemplating investing in the fund will look at the prospectus. They will examine it critically and take investment and financial advice from people who are able to advise on those matters before they make a decision about whether or not to invest in the fund. As I have outlined, they are the aims of the fund and the background to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses in the Hunter also see opportunities to transfer management skills. The directors of Hunter First are experienced in business. They have a track record of managing small- to medium-sized enterprises. As they say in the prospectus, the businesses they invest in will share in the benefits of this experience, and long-term equity will not be provided to enterprises that are not considered long-term entities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter First launch last Friday for the five members from the Hunter&mdash;the honourable members for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Paterson (Mr Horne) and me&mdash;was a great conclusion to a very good week for the Hunter. Some of you would have noticed in the main committee room the exhibition of `Hunter advantage' sponsored by the Newcastle Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It was on display from Monday evening until Thursday afternoon and showed the advantages of doing business in the Hunter and the capabilities and opportunities developed by the region's businesses. It was a snapshot of some of the successful firms in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be that kind of focus&mdash;be it on the Hunter or any other region of Australia&mdash;so that we start to pay attention to, and invest in, regional Australia. That is where the growth is going to come from and that is where the jobs are needed. That is where the higher levels of unemployment are being borne, and that is where larger numbers of people have been suffering from a lack of income. The marketing of the Hunter that I have referred to will produce results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the exhibitors that were here last week were enthusiastic about the reception they received and the interest that was shown in their activities. Mr Deputy Speaker, you probably saw the Medicab that was on display. Well over 1,000 people saw the tourism potential of the region. NIB Health Funds and Shortland Electricity saw the potential of doing business outside the region so that inter-region linkages can be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall not tell all of my colleagues here in this building how to organise such an exhibition, even though I have been asked to a number of times. It is a matter of the initiative of members from those regions. The important thing is that we brought to the capital of this nation a presentation of regional Australia. We showed this place what regional Australia can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have a mandate to expand the businesses in our respective regions. If we are to provide jobs and activity to keep our businesses going, we need finance. Over and over in our regions of the central coast and the Hunter, the major issue that comes forward is the lack of finance, patient equity capital and people who are prepared to have a go. As I said earlier, the large investors and the traditional lenders are only interested in safe risks and a quick rate of return. They think, `To hell with the rest of Australia.' So it is important we have this legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Four broad problems in small firm finance have come forward: a lack of understanding between small firm borrowers and banks; the lack of a developed equity market for small firms; the special financial needs of exporters; and the special finance needs of small innovators. All of them are going to be helped by the legislation that is before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cast your mind back to the way that small- and medium-sized businesses have traditionally been treated by the banking system. The banking system has a history of ultraconservatism&mdash;of wanting to deal only with the businesses that are virtually guaranteed to succeed and only if they have abundant security. That is not how the entrepreneurs and paper shufflers dealt with the explosion of the late 1980s, when Westpac and ANZ made mammoth losses and we saw a buccaneer attitude in large corporate Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Down at the real level, from where the jobs have to come&mdash;that is, small business&mdash;the most stringent conditions are applied to borrowing. I have seen in my electorate what I consider to be utterly ruthless cases whereby banks taking over small businesses have rigorously applied the conditions attaching to those businesses. Yet the large corporations with billions of dollars of debt have managed to get out of the banking system. The same approach is not taken in respect of recovering that money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bank files of small business people often reveal a mortgage on the homes of those people. They are easy to grab, and the banks grab them. Small business not only has that ruthless treatment exhibited towards it; it also has to pay high interest rates. The interest rates and the transaction rates that the banking system applies to small businesses have always been much higher and much harsher than those applied to large business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The firms we need to grow to create jobs&mdash;the small to medium enterprises&mdash;are being forced by the traditional system to pay more for their money and to put up more security than larger firms do. That makes business riskier for those small firms. I hope with this legislation, and the growth we are seeing already in the number of inquiries and the number of funds being registered and formed, that we will see a new availability of pay to equity capital to our small to medium enterprises. Given what I have said, I hope that we will be able to look forward to a situation where the banking systems and traditional lenders will be a bit fairer in the way they deal with small business. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to what my colleague the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) had to say on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and cognate bills. I want to make the point that the availability of funds&mdash;equity and loan funds&mdash;for business of all kinds would be far higher had our level of national savings not deteriorated to the extent it has. The Commonwealth, in recent years, has contributed very considerably to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the fact that there is a Commonwealth government borrowing requirement of $50 billion over the space of a little more than two years, bringing the total Commonwealth borrowings to $90 billion, we begin to understand the inroads being made into national savings by the Commonwealth government. That is merely because it cannot bring itself to balance budgets. The honourable member for Shortland was talking about a symptom, an unavoidable consequence, of a profligate Commonwealth government, in particular, because the states have reversed their inroads into the available savings in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating these bills cognately. My comments will be confined to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994. It is yet another omnibus tax bill which deals with 11 separate tax issues and makes many further amendments to various tax acts. Most of the amendments proposed in the bill amend the Income Tax Act 1936 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Other acts, such as the Income Tax Act 1986, are also to be amended by these measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have had occasion to say in this place on many occasions, there is a need to reduce the cost of compliance with tax laws. It is obvious that tax changes should be kept to a minimum and where changes do occur they should be aimed at simplifying the law with a commensurate fall in compliance costs. However, under Labor, tax amendments have proliferated to such an extent that the law is almost unintelligible, compliance costs are exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime. Stability and certainty are key concepts in the management of an efficient, effective and fair tax system. This is a theme I will return to later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the government has made two welcome contributions to the potential reduction of compliance costs. The first is a draft rewrite of the tax law as it deals with substantiation provisions. This new draft is about half the size of the old and is written in easy to understand plain English. It is a clear improvement on the old. It is yet to be seen if the rewrite will be satisfactory. I certainly hope that it is. Plain English is a prerequisite to making tax law more easily understood and is clearly one method of contributing to lower compliance costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second contribution the government has made is the inclusion of compliance cost impact statements with all proposed amendments which come before the parliament in bill form. This proposal, amongst others, was originally made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report No. 326. It is a promising development that the government has accepted the recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only in the fullness of time, of course, will it be shown whether the projected change in compliance cost, as stated in the compliance cost impact statement, is accurate. Nevertheless, that is a good start, and the government should receive credit for finally adopting this measure. It is a recognition by the government that changes to the tax laws bring with them changes to the cost of compliance. Let us hope that with the inclusion of these compliance cost impact statements the government will restrain itself from making tax law amendments which increase further the costs of compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, the bill deals with 11 tax issues, though on this occasion because of time constraints I intend to touch on only those that relate to the return of deducted superannuation contributions, to employee share acquisition schemes and to pooled development funds. The amendment dealing with the return of deducted superannuation will amend section 82AAQ of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The stated purpose of this amendment is to overcome arrangements whereby the surplus from an employer sponsored superannuation fund is paid back to the sponsoring employer or to an associate of the sponsoring employer in a way that avoids the payment of tax on receipt of the surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will have retrospective effect from 1 July 1988. There is some merit in the government's position that where employers receive repatriated surpluses for which tax deductions have already been received tax should be payable. If it is not paid, these employers would receive an undeserved benefit which would impact negatively on the integrity of the tax base. If prospectively applied it seems okay. However, the aspect which I find abhorrent and totally unacceptable is the retrospective nature in this provision. Retrospectivity, as a rule, should be avoided. Only where retrospectivity does not bring about losers is it acceptable, though it should still be avoided in the majority of cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment in this bill relating to children's income also has a retrospective component. The commencement date of provisions relating to the treatment of children's income is 1 July 1979, although it appears that this piece of retrospectivity is not malicious in its application and is therefore tolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 October 1994 by Tony Featherstone gives an indication that retrospective tax legislation by this government is not unusual. He cites other examples of retrospectivity over the past 12 months. It is clear that such retrospectivity undermines any certainty, credibility and fairness in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the constant stream of tax amendment bills coming before this place, as well as the draft rulings from the Australian Taxation Office, it should be obvious to all that the taxpaying community does not need the added uncertainty of retrospective tax changes. There must be community confidence in the certainty of the law&mdash;certainty that today's legal act does not tomorrow become the trigger for a penalty or obligation by law created subsequent to that legal act and applied retrospectively. With tax law, taxpayers need to be able to determine their tax obligations with some degree of certainty. As Tony Sloan has written in the latest edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Accountant</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With retrospective tax legislation, not only must taxpayers assess their tax position according to the current law, they must also assess the law itself. In other words, they must look behind the words in the legislation, work out what the draftsperson really meant to say and assume that one day the legislation will be retrospectively amended along those lines.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sloan continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if legislators cannot get the legislation right in the first place with virtually unlimited resources, how can taxpayers be expected to pre-empt what they really meant to say when their resources are so scarce?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislators should be accountable for their transgressions, not taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the buck should stop in this parliament. Clearly, the government should have to pay the price for its shoddy drafting of legislation. It is not good enough to expect taxpayers to pay for poor tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example of the inequity of retrospective lax laws is case 4825, which was heard by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in December 1988. To cut the story short, a family leased its service station to a major oil company for $200,000 in March 1986. The deal was done several months after the government announced it would introduce a capital gains tax, but no mention of any substantive changes to the tax treatment of premiums on leases was made in the announcement. This was also the case in later press releases on the same subject issued in November 1985 and March 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when the capital gains tax bill was eventually introduced into this parliament in May 1986, it did subject leases to the capital gains tax. The AAT ruled that CGT had to be paid on the lease but Deputy President C.J. Bannon QC, when delivering his reasons for the decision, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have previously indicated, this is a difficult case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The taxpayer and his wife appeared to me to be hardworking Australian citizens who were in financial difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no element of tax avoidance in this case, only conflict with the new law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is with regret that I reach the conclusion that the objection decisions under review be affirmed, and that the objections to the assessments be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA>This decision does highlight both the iniquity and inequity of retrospective tax laws, especially when the logic for retrospectively applying the capital gains tax in this case was because of the earlier press releases which did not in the event make mention of lease arrangements. Retrospectivity, as it is applied in this bill, to the return of deducted superannuation contributions is a denial of natural justice and a repudiation of fairness in our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is the tax system almost unintelligible, compliance costs exorbitant and there is no stability in the tax regime, but also, with retrospectivity, there is a serious element of guesswork in trying to get an understanding of tax law. Stability and certainty in the tax system are key concepts this government simply has not been able to grasp. I intend to vote against this clause at the consideration in detail stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the changes to employee share acquisition schemes, ESAS. This bill amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to impose fringe benefits taxes on employees' share fringe benefits, which arise when an employee acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The amount to be subjected to FBT will be the difference between the amount paid and the market value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two concessional arrangements in the bill which provide means by which the amount of FBT can be reduced, but these are not satisfactory. The premise upon which the government has decided to impose FBT on ESAS is that there is a potential and a likelihood that ESAS could be abused by employers and employees as a means of providing increased remuneration by non-PAYE means. This would have the potential of corrupting the tax base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fears of the government seem to be without foundation, because there is absolutely no evidence of widespread abuse of these schemes. The big problem with the government's heavy-handed approach is that it will destroy ESAS. Any abuse of ESAS could have been dealt with by regulation or new legislation to accompany section 22AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as was proposed by Dr Vince FitzGerald. The potential to abuse ESAS for tax avoidance purposes could have been eliminated by introducing measures such as imposing limits on the amount of contributions for ESAS and imposing a limit over which the ESAS benefits could be deferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr FitzGerald, in his report to the government on national saving, estimated that, by the end of the decade, ESAS could raise national savings by half of one per cent of GDP&mdash;or around $2 billion in today's dollars&mdash;and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars. Already, TNT has announced its intention to freeze its plans to widen its ESAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect of ESAS which I believe is of some importance to our longer term economic growth and increased levels of productivity. ESAS is also an industrial relations issue that helps draw workers and management together. In firms where workers are also shareholders of the firm, workers have a superior work ethic which understandably flows from their desire to see the firm in which they have a stake do well. In other words, it is in the interests of the workers to increase profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that the very notion of ESAS has put the fear of God into the hearts of Labor's mates&mdash;the trade union bosses. Many unions fear ESAS because employees who own shares shed their `them and us' mentality and therefore lose any incentive to engage in petty and bloody-minded industrial action. This is possibly an unintended consequence of imposing the fringe benefits tax on ESAS&mdash;an unintended consequence which Labor is happy to live with and which will be lauded by Labor's union mates. The last word from the Australian Taxation Institute on this provision is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The "flipping" of the taxation of employee share benefits out of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 . . . into the FBT regime is a major design change. It adds another significant compliance obligation onto employer companies at a time when the existing compliance obligations under the FBT regime are otherwise being strongly criticised. There is no real attempt to explain why this aspect was considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>There you have it. The bill sets out amendments to the pooled development fund&mdash;PDF&mdash;scheme which were first mooted in the Working Nation statement and further foreshadowed in the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill 1994, which we debated in this place on 28 June this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment now before us will reduce the rate of tax on income earned by pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This is the third shot the government has had at this. Nevertheless, this will apply only to income derived from investments in small- and medium-sized enterprises, and I welcome that. This is something that industry and, in particular, the market leader, the Greenchip group, has been demanding for some time. Greenchip has always maintained that the original tax rate of 30 per cent and the subsequently amended tax rate and current tax rate of 25 per cent were too high, considering that many major institutional investors are taxed at only 15 per cent. This amendment brings an element of reality into the tax regime affecting the PDFs. The objective of the PDF scheme to channel equity into small- and medium-sized firms is commendable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, like so many of the One Nation statement initiatives, the program has failed to live up to expectations, and the pooled development funds have failed to attract institutional support. Though it is unlikely the PDFs will ever come close to meeting the expectations placed on them in the One Nation statement, this reduction in the tax rate to 15 per cent and the amending act of June are both positive developments that could assist in the provision of equity capital for small- and medium-sized businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other point I will make about the bill currently before us relates to changes to research and development tax concessions. There are three amendments, which I will not detail as I am very nearly out of time but which I am sure other speakers will cover if they get the opportunity. These changes are a positive development which should provide further encouragement for firms to increase their expenditure on R&amp;D. That can only be good for us in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, for the consideration in detail stage the government has dropped on us more than four pages of closely typed amendments. This is yet another example of the legislative incompetence of this government. We have an omnibus bill to consider. Having digested the information in that, and before we get to debate the original amending bill, we get something like this before us and we are expected to intelligently legislate on tax in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with what is a virtual raft of tax legislation we should do so in the context of events of this week. No doubt the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will have arranged a number of dorothy dixers for question time to tell us how he is going to change the Australian economy and how through his agreements at APEC the people of Australia will be better off. I must point to Budget Paper No. 6 in this regard and say that they had better be better off because otherwise our children are in for a desperate time when one considers that, as that paper indicates and on the Prime Minister's own indication and the indication of the Treasurer (Mr Willis), it is anticipated that in 1997-98 we will be expending from revenue $10,000  million in interest to cover the cost of the borrowings of the Prime Minister as he goes out election after election buying votes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great pity of that is that the people who are going to have to pay it off do not get a vote yet. I find it outrageous with respect to the future of our children, who are still in education establishments, that in that year as much will be spent on interest as will be spent on education, according to those budget papers. To think that the defence of our nation will have exactly the same amount spent on it as the amount spent on interest is an extremely bad balance of funding and one which this Prime Minister avoids by telling us that it is all in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed for this region if Australia can achieve a truly competitive stance may drag us out of that hole. Without a competitive stance there is no hope. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, might ask me: what has this got to do with taxation? I am sure you would not, because you represent a substantial number of manufacturing interests in your electorate and drew to the attention of the House many times when I was shadow minister for small business the problems those people confront when competing with the rest of the world. You would understand that our taxation regime is fundamental to their ability to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to spend a little time today talking about how some of these proposals and the fundamentals of our tax system if not altered will tear asunder any agreement that the Prime  Minister has made with these other countries. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, every time we raise the issue of tax rates and the position of Australia as a highly or lowly taxed nation we get much selective reporting. When it comes to taxation, Sweden and the OECD developed countries are raised and we are told that we do very nicely, thank you, but a comparison is never made with the Asian nations, where we have just made a commitment to funnel most of our economic activity, where we expect to compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, unless we set targets for tax in terms of quantum, quality and administration similar to those proposed in what is a relatively short time in the life of a nation for a zero tariff regime, we had better ensure that the government is not putting lead into the saddlebags of our competing businesses. A number of proposals within these measures certainly do not remove any lead. In fact, in some cases they will add to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to outline two aspects of the APEC proposition. One aspect, which is being painted so brightly by the Prime Minister, relates to Australia selling products to other parts of the world&mdash;that is if the transport workers do not go on strike and we can deliver these products to the poor. But the other side of any arrangement of this nature is import competition. A lot of primary producers and manufacturers within Australia have not expanded to the point where they want to export. They are unable to fill the local market. But, under the arrangements proposed, it is a two-way street. Clearly, the new arrangements will make it easier for overseas producers or manufacturers to enter our markets and take away business from the people who seek to serve the local market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax system is also fundamental. I wish to give two examples of the effects of tax. As was mentioned in the House this week, citrus producers along the Murray River and in nearby areas have to pay the equivalent of $2,000 per semi-trailer load per week in tax in order to access the orange juice market. However, their Brazilian competitors do not have to pay tax because they deliver by international sea transport&mdash;which is probably the cheapest form of transport in all the world&mdash;straight into the huge markets of Melbourne and Sydney. Some 85 per cent of the Australians who live in those areas live very close to our ports. A huge advantage is given to citrus growers in Brazil over our own citrus growers because of the status of our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to the car industry. I am sure that people will be very interested to know what the Prime Minister has committed us to with his zero tariff regime. Malaysia, for instance, which has quite an efficient car manufacturing industry, has its own car which is coming to Australia. In Australia, our tax system adds an invisible $800 to the cost of manufacturing every car in Australia. That is the sort of lead in the saddlebags of our car manufacturers that they do not get back if they export the vehicle. They cannot recover that tax when competing with overseas exporters to our country. The tax system is fundamental when determining whether this glorious proposal of the Prime Minister will work. It is about time that we started to look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the bills deal with dividend imputation and how the proposal which I fundamentally support will operate under a new tax regime. In an effort to convince Australia that it is doing something about its borrowings and its deficit, the government is continually bringing forward the time at which people pay their tax. That is a good trick but, as I said, it is like the loaves and fishes trick. You are only robbing from tomorrow for today. It makes a budget look very pretty, but gradually these things work themselves out of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some fairly massive growth in company taxation was forecast in the budget. The inference was that this was in some way the product of this wonderful growth that we are getting at the moment, three-quarters of which is funded by money borrowed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that it was a case of double dipping. The government has brought forward the quarterly payments that are made by companies. In fact, most companies will pay 125 per cent tax this financial year. They will pay five quarterly payments. It looks good if the government says this is its policy for reducing the budget deficit, but next year companies will only make four payments. It is working with mirrors. As a result, the government had to alter the imputation arrangement to make sure that the tax credits of those companies that pay tax&mdash;the larger ones that actually have shareholders in the real world; thousands of companies only have proprietors as shareholders and they seldom get any dividends&mdash;can be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with that except that it raises the issue of imputation.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well aware of the background to imputation. It does not bring any credit to our side of politics, either, that successive governments carried on with the double taxation of company income. The company was taxed at the company tax rate and any dividends passed on to shareholders, be they personal or company shareholders, were taxed again through whatever process applied. The current Prime Minister, then Treasurer, brought to the parliament a proposal where tax would be paid by companies and then the companies were able to pass on the tax credit applicable to the shareholders. So in truth the company tax credit was only passed on once. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether any competent tax academics or others have ever addressed this decision in terms of the economic activity it will create and the creation of a competitive environment in the international market that our companies will have to operate in under the APEC agreement. I have always wondered why&mdash;and I know the answer&mdash;more consideration was not given to the reverse proposal which would have meant that no tax was applied to the company other than by way of withholding tax on its distributions, whatever they might be. Shareholders out there would say, `That is a dreadful thing; you are going to let BHP off paying tax and tax its shareholders.' The simple fact is that it would still be applying one component of tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing the competitive stance of BHP, which would be the biggest company, and a farmer in my electorate, who would be the smallest, we find that the rules on how people are taxed are changed. In other words, they can go on developing their business and repaying their debts, be they drought generated or expansion generated, tax free, yet when they distribute money either through dividends or some other process they pay tax. I assume that if the then Treasurer made that choice he would have found it more complex and maybe a bit more difficult to collect the tax. I guess that was fundamental to the government's decision to say it is a lot easier to tax BHP than its hundreds of thousands of shareholders. I wonder whether anyone ever asked the question: what would it have done for the economy and what would it have done for job creation if the government had gone down the other road?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be labelled tomorrow as saying this is the way it should operate; I am just disappointed that I have never seen a debate on that issue in the media, amongst our academics, or anywhere else. The outcome, from the government's point of view, was that it would have reduced revenue. I assume it would have in the short term, but after a period of time people will not invest in companies that do not pay dividends. Once the dividend stream was expanded, as it would have been, I presume the net result to government would have been the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at why we should make our companies so efficient, we have to seek means whereby we comply with the international treaties on all these things. If you pay a subsidy to GATT, or the World Trade Organisation as we are about to call it, or APEC&mdash;however it intends to control the agreements made&mdash;it is going to drop on you like a tonne of bricks. If you just happen to have a different tax regime or if, for instance, you do not collect fuel tax, that is quite acceptable to GATT. There is nothing in GATT that says you have got to tax fuel, that you have got to have a payroll tax. All these issues have been addressed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge is now before this government to see what it can do, seeing the Prime Minister signed our lives away. The Prime Minister has gone up there and signed a document and, in typical fashion, has not bothered to tell anybody what we are in for yet. Certain people, like Mr Mahathir, have some concerns&mdash;I am not supporting his particular case&mdash;and I fundamentally agree with free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have huge opportunities to be a supplier to this gigantic market. But we are playing in a very big league. We are playing with the two biggest economies in the world&mdash;America and Japan. If we do not get our labour market and our taxation operations right, whilst we have prime ministers who are prepared to prop up our living standard with borrowing, we will be the market to those countries, not the supplier&mdash;until, of course, they cut off our credit. I note&mdash;and I might want to expand on it in another debate&mdash;that it was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the other day that, as part of its trade negotiations with America, the Japs said, `If you heavy us any further, we are going to bring our money home.' If they can say that to America, one wonders what they could say to Australia in its state of indebtedness that has been generated by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I condemn this expansion of tax, making these inroads into people, but I did want to make some comments&mdash;because this legislation gave me the opportunity to do so&mdash;on whether or not we have imputation right. I really think that it would be a good government that went out in an open and honest way and said, `Is there a better way to tax business?' I am personally very attracted to the idea that maybe we should not tax business. This is a business&mdash;a piece of paper. It does not enjoy profit. It is people who enjoy profit and, of course, it might be more sensible to tax them. But I do not want to be seen as a proponent. I am bringing this matter before the parliament so that somebody somewhere might just think about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other sections of the legislation deals with pooled development funds. The government, having seen them fail in its first proposal, is in there giving them specialist tax treatment&mdash;a tax subsidy&mdash;just as it is now giving our international maritime industry a tax subsidy when, as has been pointed out in this place, some other people are probably far more deserving. I do not know that this is a good idea, and I do not think it addresses the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is that we have never created corporate structures for small and medium business. We have one corporate structure which is highly complex and extremely expensive&mdash;the costs of prospectuses and the legal challenges today&mdash;to get into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember once reading where a business that I thought was fairly attractive was to change hands for $300,000. There was a takeover bid&mdash;it was published in the paper&mdash;and I said to a friend, `Gosh, 300,000 bucks for that business. We ought to put in a bid for $350,000.' We rang up somebody who knew something about these processes. He said, `You'd have to create a part B statement.' I said, `Thanks for that. What would that cost me?' He said, `About $40,000.' I said, `What if they knock my bid back?' He said, `You will have done your 40 grand.' Being a person who has the odd interest in a racehorse, I did not think those odds were very attractive. But the shareholders missed out on a competing bidder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business must have a simple corporate structure&mdash;not the sort of things that the government is going on with. It seems to have a mental block about small business. It really does not understand. You can give small business quite a simple corporate structure that does not require a high degree of intervention. Models have been created by the company directors association and others, where you literally buy your little prospectus or your little lodgement form off the shelf in a stationers. I have always argued that the simple place to register it is not with the National Companies and Securities Commission in all its complexity; people should be able to register it at the Taxation Office. On the issue of a small business corporate tax file number, you are in business, and as long as you put a tax return in every year you continue to be in business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do you have to put in the second return? Why can the items relative to public disclosure not be available down there? When you do that, you do not need all these prop-up mechanisms and tax subsidies.

If we went back to the secondary board of the Australian Stock Market&mdash;shudder, shudder, because I know it had problems&mdash;and saw it recreated in a sensible way, we would give these people in relatively small or medium businesses a market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to express some views on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1994 as it relates to several tax concerns. The majority of the bill is devoted to amending the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. I say at the outset that some of these amendments are simply knee-jerk reactions to tax abuse which could be dealt with by closing those loopholes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, rather than take action to strengthen the breach, the government puts expediency before principle and uses the problems as an opportunity to increase its revenue base. By subterfuge and angling their amendments to achieve this aim, the government seriously damages the successful employee share acquisition scheme; thus denying Australian employees their entitlements to invest in their firms and share with employers the rewards of contribution, hard work and efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, under Labor taxation legislation has grown exponentially. The business community has been unnecessarily held back, burdened with needless red tape and compliance costs which have the effect of dampening new job opportunities. For the benefit of those sitting on the government benches, let me provide them with some disturbing statistics to illustrate my concern. In 1973, legislation relating to taxation consisted of some 560 pages. Today the maize of taxation legislation created by this government consists of more than 5,000 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation has become so complex that the High Court has had to publish a further 4,600 pages of rulings to explain the 5,000 pages of legislation. As a result, it is now a disgraceful fact that Australian businesses face a cost of more than $1 billion annually in complying with the government's legislative jungle of taxation. Such is the negative impact of the taxation maize imposed on small business by a Labor government that the Australian Commissioner of Taxation and the Small Business Coalition have had to establish a small business consultative group to address specific issues relating to the impact of current tax policy on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has just explained, this government seems to have no understanding whatsoever of the differentiation between small and large business. The government is very good at creating a dichotomy and a negative division between large and small industry, but it has not yet learnt to address the differences between those industries and the necessity of making legislation appropriate to the size of the business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major issues being addressed by this group set up by the Australian tax commissioner and the Small Business Coalition is the reduction of record keeping compliance costs associated with the Income Tax Assessment Act. It is evident from the amendments to this bill that the government is still up to its old tricks&mdash;increasing taxes on business to finance its own flawed policy agenda. It is ironic that the government has sought praise over its draft rewrite of the tax law dealing with substantiation and its proposal to include compliance cost impact statements with all tax law amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are aspects of this bill before the House today which have particular significance to small business. More specifically, the issues being dealt with in this bill are: first, the employee share acquisition scheme; secondly, the research and development activities; and, thirdly, the pooled development funds. The amendments relating to research and development activities and pooled development funds will benefit small to medium enterprise, but they are greatly overshadowed by the negative impact of changes to the employee share acquisition scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The business community's disappointment with the failure to date of the pooled development fund scheme fades into insignificance when compared with the disappointment and disillusionment associated with the government's amendment to the employee share acquisition scheme. These amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 subject employee share benefits provided to employees or their associates to fringe benefits tax. Employee share benefits arise from an employer providing employees with shares or rights to shares at a value less than their market value. The amount subject to FBT will be the difference between the amount paid and the market value. Where certain conditions are met, two concessional arrangements will apply in taxing those benefits: firstly, by providing FBT exemptions to employers for the first $500 of any discount; and, secondly, by allowing deferred income tax payments by employees on up to $1,000 in shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has two fundamental problems with these amendments. The first is that, whilst possibly preventing the use of employee share acquisition schemes to defer tax on remuneration, the amendments also impose tax on unearned income or unrealised gains. Secondly, rather than taxing the potential direct beneficiary, the employee, the new amendments propose to tax the employer or the sponsor by way of FBT. In other words, Labor is to impose a tax on those who receive no direct benefit from the scheme, a tax which is payable on income or gains which may never arise. To this extent, the new law is not only unwarranted but unfair, inequitable and contrary to long accepted principles of tax law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) recently quoted the former Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Ray Conwell, in an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on 12 November entitled `Tax madness kills incentive', as recently saying that the fringe benefits tax makes Australia the `laughing stock of our competitors' around the world. The member for Higgins summed up these comments perfectly when he said, `He's right. And after this little episode they'll be having hysterics.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considerable procrastination in finalising these amendments which has caused widespread confusion in the business community, the government's justification for imposing the FBT is that employers and employees could use the scheme to avoid paying pay-as-you-earn tax and to increase their income or remuneration. While some abuse has occurred, that has been acknowledged, and may have the potential to occur in the future, the fact is there has been no evidence of any wide scale abuse which warrants the heavy-handed action that the government is proposing. The big problem with these amendments is that they will diminish the employee share acquisition scheme as an option to encourage greater employee activity and participation in the ownership of enterprises in which they work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's approach is like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut. There are other ways to deal with tax abuses. The government could target the abuse with specific regulation to limit the amount of contributions for employee share acquisition schemes or impose a limit over which the scheme benefits could be deferred. Dr Vince FitzGerald in his report to the government on national savings suggested that any abuse of this scheme could be dealt with by new legislation to accompany section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Vince FitzGerald has also estimated that the employee share acquisition scheme could raise national savings by half of one per cent by the end of the decade. That is very significant in a country that has a very serious problem with its level of savings&mdash;or, should I say, its level of non-savings. His estimate is that by the end of the decade, through this particular scheme, we could have increased national savings of around $2 billion in today's terms. So it would make a significant contribution to the nation's savings. He goes on to say that this scheme could also increase annual tax revenue permanently by more than $500 million in the same time frame. So there would be an offsetting benefit to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that this government has an obsession, though, with the fringe benefits tax&mdash;and for good reasons, as far as it is concerned. Widening the FBT net to include employee share acquisition schemes will further boost government coffers, but at what cost to small business, at what cost to better management, at what cost to growth and investment and to employee and employer relationships?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax is one of the most costly taxes to comply with in Australia today. It is a nightmare for small business in particular. Revenue from FBT has jumped more than fivefold to $3.2 billion since its introduction in 1986-87, and the fringe benefits tax compliance costs for business may now be as much as 10 per cent of revenue. Extending the fringe benefits net to employee share ownership schemes will dampen the willingness of small business to increase participation in a scheme that can help solve Australia's savings deficiency; improve the harmony between employer and employee; motivate and reward an enterprising work force; increase Australia's ability to compete in the highly competitive local and global marketplace; and, through productivity gains and increased productivity, open up new jobs for unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the need to improve small business access to finance. The October edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin</EMPHASIS> clearly identifies the need for small business to have access to a wider range of financing options. The Reserve Bank data on lending to businesses by all banks indicated that small businesses account for $34.7 billion, or 49 per cent of the total of all variable and fixed interest rate borrowings. The Reserve Bank definition of lending to small business is classified as being amounts under $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector's borrowings of $21.4 billion were at interest rates in excess of 10 per cent as at June 1994. With recent rises in interest rates, this figure will increase again and will result in higher interest bills for small business. Almost $12 billion of the small business sector's borrowings were undertaken by the use of bank bills. Approximately $11.1 billion, or 93 per cent, of these bank bill borrowings were at interest rates in excess of seven per cent. By comparison, big business is able to access funds at lower rates, as indicated by the fact that $32.4 billion of bank bills accessed by big businesses are priced at interest rates less than seven per cent. A table from the Reserve Bank demonstrates that very clearly. In fact, big business is not only able to access its debt financing requirements at cheaper and more sustainable rates; it also has the added advantage of being able to access shareholders funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments outlined in this bill will deny small business similar financial advantages and management flexibility. This is yet another example of Labor's lack of basic understanding of the needs of this country's 757,000 small businesses. The position of Labor's discriminatory policies at work on small business was highlighted in the current edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> on 12 November. It shows that, of 15 major economies surveyed, Australian bank prime rates were the only ones with business rates in excess of 10 per cent per annum. Added to that rate, called the prime rate, is the bank's margin. So the 10 per cent or the excess of 10 per cent is not the price to the small business; that rate is increased by what is known as the bank's margin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So small businesses are forced to pay a crippling interest rate at this time. While other people are getting the benefits of the low rate, the people who can deliver to us an improved economic outlook and greater employment opportunities for all Australians are being penalised by having to pay excessive rates. Is it any wonder that so many of our nation's small business proprietors feel so defeated? Our national policies must begin immediately to reward and encourage innovation and partnership development between employers and employees. Our nation's prosperity and our social health depend upon it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of accessing finance is not new for small business. It is one of the major concerns of the small business owners in Australia. It was the focus of the small firm finance forum conducted by the National Small Business Centre earlier this year. Not surprisingly, the forum heard that accessing long-term finance is often impossible for small business owners who mostly finance long-term projects with short-term debt. Any of you who have been in business will know what that means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equity finance options were found by the small firm finance forum to be all but non-existent, leaving debt finance virtually the only option available to small enterprise. Unfortunately, financial institutions are reluctant to lend to new businesses without a proven track record or a large asset backing. While the pooled development funds have to date failed small enterprises, there has been great hope in the potential of the employee share acquisition scheme to provide much needed equity finance. That hope will be dashed unless the government changes the provisions of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continued development of the small business sector urgently requires initiatives that encourage innovation, investment and a competitive edge. Contributions made by employees to the employee share acquisition scheme would allow the enterprises to fund long-term projects with affordable long-term equity finance. Importantly, small business would be provided with previously non-existent security with an opportunity for business growth and resulting enhanced business management and promotion of employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employee share acquisition schemes encourage small enterprise management to concentrate on strategic development and business expansion, rather than on short-term financial survival. Importantly, they give employees a stake in the business that employs them. They foster the best practice by both employers and employees. They promote and encourage the development of partnerships based on ownership, trust and participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employee share acquisition scheme provides commitment for the benefit of employees. It provides the foundation for commitment within the enterprise that is required to maximise productivity. When launching the government's environmental statement on 21 December 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> was strength through partnership.

<PARA>But when it comes time to deliver on these statements, again the Prime Minister is found seriously wanting. Employee share acquisition schemes uphold the principles outlined by the Prime Minister. The coalition supports the development of partnerships between employers and employees. Clearly, these amendments indicate that the Prime Minister and his government have no commitment to the principles which he espoused in the One Nation statement. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Heart-stopping rhetoric. But what about delivering? What about some substance in those frequent statements that we hear in this place? The business community, industry groups, the ACTU and the coalition have all agreed that the employee share acquisition scheme represents a golden opportunity to transform workplaces and to provide the reform that the Prime Minister mentioned. But action speaks louder than words and, whilst the Prime Minister's words may sound good, his government's actions in relation to this scheme will do little to pool employer and employee creativity and energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourteen of Australia's largest companies have already given notice that the enactment of these amendments will spell a death knell to their existing employee share acquisition scheme arrangements. These companies include BHP, Lend Lease, Pacific Dunlop, CSR, Westpac, Cadbury Schweppes and TNT. They certainly do not come into the small business category, but I can assure you that there are small businesses in the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendments place in jeopardy the gains made to date&mdash;and for what? Callous increases in FBT revenue. The minor tax avoidance problems could be overcome in other ways. Not only will the coalition vote against this government's absurd proposal to extend FBT to the scheme, but also it will initiate a Senate inquiry to investigate the whole matter. If the government has any evidence of substantial abuse, it can present it to that inquiry, but there is no need to wipe out the whole provision of a perfectly good scheme under the notion that there is some kind of abuse or avoidance going on. For Australia's small business proprietors, the employee share acquisition schemes are a much needed alternative to debt financing options. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Employee share ownership plans are a way of turning workers into  shareholders; a way of turning employees into partners; a way of making society less unequal; a way of encouraging the spread of democratic capitalism&mdash;and, under this taxation bill, they are plans which the government is making almost impossible. This government has as its motto the biblical lamentation, `To those who have, more shall be given and to those who have not, even what little they have shall be taken away.' In this bill, the government is making it almost impossible for businesses to give their own workers more of a stake in the enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the employee share ownership plans workers get shares in the companies they work for at a beneficial price. At present the benefits provided under these employee share ownership plans are not taxed immediately in the hands of the employee; but, of course, the employee does pay income tax on any dividends from those shares and, if and when the employee comes to sell those shares, obviously capital gains tax is paid. Under the rules that this bill would implement, however, benefits worth more than $500, or benefits worth more than $1,500 that do not involve a deferred income tax liability, will incur fringe benefits tax. In other words, if the benefit is more than $500, or more than $1,500 in the case of a deferred income tax liability, these workers will have to pay fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amounts concerned are quite derisory. They are not large enough to allow workers to build up a meaningful stake in their companies in a reasonable space of time. To give you an idea of just how derisory these limits are, in countries such as the US, Britain and France, the sorts of limits that are imposed on employee share ownership plans are 10 times more generous than those under this government's bill. This government's bill means that, in order to give their employees one dollar worth of benefit, companies will have to pay $1.30 to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of this bill is that the extension of employee share ownership plans has been all but destroyed. Cadbury Schweppes, a very large company, has already wound up its existing scheme. Even though the annual general meetings of two major financial institutions, Westpac and St George, had approved such schemes and even though both had spent something in the order of $300,000 to put such schemes in place, those schemes will not be going ahead now that this government has proposed this bill. Qantas has similarly scrapped its plan for an employee share ownership scheme and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, formerly owned by this government, has had its plan put into place only because the government has agreed to give it a special exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that of the top 20 companies in Australia, 80 per cent have employee share ownership plans. Of the top 50 companies in this country, 75 per cent have employee share ownership plans. Of companies with these plans employing more than 1,000 people, 60 per cent of employees are covered by employee share ownership plans. Of companies with these plans employing between 100 and 1,000 people, 25 per cent of employees are covered. In other words, hundreds of thousands of Australian workers are currently covered by these plans. Indeed, it is estimated that up to $3 billion has been added to the savings pool of this nation under the existing tax regime thanks to these plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not let anyone tell you that these plans are a perk for the rich because, under the plans in place, as of 1991 $3,100 on average had gone to benefit executive staff but $2,400 on average had gone to benefit shop floor staff. These plans have been a way of breaking down the inequalities not only between workers and bosses generally, but between blue and white collar workers and between shop floor and mahogany row employees in our Australian companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go through some of the companies that have employee share ownership plans or which plan employee share ownership plans. It is a veritable cavalcade of the top companies in this country. It is a veritable who's who of business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these companies have employee share ownership plans and all of these plans are put at risk by this government's bill. In fact, if you believe what has been said by government speakers, every one of these companies is a tax cheat. What a slander on these great companies. In particular, I draw attention to two of those companies&mdash;the Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd, a former wholly owned company of the federal government, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, 50 per cent owned by the federal government. If all these companies with employee share ownership plans are tax cheats, the federal government, on its own words, is complicit in tax cheating. Isn't this ludicrous? And isn't the government's bill one that we could well do without?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing about this bill is that the government has even let down the ACTU. By bringing in this proposition to attack the ordinary form of employee share ownership plan, it has left plans based on negative gearing as the only form, or the most tax advantageous form, of employee share ownership plan. Those are plans that the ACTU has warned workers against and are plans which could actually end up leaving workers with significant debts, not significant assets. This is the result of this government's misguided plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, under the proposal of the federal government, an important vehicle for increasing national savings has been put at risk. Vince FitzGerald, an academic who is often commissioned by this government to do work on economic subjects, has estimated</PARA>
<PARA>that, under the old tax regime applying to employee share ownership plans, national savings could be increased by half a percentage point a year up to the year 2000&mdash;that is, $2 billion a year that could be added to our national savings pool under the old tax regime. That is $2 billion a year that is going to be sacrificed under the plan that this government has now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, FitzGerald estimates that, if the government were prepared to leave the old regime in place, it would gain $500 million a year more tax than under the proposal it has put before us in this bill. In other words, to get a little bit of short-term gain, this government is prepared to sacrifice a long-term benefit to itself, to taxpayers and to the whole Australian community. This bill is typical of the government's propensity to tax first and think later. That is what this bill demonstrates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also demonstrates a pedantic, treasury driven world view and a complete failure to address equity issues in our society. This bill&mdash;this attack on employee share ownership plans, this attack on democratic capitalism&mdash;is going to make society even more unequal. It is going to exacerbate the equity problems that this government has enshrined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government's policies, we already have a situation where 24 per cent of all Australian families have no-one with a job. Nearly one million children live in families where no-one has a job. We have a situation, thanks to this government, where nearly 2 1/2 million Australians are either unemployed or underemployed. We have a situation where, since 1983, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. We have a situation where the number of people living below the official poverty line is something like 14 per cent higher than in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two million people living under the official poverty line in Australia today, 300,000 more than in 1983. This bill to wipe out worker democracy and worker participation and this bill to entrench inequality in the workplace is just going to make the situation worse. The fact is that it is typical of this government to preserve privilege. It is preserving a situation where the rich get richer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cruel irony is that we have the richest Prime Minister in history presiding over a government which will not allow workers to get shares beneficially in their own companies. The Prime Minister can have his big house&mdash;his mansion, his palace&mdash;in Woollahra but workers cannot even have a few shares. The Prime Minister can have his lucrative piggery investment, which he has just sold at what is thought to be a massive profit, but workers cannot even have a few shares in their company. The Prime Minister can buy from and sell antiques to his mate Warren Anderson but workers cannot even be beneficially given a few shares in their own company. The Prime Minister can hobnob with the directors of the top 500 companies but those selfsame directors are no longer able to give a few shares to their own blue-collar staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with getting rich, but there is a lot wrong with people who get rich while keeping other people poor. The great flaw of the market economy is not inequality itself but entrenched inequality&mdash;the idea that property begets property and lack of property simply begets further lack of property. Marx was right to highlight the struggle between the haves and the have-nots, but he was wrong to assume that the solution was to abolish private property. The problem was not the existence of private property but the existence of gross disparity of private property and, hence, gross disparity of bargaining power and gross disparity of effective freedom. The solution was not to abolish private property but to ensure that all had reasonable access to private property of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what employee share ownership plans do&mdash;at least, that is what they did until the government proposed in this bill to take away their existing tax treatment and to subject them to the fringe benefits tax. Employee share ownership plans are a way of giving workers a stake in our society; they are a way of giving expression to that great Australian ideal of the fair go; and they are a way of enabling Jack and Jill to be as good as their masters by making them their own masters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that this flint-hearted government is yet again hurting its own constituency. Let us face it: this government has betrayed its light on the hill; it has betrayed Ben Chifley's great aspiration to work for the betterment of mankind&mdash;not just here but wherever we can lend a helping hand; and it has taken away the ability of companies to lend a helping hand to their own workers. Under governments up to 1983, the great achievement of Australian society has not been to implement democratic socialism&mdash;as the Labor Party once wanted to do&mdash;but to implement democratic capitalism. But, under this government, there has been a fair bit of capitalism&mdash;often capitalism of the worst sort&mdash;but precious little democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In proposing this bill, the government is saying to Australian workers, `If you are a wage slave today, a wage slave is what you will remain.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank goodness the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) just sat down, because putting up with bibble-babble like that really tests your patience. I started wondering whether the honourable member was talking about the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) and cognate bills before the House. He was talking about whether the government was making it easier for people to own shares. The answer is yes, we are making it easier for employees to own shares, but you would not know about it from having listened to the opposition member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been asked why we are bringing share benefits into the fringe benefits tax net. The simple answer is: because they are income. Under the present arrangements, the shares are not going to the workers, whom the previous speaker was talking about; in the main, the shares are going to executives. So all of the benefits are going to executives and, by and large, the workers out on the work floor get very little. But, through the proposals the government is bringing in, we are saying that firms have to offer these benefits to all employees. If they do that, then they get the benefits. The simple fact is this: the best way to make sure that employees share in the benefits of a company by owning shares in a company is to make sure that, where benefits are given, a company is required to extend those benefits to all employees and not just to a chosen few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debate we have also talked about compliance costs and about the employer having to pay the tax. I thought this had been argued and won back in 1986. It has been a longstanding arrangement that the employer, because he gives the benefit, collects the tax. That is clearly much more efficient. For instance, we have heard about the 50,000 employees. Imagine those 50,000 employees having to do the sums and provide the tax. It is clearly more efficient, if we are talking about compliance costs, for one employer to do that. That argument was won a long time ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the proposed measures are about fair play. What we are saying to employees is, `If you want concessional treatment for share benefits you have to provide them to all employees. If you wish to provide these benefits to a select few, then tax must be paid on the benefits as they would be on any other benefit.' An employee who gets an increase in salary of, say, $10 a week pays income tax on it. The government is not prepared to condone arrangements where share benefits worth millions of dollars are provided to top executives free of current taxation. The opposition wants to provide a tax break to the top few and is opposing the extension of these concessions to the ordinary workers. We are saying, `We will provide liberal tax concessions if you provide share benefits to all workers rather than just a select few.' I cannot reiterate that often enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that Coles Myer and BHP were each providing share benefits to around 50,000 workers under their share plans. The previous opposition speaker, the honourable member for Warringah, was shedding tears about the fact that these companies were scuttling these schemes. But what the opposition should know is that a company could under the proposed measures provide $500 of share benefits to each and every one of its employees absolutely free of tax&mdash;no fringe benefits tax, no income tax. What is more, the $500 worth of non-tax share benefits can be provided every year&mdash;not just once but every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the story does not end there. If a company issues shares at a discount to give each of its 50,000 employees share benefits of $500, it will get a deduction of $20 million in calculating its taxable income. That gives a saving of around $8 million in income tax. The government is offering to provide these tax benefits to companies that put in place genuine employee share schemes available to all employees. There is also the option, if you like, of a deferral concession of $1,500. That means that employees can defer tax on up to $1,500 of share benefits every year for between five and 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum to the bill states that the nature of this measure is such that a reliable estimate cannot be provided. The measures will have a significant impact in protecting the revenue against erosion through potential widespread abuse of the current provisions. They will stamp out this abuse and restrict the open-ended tax deferral advantages offered by existing share schemes. However, the measures will also involve a revenue cost depending on the number of companies that take advantage of the very liberal tax concessions proposed for genuine broad based employee share schemes. The government anticipates that, once the benefits of the new concessional arrangements are fully understood, a significant number of companies will take advantage of the concessions to provide share benefits to all of their employees. For many schemes only modest changes would be required for them to fit within the new concessions. Indeed, this is already beginning to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have none of the debate we hear from the opposition that the government is stopping employees from gaining shares in their own companies. We are making sure that more employees get these benefits, and doing it in a more efficient and fairer way. In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who participated in the debate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks to appropriate from consolidated revenue the sum of $676 million. This appropriation of $676 million is in addition to the amounts sought under Appropriation Bill (No. 1) which formed part of the budget presented to this parliament in May this year. This bill makes provision for additional funds across the board for government departments that have been required to meet salary increases and also general increases in running costs of departments which were not calculated at the time of the budget. There is also the impact of previously announced government initiatives. The total of these amounts is approximately $167 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence seeks an additional amount of $215 million for the following purposes. It seeks $186 million for equipment and stores. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), we were simply told that the need for this increase in funding was due to a carryover from 1993-94, provision for the payment of fuel excise and reprogramming of approved projects, together with a number of new equipment approvals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to see any supporting papers to indicate to me that these expenditures are necessary or that they have been properly costed. No doubt the minister will be able to provide the House with his assurance that he has examined all the relevant reports that would indicate that these sums are necessary to keep our defence forces at a required level of readiness. I strongly suggest that all the minister has done is to respond to the requests without giving them even a cursory glance&mdash;a trait that appears common in all of these requests for the use of additional taxpayers' funds. But more on that aspect later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine a few of these requests. A request of $13 million is made for defence facilities. We are told that the bulk of the requirement is due to a slippage from the 1993-94 upgrade of the sewerage system at Holsworthy. An examination of the portfolio overview for this program attributes the need for these additional funds to increased provisions for costs associated with the connection of Holsworthy to the New South Wales sewerage scheme. Perhaps the relevant minister would be able to make the choice as to which it is before the taxpayers are expected to foot the bill. At the same time, it may well be helpful if the minister at the table, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), gave us the courtesy of some explanation of the end use of these additional funds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who in previous times made an art form of not knowing what went on around her and sat idly by while Labor in Western Australia wasted a billion dollars, is on the same path of inadequacy in her current job. A claim has been made for an additional $11 million for corporate leadership and resource management services. They have explained this additional claim as an adjustment to the price calculation&mdash;or, in plain English, they got their sums wrong. The adjustment for legal services of $107,000 means, in plain English, `We miscalculated, Minister.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is typical of the way in which your mob, to borrow some of the eloquence of Placido the Great, continues its disjointed policies&mdash;policies that will inevitably lead to higher interest rates and a continued growth in the current account deficit. While on the subject of the ex-Premier of Western Australia, her colleague in the other place, who job shares with her, will probably bumble out an explanation for her management deficiencies. Under the program for child-care fee relief there is a request for an additional $34 million with explanations in the portfolio estimate statements such as `funds were higher than estimated', `adjustment to budget estimates' and `revision of projections'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is simply not good enough for the taxpayer. While the Labor Party appears more than happy to embrace these explanations, I must say that members of the opposition are appalled at the inadequacy of these explanations and at the cheek of those charged with the care of the taxpayers' dollars to come to this place and put their hand out for more funds to cover up their fiscal ineptitude. I could continue an examination of the items comprising the balance of this bill, but continued examples of where this government has failed to take prudent care of the taxpayers' dollar will be the only result of such an examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill we are examining today is the Appropriation Bill (No. 4). This bill is brought before the House to seek authority from this parliament for the appropriation of the sum of $399.214 million from consolidated revenue. The Minister for Finance, in his second reading speech, listed a number of items for which these appropriations are sought to cover. Amongst these payments are $11 million for drought relief payments and $10 million for the matching dollar for dollar contribution to the farmhand appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the request by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) for additional funds, we have an amount of $926,000 sought under the program management support and advice. I must take a moment to remind honourable members of the objectives of this program: high quality and timely support services and advice delivered efficiently and effectively to meet the program objectives and the needs of the minister and the departmental program management. It is when the incompetence of the minister comes to the fore&mdash;incompetence that wastes taxpayers' dollars&mdash;that this parliament has the right to be severely critical. Again, hamstrung by the lack of detail, we can only surmise how much of the additional claim for $926,000 has been as a direct result of an incompetent minister seeking expensive legal assistance to try to get himself off the hook from the myriad of inquiries that he will and should be facing. The taxpayers should not have to bear the financial burden of this minister's incompetence. The solution was simple. As suggested by my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), he should have resigned; then we could have saved a lot of money and a lot of embarrassment to the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the other programs identified as requiring additional expenditures are a number within the immigration and ethnic affairs portfolio. Something that I believe should test the tolerance of Australian taxpayers is the request, on top of an amount of $1.5 million, for a further $370,000 to cover projects that will celebrate events that will support the international year for tolerance activities. We are spending $1.5 million to work out how to spend $370,000. That should surely test the tolerance of anyone in respect of the fiscal negligence of this government. We shall watch with great interest the explanations that the minister gives in the Senate estimates hearings as to the financial rabbiting in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final bill to be examined is the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). An amount of $7 million is sought for the additional costs associated with the recurrent expenditures of this building. I have noted that, in the portfolio additional estimates, the Joint House Department and the Department of Finance have agreed to finalise their deliberations on funding requirements for future years in time for the budget deliberations that will take place in that area. That is a move that I laud both departments for. It is important that, if we are to be at all critical of ministers and departments for their use of additional estimates as another means of budgeting, we should get our own house in order. The items sought by this bill relate primarily to assets that require replacement. Again, I trust that the Joint House Department will be able to stick fairly rigidly to the five-year plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One aspect that does concern me is the tendency for members to allow others to use the facilities of this House that are provided for members' use by the taxpayers. Of course, I am referring to the matter raised last Thursday by the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) concerning the use of photocopiers in the hallways of this House by people who were camped outside the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I spoke in the House on appropriation bills No. 1 and No. 2 on 7 June this year, I made the point that I considered that the government's land fund represented a cynical attempt by the government to buy off yet another interest group, and further that we have already seen it do this with the environmental lobby groups, the sporting fraternity and women. This package of bills continues this cynical and unprincipled use of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the community, this government's targeting of particular interest groups is well recognised for what it is&mdash;vote buying at the taxpayers' expense. After being caught in the sport rorts affair, Placido the Great and his minders are now making an art form of it. Poor old Western Australia has been seen as a lost cause by the Prime Minister. We got rid of his mob; we even provided him with an ex-Premier to advise him of how high on the nose his mob in WA is. No thanks to her, I might add. The reward is that we are not part of this cynical targeting that took place in his so-called cultural policy. The hypocrisy of this government and of this man that leads it does not stop there. For those who are unfortunately the victims of the government's policies and have been unemployed for the long term, there are necessary measures to provide them with the assistance to return to the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The emperor&mdash;the person who gave us the recession that we had to have; who created, with a bit of help from his camp followers, over one million unemployed people&mdash;now comes seeking further taxpayers' funds to remedy the matters that were his doing in the first place. Government with responsible economic policies would not be involved in this continual hypocritical use of taxpayers' money. The emperor takes great pride in making pontifications for all the good works he sponsors. It is almost akin to Nero giving a subsidy for musical education to buy the arts vote and making announcements on fire prevention measures in the next breath. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These appropriation bills continue the big spending, high  deficit policies of the Labor government. It is these policies which will undermine our economic growth and induce yet another boom-bust cycle in the Australian economy. As an Australian, the most frustrating thing about this government's economic policy is the absolute refusal of the Prime Minister to learn from his past mistakes. It is not as though the Prime Minister has the weight of numbers on his side; he does not. His list of critics is long and distinguished, and includes the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Treasurer, Treasury, the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia and the majority of media commentators. But, no, the Prime Minister knows more about economic policy than all of them. He is the receptacle of divine insight into the economy and sees something that no-one else can see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one denies that fiscal policy has a role to play when the economy is struggling, as Australia was during the recession&mdash;that we did not have to have, I might add. But the time for that has passed. The economy is now growing, and it is time to pull back the deficit&mdash;to wind back the debt and consolidate the nation's accounts. Running such a large deficit during the great growth phase we are now in is economic vandalism. It runs up needless debt, places pressure on the current account and interest rates, and undermines the fight against inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to debt. The Commonwealth is already paying $7.3 billion in interest payments. That is not paying off capital, just interest obligations. By 1997-98, this will have risen to $9.5 billion. As a taxpayer, I would rather this money go into education, roads and health. The Labor government would rather give it to the financial markets. It now seems as though the Prime Minister is trying to do a Kirner and endlessly notch up debt until, in the end, government financial flexibility is severely restrained by the need to repay debt. The elected government cannot readily set its own priorities because the banks are taking a bigger and bigger share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Keating vision for Australia to have the Commonwealth government and taxpayers loaded down by debt? Failure to now reduce debt will see Australia go into the next downturn with a significant deficit and no buffer. If people believe that we will have an extended period of surplus to repay this debt, they are kidding themselves. By 1997-98, when we will still have a deficit of $2 billion, the economy will have been growing for seven years. If people think that, after seven years of growth, we will then have a period of further sustained growth to get the debt levels down, they are again kidding themselves. What will happen is we will go into the next downturn with high levels of Commonwealth debt already in place and we will add to an existing mountain of debt. The Keating legacy to Australia, both to this generation and to the next generation, is debt, debt and more debt. Of course, the government will say that I am talking down the recovery and our prospects. But I am not; I am simply facing the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of equal concern is the great restriction on Australia's economic growth&mdash;that is, the current account. Again the government is doing nothing to prepare Australia to deal with this current account blow-out. As the economy expands it is clear that there will be some deterioration in the current account, but not to the extent that we are seeing right now. The current account will not just overtake the government's forecast, it will blow it right out of the water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must play its role in increasing national savings and take pressure off the current account. It must do this by reining back the deficit. It will not do this; rather, it will just go on saying, as it has been doing to date, that everything is okay and we do not have to worry. It must be sadly ironic for those hundreds of thousands thrown out of work by government policies to now see the government sitting idly by allowing the current account to again grow beyond sustainable limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has acknowledged that both fiscal and monetary policy have to play a role in our economic recovery. At the moment, the full weight of dealing with inflation is going into higher interest rates. With demand growing strongly there is no reason for such a large deficit. All it is doing is fuelling inflation, increasing debt and undermining the current account. It should be wound back to help prolong the recovery. As alarm bells start to ring with growing intensity, what does this government&mdash;a government of words, not actions&mdash;have to say? Absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that this is the best set of figures for years and that we are on the verge of a golden era. This all sounds very familiar. It sounds like this is the one that will bring home the bacon. We have been in a golden age before, but it ended with one million people unemployed. The government ignored the warning signals then and it is ignoring them again. The current account is again spiralling out of control, interest rates are going up and the government is saying that everything is great and we have nothing to worry about. I am sorry, but things are not great. This government has not got it under control. We have a chance to consolidate this recovery, but you on the other side are blowing it, and for that you should hang your heads in shame.

<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, who do you think said those words? It was not Bernie Fraser, the Secretary to the Treasury or some of the financial management market analysts. The present Prime Minister said those words when he was the Treasurer in 1988. It is interesting. How soon we forget. The then great Treasurer in 1988 has forgotten the words he said then. Now he is too busy buying votes and racking up debt to worry about correct economic policy. He certainly knows what needs to be done, though. All we need to do is reflect on his statements of 1988. He simply lacks the backbone to do it, and the Australian people will pay for his weakness with lower growth and higher unemployment. The government will stand condemned for its weakness on this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take this opportunity during the appropriation debate to bring a very significant report, commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research, to the attention of the parliament. Martin Bell of the University of Queensland and Rick Carr from the Cairns Economic Research Unit of the James Cook University of North Queensland released their study of Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry last week. The subject of the report is very topical in Far North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry in Cairns and Far North Queensland is booming. The natural splendour of Far North Queensland is attracting domestic and international tourists in record numbers. The last decade has seen the tourism industry develop into one of Australia's key export dollar earning industries. In 1992 the tourism industry generated foreign exchange earnings of $8.2 billion. In 1991-92, the industry contributed about 5.5 per cent to GDP. The tourism industry provided 25 per cent of the gross regional product of the city of Cairns in 1992, according to the federal government's Industry Commission report on impediments to regional industry adjustment released in September 1983. In 1989-90, 18.7 per cent of international inbound passengers arriving in Queensland disembarked in Cairns. In 1980-81 it was only 3.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report prepared by the Queensland government's statistician, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism Statistics in Queensland</EMPHASIS> and commissioned by the Queensland Tourism and Travel Corporation, shows that Cairns stands alone as the flagship for inbound international tourism. The report shows that, since 1988, inbound international traffic to Cairns has climbed by 228.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the tourism industry in Far North Queensland is the result of a combination of factors, namely, appropriate government policy, the initiative and foresight of the local business community and substantial foreign investment, which, in the Far North, has come mainly from Japanese companies. In terms of government policy, I believe the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and World Heritage listing of the wet tropics rainforest by the federal government in 1988 have ensured that international tourists know about these two great tourist attractions. Just as importantly, this government has ensured that they are both preserved and properly managed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, Cairns got the lion's share of Queensland grants under the federal government's regional tourism development program in 1994. Over half the grants for the state came to the far north, including $158,000 to go towards the implementation of the Cairns regional tourism strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Far North Queensland Promotions Bureau has been a trailblazer in terms of regional tourism planning, and its current contribution to the Cairns regional tourism strategy is no exception. The strategy is comprehensive and addresses the interests of the many stakeholders in the Cairns tourism industry. The strategy recognises the need to preserve the integrity of the key tourism resources of the region&mdash;the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropics rainforests&mdash;in the interests of the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate the former manager of the FNQPB, Mr Geoff Donaghy, and its current manager, Mr Steve Noakes, for their success in driving the strategy. The Cairns business community has embraced the strategy with its characteristic enthusiasm and foresight. This community had the wisdom to recognise the critical role an international airport would have for the growth of tourism in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year is the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Cairns international airport. The decision to build the airport was visionary and has had a dramatic impact on the development of Far North Queensland. But it is not just the building of an airport terminal that has led to Cairns's success; it is the marketing of Cairns and Far North Queensland as a destination of both domestic and inbound tourists that has provided extraordinary growth in visitor numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairns business community got another pat on the back this year in the form of the McKinsey report. The report was commissioned by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) to survey business in regional areas. There is no doubt that Cairns came out the success story of the five regions that were reviewed. The study also looked at the experience of regions overseas and highlights the pivotal role of local leadership and shared vision in building regional investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns is geographically close to Asia. Cairns and Far North Queensland have always had close links with Asian countries. In the last decade, the Japanese, both as investors and visitors to the region, have been a large part of the impetus to growth in the Far North Queensland tourism industry. For example, the number of Japanese tourists visiting the Cairns region has grown from 2,000 in 1985 to 170,000 in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased Japanese visitor numbers have accounted for 42 per cent of the growth in international tourist numbers into the Cairns region. In fact, 33 per cent of all international visitors in 1992 to Far North Queensland were from Japan. Just as importantly, Daikyo is the largest single tourism investor throughout Queensland. In North Queensland, the company employs over 1,000 people. Japanese investors own 92.46 per cent of total foreign owned hotel rooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, therefore, that there is a big demand for Japanese speaking tour guides in the tourism industry in Cairns, which is where the thorny issue of immigration policy enters the debate. A report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tourism 2000: Key directions for human resource development</EMPHASIS> estimated that 1,200 Japanese speaking tour guides were employed in Australia at the end of 1991, up to 80 per cent of whom had temporary resident status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Japanese citizens are currently working in Cairns as tour guides or in other jobs in the tourism industry on temporary visas. Sectors of the tourism industry are in fact calling for the government to deregulate the temporary residents program to allow easier access to the Australian labour market for non-residents. There was previous controversy in 1992 when there was a push to import 2,100 Japanese tourist guides and the federal government refused entry. This led to the establishment of a Japanese language training course at Cairns TAFE. Training and proper accreditation must be a part of any future resolution of the problems that I will outline in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to put some tour operators' push for further deregulation of the government's temporary residents program into context, I will briefly outline the current rules. The government's temporary residents program is designed to facilitate the entry of people who will contribute to the social, cultural or economic development of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of principles that govern the entry of temporary residents. Employment must be available as a first priority to Australian citizens and permanent residents; the entry of temporary residents should not result in financial cost to the Australian community; except for top management and senior academic staff, temporary residents should eventually be replaced by people recruited and trained locally; persons with specialist skills and abilities should be admitted where this particularly enriches local talent and results in net employment benefit to Australian citizens and permanent residents; and employment conditions and remuneration of persons admitted for temporary residence must not be inferior to those of Australian citizens or residents doing comparable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working holiday-maker visas are also available to provide the opportunity for young people to holiday in Australia while supplementing their income through incidental work. The underlying objective is to enhance international relations by promoting cultural understanding on the part of both the applicant and local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at June 1993, Australia had reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan. Young people between 18 and 31 years from these countries can enter Australia and stay for a maximum of 12 months. The conditions that apply to working holiday visas are: the main reason for entering Australia is to holiday and any employment is incidental to that purpose; the applicant has a reasonable prospect of gaining full employment in Australia; the applicant has sufficient funds for personal support; and the applicant is only permitted to work for any one employer or in any one location for a maximum of three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received a number of complaints from Australian residents about these guidelines being breached in spirit, if not indeed in law. Just on anecdotal evidence alone, it is hard to accept that many of the tour guides from Japan came here on holiday and that their employment was incidental. In other words, it is hard to accept that many are not selected for positions before they leave Japan. When they get to Australia it has been suggested to me that some&mdash;I emphasise `some'&mdash;tourist operators are prepared to bend, if not break, the rules to keep them in jobs for longer than three months. I will read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from a constituent, an Australian Japanese speaking guide in the tourism industry, who has requested anonymity because of fear of victimisation. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, there can be a major company (who may be a wholesaler of inbound tours) who for the sake of our example we will call COMPANY (A). Most of the larger companies occasionally use . . . smaller guide companies. Such companies are very keen to please the much larger COMPANY (A) as they are usually a good source of work/income for them. We will call these companies (B), (C) and (D). These companies also use Japanese working/ holiday visa guides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A co-operative is formed in which company (A)'s guides will in theory be paid by company (B), after their first 3 months is over, company (C), after 6 months etc. However in reality, the people concerned are always working for the original Company (A), but records will officially show that they have changed employers. Of course this arrangement is reciprocal, so all companies involved can theoretically keep their staff for the maximum of 12 months that their visas allows them to stay in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After this 1 year period many of the workers apply for working visas, under the sponsorship of the companies. It can take between 3mths-8mths for an application to be processed. In the mean time the visa holders concerned are able to work. Many receive their working visas which allows them to stay for a further 2 years. If they are in a relationship, (of which the majority are after 1 year) they can sponsor their boyfriend/girlfriend as a defacto, allowing them to stay and work also.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major problem for Australians, is that guides staying longer than 3 mths are being trained to do the more illustrious jobs, when they wouldn't otherwise be trained if they were only staying 3 months. If the 3 month stipulation was adhered to, companies would actively seek out Australian residents to work for them as they would not require retraining every 3mths, and would be trained to handle the more sophisticated jobs leaving the more menial jobs to the working/holiday visa guides. This I feel would be more in line with the spirit of the working/holiday visa program, ie; they are used to plug the gaps in the work-force that Australian residents can't fill, and not squeezing Australian residents out of the gap and blocking entry to it (for newcomers to the industry ie; school-leavers, graduates etc), which is the current status-quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases quite serious stand-over tactics are used, giving small operators (who are dependent on work from the larger companies) no option but to co-operate. These small operators can be one man operations (Australian) who basically risk their livelihood, and consequently feel they have no choose but to cower to the demands of Company (A).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you require more information, or specifics please feel free to contact me. I appreciate your time and confidentiality.</PARA>
<PARA>A serious allegation has been made in that letter. It must be emphasised that we are talking about only a part of the tourism industry in Far North Queensland. Many operators go out of their way to employ Australians as tour guides and most do not flout the rules. These concerns make the subject matter of the report into Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry that I referred to earlier very timely. The report found that working holiday-makers were the largest single visa class in Australia as temporary residents. As of July 1993, there were 4,368 Japanese working holiday-makers in Australia. The report notes that, while not all of those were necessarily working at any one time, they represent a substantial potential addition to the Japanese born work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report found that some employers surveyed preferred Japanese tour guides because they were more culturally sensitive and ultimately brought more money into the business. However, other employers preferred Australian resident tour guides because their Japanese clients wanted contact with real Australians. This debate will continue to bubble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is the possibility that there are suitably qualified Australian resident Japanese tour guides who are unemployed or underemployed in a casual industry. I have assisted in forwarding all allegations of rule breaking to the immigration department in Cairns. As I understand it, the department is currently investigating a number of complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cairns has a mutually beneficial relationship with Japanese foreign investors and Japanese tourists; however, it is not acceptable for some Australian citizens to miss out on job opportunities because some&mdash;I stress some&mdash;tourist operators are rorting the immigration rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finish my speech by reading the last few paragraphs of the executive summary of the Bell and Carr report into Japanese temporary residents in the Cairns tourism industry. It accurately sets out the current issues facing the government and tourism industry in this regard. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although access to temporary residents has been an important element in the growth and development of the Cairns tourism industry, the skill profile of Japanese temporary residents sits uncomfortably with the ostensible goals of Australia's skilled temporary residents program. Certain groups of Japanese, such as clerks, tour guides, and sales and service workers, appear to be in relatively low-skilled occupations which border on being contract labour rather than professional transients. Even in the case of Managers and administrators, it appears doubtful that the roles performed by this group meet the expectations set down for the Executive class of temporary residents. There is also some evidence of exploitation of the system in the form of pre-arranged itineraries for working holiday-makers. Moreover, it is apparent that once granted entry, temporary residents tend to become part of the pool of available labour, moving relatively freely between employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems reflect the progressive shift that has occurred in Australia's temporary residents program towards liberalisation of labour market testing, and reduction of skill requirements in the interests of promoting economic development. The burden of contemporary opinion is towards further liberalisation of the rules to open up the Australian labour market to overseas competition, matching similar moves with respect to lowering of tariffs on commodities and opening up of financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long term, such liberalisation may confer significant benefits. However, the formulation and implementation of migration law in this field is ultimately a delicate balance between furthering economic development and ensuring that Australian residents are not disadvantaged. The difficulties involved are heightened by the concentrated impacts of temporary residents on specific occupations, industries and regions, as this particular case study serves to demonstrate. This report argues that until a great deal more is understood about the dynamics and impacts of the temporary residents program, particularly in localised contexts, such calls for further liberalisation of labour markets are premature.</PARA>
<PARA>In my view, this appears to be an understatement. Whilst I welcome cultural exchange, it must not be at the expense of jobs that Australians can perform. This is not the intent of either working holiday visas or temporary resident visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future, the tourism industry should work with the employees, their representatives and government to provide training and career paths.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and cognate bills demonstrate that the 1994-95 budget has yet again failed to provide the required financial responsibility or commonsense in the management of Australia's finances. When the federal government brought down its budget in May, Australia needed it to initiate a program of budgetary reform to restore a promise of balance to the nation's finances. Instead, Labor has shamelessly given us its 1994-95 budget with more of the same old recipe that sent Australia into the worse recession since the Great Depression, a recession from which many are still recovering. This was a budget of missed opportunities. More ominously, it was a budget from a government that has become not only complacent but downright irresponsible in power; a government that is starting to believe its own flawed political rhetoric.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeatedly in this House, we have heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) speak of his government as one of renewal and innovation. Let me categorically say that there is nothing new, let alone innovative, with Labor's destructive approach to economic management. Rather than adopting responsible policies in the current upturn, Labor chooses to adopt a loose fiscal approach, again subjecting Australians to another one of its economic and fiscal gambles. It is a gamble in which the Prime Minister is using the hopes and aspirations of all Australians as his betting chips in a game where the odds are overwhelmingly stacked against our entire population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is betting that the present recovery will turn into the longest economic expansion in Australia's recorded economic history and will painlessly solve all of its deep-rooted fiscal problems. But the very real risk of the government's gamble is that everything will not go as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) hope; that the recovery will peter out sooner than they believe and that the government will condemn the country to going into the next economic downturn with a substantial budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate the reality of the scenario, the 1994-95 budget assumes a rise in business investment of 14.5 per cent. Business investment needs to sustain a record annual growth of 10 per cent for the next five years if Australian output is to grow by an average of four to five per cent a year for the rest of the decade. Unfortunately for Australia, history is not on Labor's side. It is merely a pious hope. History tells us that, in the past 25 years, Australian business investment has not been able to achieve double digit growth for two consecutive years, let alone over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, in order to sustain output growth of four to five per cent this decade, we need business investment to rise by double digits for the next six years. In investment terms, the government needs a miracle. The reality is that Labor has burdened our economic recovery with a fiscal policy that has added, and will continue to add, unnecessarily to the current account deficit and, as a consequence, to our already enormous foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sitting opposite would no doubt spout their usual rhetoric and argue that our economic prospects seem to be glowing. To quote Mandy Rice-Davies from the Profumo spy scandal affair, `They would say that, wouldn't they?' After all, they would say growth has improved, there has been little officially recorded inflation and it seems likely that the budget forecast of 4.5 per cent for the fiscal year 1994-95 will be met. I for one am not convinced by its polish. When one looks under the surface, the economic reality is far from glowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History shows that somewhere down the track, sooner rather than later, there will be an unpredicted shock: the business cycle will simply reassert itself and the economy will slide. If the budget deficit has not been reduced fast enough or far enough during the present upswing, our scope to counter any downturn by loosening fiscal policy will be much more limited than in the 1990s, leaving the all too familiar prospect of a return to even higher unemployment levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns are not without foundation. There are fundamental signs in the economy that I and many others regard as disturbing. The message that all is not well is becoming increasingly evident right across the broad spectrum of economic and social indicators. There is no doubt that this government is ignoring these signs in pursuit of a policy agenda that not only is jeopardising our economic recovery but is sure to spell disaster for Australia's longer term economic prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those sitting on the government benches opposite, I will provide some disturbing facts that illustrate my concerns. Despite the government's claims, unemployment is still a major economic and social problem in this country. It is the main cause of family breakdown, poverty and crime, and it represents a major underuse of our resources. It is also a drain on the budget. Even without including the masses of people who are conveniently left out of unemployment statistics, there are still some 800,000 people&mdash;or 9.1 per cent of our work force&mdash;out of work. But the real picture is much worse. Underemployment is a real factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government doing to solve our unemployment problems? Is it tightening fiscal policy and reducing the budget deficit? Is it stimulating investment and micro-economic reform? Is it fostering lasting growth in the economy? The answer to each of those questions is clearly: no, it is not doing any of these things. It is continuing its wasteful practice of throwing money into mostly pointless and often unaccountable training programs. Indeed, one of the appropriations in these bills currently being debated proposes to throw another $30 million of taxpayers' money into this bottomless pit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality of the situation is that such schemes do little more than improve official unemployment statistics by temporarily taking the long-term unemployed out of the unemployment equation. Even the participants would agree that these programs offer little to improve their employment prospects. Expressing concern for the unemployed on face value is easy, but we should begin to judge by actions and not by words alone. Formulating efficient, effective and equitable policies to permanently reduce the numbers of unemployed&mdash;particularly long-term unemployed&mdash;is much more difficult and requires more than just throwing money at the problems, as this government has become accustomed to doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about our foreign debt? Australia still has a massive debt problem. Our net foreign debt is currently around $160 billion and our gross foreign debt is in the order of $200 billion. Net foreign debt has grown around sevenfold in the last decade of Labor's regime, and will continue to expand rapidly as investment spending accelerates and as our call on foreign savings to finance investment increases. Labor's unacceptable build-up of foreign debt is making our economy vulnerable to swings in investor confidence and is compromising what is left of our economic independence. At a time when state governments are adopting a responsible approach to economic management by bringing their levels of debt under control, the level of Commonwealth debt is continuing to rise at an alarming rate. Federal government debt alone threatens to rise to an outrageous $90 billion in the very short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, our current account deficit is expanding at an alarming rate, particularly given that the investment pick-up has barely begun. In fact, Australia's whole set of national accounts is disgraceful. The September current account deficit was $1.8 billion in seasonally adjusted terms. That followed the August deficit of $2.2 billion and the July deficit of $1.7 billion. At this rate, Australia will record a deficit in 1994-95 of around $22 billion, or 4.9 per cent of GDP, which will exceed the government's own budget forecast of $18 billion, or four per cent of GDP, by a massive $3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government continues to carry on about keeping interest rates low in the wake of the recession, yet we have already seen official interest rates rise and pressure on them to rise again. No matter what Labor's rhetoric would suggest, interest rates in Australia are extremely high by international standards. Australia has close to the highest real interest rates in the developed world. The OECD predicts that by 1995, that is next year, Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates in the OECD. Furthermore, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine shows that Australia has the highest prime lending rate of all the OECD countries surveyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The signs continue to get worse. Our current level of savings is close to the lowest as a proportion of GDP that we have experienced since the Second World War. This and accumulated government budget spending are the main causes of our balance of payment problems. Alarmingly, the level of gross savings, which measures private and public consumption of fixed capital as saving, is only about 16 per cent of gross domestic product. It is substantially less than is needed to finance the level of investment demand required to sustain an economic recovery without overheating the economy and the attendant risk of sending us back into recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Implicit in our savings woes is the doubt hanging over our ability to sustain adequate levels of investment. While our investment levels have been very low for a long time, business investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is close to reaching its lowest level in 40 years. There are some indications of investment picking up but this is yet to be confirmed. However, even 14.5 per cent, as predicted in the  budget, is not all that good coming off such a low base. Australia suffers from serious structural flaws in its economy, such as high interest rates and a highly centralised industrial relations system, which pose long-term barriers to investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) rants and raves and boasts about his industrial relations reforms but the fact remains that nothing of any substance has been achieved. We are told that there are over 2,000 enterprise agreements but most of them are identical, having been inflicted by unions on employers, snared in a net with no alternative, nowhere else to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the incompetence of the Minister for Industrial Relations, the situation in many circumstances has become substantially worse. One need look no further than the ANL saga. The government has capitulated to the demands of its union mates, regardless of the damage this will do to industrial relations reform and to competition in this country. And the government's incompetence does not stop there. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill (No. 2), which we debated in the House earlier this week, not only highlights just how weak the minister is in implementing real industrial relations reform but also provides a classic example of the extremes to which this government is prepared to go to appease its union mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other worrying signs. In particular, there is concern over the possible consequences of emerging wage pressures. Mr Bernie Fraser, Governor of the Reserve Bank of  Australia, in his talk to the 23rd conference of economists commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A free-for-all in wage and price setting, which threatened a major breakout in inflation, would be countered by much larger increases in interest rates, notwithstanding possible consequences for activity and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we see in the light of Mr Fraser's remarks? Just this week we have learnt that the Transport Workers Union is once again bent on holding the country to ransom with demands for wage increases over 15 per cent that carry with them the strong possibility of industrial unrest and a national strike, on top of the inflationary impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no misunderstanding here: the large wage increases being pursued by the powerful unions have the potential to seriously undermine any sustained economic recovery. The undeniable fact of the matter is that, until we achieve real workplace reform, Australia will never be able to compete on an even footing in world markets. There is no doubt that the reform to which I am referring will never be achieved by a government, such as the current Labor government, which is only too happy to jump into bed with its union mates, regardless of the consequences of such action for the wellbeing of this country. Despite the rhetoric of the Prime Minister and other ministers, the fact remains that Australia still faces substantial immediate and longer term economic problems. As much as the government is trying to obfuscate and hide it, I am not the only one who recognises this fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">BIS Shrapnel has recently released its long-term forecasting report which shows that Australia is still very much caught in a boom and bust cycle. The report forecasts that the economy will falter in 1996-97 with interest rates and inflation rising, a blow-out in the current account deficit and growth reduced to less than one per cent. The report stresses the long-term damage that the period of low investment growth since the last recession has done to the economy. The report aptly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The seeds of the next downturn have already been sown by the failure of the federal government to induce sufficient investment in the recovery stage of the business cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>Access Economics similarly issued a warning over the medium-term economic outlook in its October publication of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economics Monitor</EMPHASIS>. The report said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's medium-term policy focus has been thrown off course by the sharp rise in global long bond yields and the rapid deterioration in Australia's current account deficit.</PARA>
<PARA>That report maintains that the government's unwillingness to adjust its loose fiscal policy means that there will be a rapid run-up in short-term interest rates which will impact quickly on cash flows. The fact is that Australia is now facing international competition which is stronger than ever before. In the face of this competition, we have the option of either making a concerted effort to improve our economic performance, which means tightening fiscal policy to reduce deficit spending, or continuing to go down the path of acute cyclical ups and downs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the depths of the recession of its own making, Labor has had to make a choice: it could have seen strong growth as an opportunity to tighten its economic and fiscal policy and implement faster structural and micro-economic reform within the economy or it could have become complacent and decided that the best policy would be to continue down the same old course and not rock the boat before the next election. Sadly for Australia, Labor has quite clearly opted for the latter, easier option. By choosing not to rock the boat with an election in mind, Labor has well and truly missed the boat. Australia is suffering a government that has run out of steam when it comes to implementing reforms needed to secure economic prosperity, a government that has run out of ideas and a government that Australians will have every reason to vote out of office at the first opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), I would like to remark on an issue of very great importance to me and a number of my colleagues from Queensland, and that is the issue of the allocation of tertiary places. The issue goes to the very heart of this government's commitment to the fundamental importance of the principles of fairness and equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, being the excellent Queensland member that you are, there is a funding disparity in the allocation of higher education places in Queensland as opposed to other parts of Australia. Despite the ugly head of parochialism which has arisen in some sections of the Victorian and South Australian academic and political community&mdash;I will comment on that later&mdash;it is easy to establish that Queensland is underresourced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, 17.6 per cent of the national population lives in Queensland. That share is growing year by year as more Australians realise the error of their ways and move from the rust-belt states of South Australia and Victoria to the sun-belt state of Queensland. However, despite having 17.6 per cent of the national population, Queensland is currently receiving only 16.6 per cent of Australia's university places. On the other hand, 25.3 per cent of the population lives in Victoria&mdash;and that percentage is going down&mdash;and Victoria has 27.1 per cent of tertiary places. That amounts to an overallocation to Victoria of more than 10,000 tertiary places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1974, when the federal government assumed responsibility for fully funding tertiary places, the number of publicly funded places in Queensland has always been under the national average. Queensland also has the second highest retention rate of school students to year 12. At 82.9 per cent, it is the second highest rate of all Australian states, and yet only 48 per cent of year 12 students gained admission to higher education courses in the following year. The overall effect of these statistics is that Queensland continues to have a level of tertiary qualifications significantly lower than the Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland is experiencing an economic growth rate of 6.5 per cent, with an increase of 100,000 jobs in the past four years. The state needs tertiary qualified and highly skilled people in its work force. The issue is not about the expansion of Australia's tertiary education system through greater funding of under-represented states such as Queensland; the issue is about the reallocation of existing resources within the system to achieve fairness and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year, the joint working party of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Higher Education Council made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly no overall demographic imperative for further immediate publicly funded expansion of the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that the Australian population will increase by over three million between now and the year 2011, there will be an absolute decline in the population in the age cohorts from which higher education participants are predominantly drawn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the places already allocated to the higher education system will allow substantial growth in age participation rates into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA>The discussion paper went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Party is strongly of the view that the Commonwealth must take action to ensure that imbalances in the supply of Commonwealth resources for higher education between States and Territories are not exacerbated.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. Since 1990, my federal Labor colleagues from Queensland and I have been extremely active in our campaign to improve Queensland's share of tertiary places. Our constant lobbying for places has seen the total number of undergraduate student places grow from 52,090 in 1990 to 69,460 in 1995. That has been a substantial achievement. However, it is regrettable that Queensland will still be over 4,000 student places short at the start of the 1997 academic year if the current ratio of distribution of places across Australia is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this inequity is not confined to Queensland. Universities in western Sydney, northern New South Wales and Western Australia are also significantly disadvantaged by the current distribution of places. Because of this fact, over 30 federal Labor members of this parliament from those areas&mdash;western Sydney, northern New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland&mdash;have joined together to form the Fair Share Task Force to fight these distribution inequities in our higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are continuing the hard work on behalf of the families in our electorates who have suffered in the past, and we are continuing to work on behalf of students in all of our electorates to gain a fair share of tertiary places. We have been having regular meetings with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean), whose door has been always open to us and who has listened to us in a very positive way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As convenor of the Fair Share Task Force, I would like to reaffirm our support for the education policies and programs of this government, which have witnessed record retention rates for secondary school students to year 12. Nearly eight out of 10 young people now complete their final year, compared to less than half that figure in 1982, and in 1993 there were nearly 90,000 more tertiary commencements than a decade earlier, with an increase in Commonwealth funding of higher education of over 50 per cent for the same period to a figure now of $4.6 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are substantial achievements by this government and show our commitment as a government to higher education. Successive federal Labor education ministers have very effectively restructured the Australian higher education sector to make it a relevant and competitive sector of the Australian economy. Our Fair Share Task Force supports the contributions of the current Minister for Employment, Education and Training and acknowledges his commitment to redress the imbalance in student places suffered in states like Queensland and Western Australia and, of course, in most parts of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DEET Higher Education Council working party identified three categories of options which the federal government could adopt to redress the imbalance of places. These were, firstly, the redistribution of some proportion of existing places currently available to the higher education system; secondly, the funding of additional student places from within the resources currently allocated to the sector, either through the use of an efficiency levy, the redirection of existing postgraduate subsidies or utilisation of non-operating grant funds; and, thirdly, the funding of growth through the utilisation of private resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first option is one that will provide the long-term benefits to redress the imbalance for Queensland students. I agree that there is no further need to expand the tertiary sector with an additional injection of funds, but I do believe that justice for Queensland has to come through the redistribution of existing places currently available in the system. This should involve Victoria and South Australia conceding some of their higher education positions to Queensland, Western Australia and parts of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do call on the government to initiate action to create some additional student places for 1996. It is clear that we are not able to take action at this point to provide places for 1995, because funding commitments have already been made and institutions have already made decisions based on that allocation of funds that had been determined previously. But there is some scope for us to address this issue in 1996, and with the renegotiation of the triennium period that starts in 1997 a redistribution should definitely occur from that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fixing-up for 1996 should be done by using the discretionary funds such as the quality assurance money, which was one of the options discussed in the DEET Higher Education Council working party discussion paper. It said in that paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Quality fund was seen by a majority to have served a useful purpose, and to have generated much positive change. But it was also argued that it may be desirable to amend the existing Quality process in the future, especially noting that an annual recurring cycle after the first two or three years may be of increasingly marginal benefit. Therefore a less frequent cycle of Quality funding could be contemplated, freeing up some funds for additional places.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is clear that the expert committee that the government established to review this whole question backs up our claims that in 1996 we should get access to some of that quality assurance money, because the higher priority is funding of places to those areas which have been significantly disadvantaged until now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1996, $75 million has been set aside for the quality fund, to be used at the discretion of the minister on the recommendations of the quality committee. On behalf of my colleagues in the Fair Share Task Force, I call on the minister to use a proportion of these funds to allow more Queenslanders and students from those other disadvantaged states who are unable to gain tertiary admission a chance to come in from the cold. Quality assurance funds should be used to fund additional growth places in these institutions in 1996. That will be a short-term solution for 1996, but a long-range problem will require substantial renegotiation of the triennium funding for universities, and decisive action will be required by the government to address those longer-term needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the commitment of increasing places in this funding triennium and the expectation of considerably more places for Queensland at the start of the new triennium in 1997, it is important that we take action as soon as we can. That will require decisions next year to reallocate the quality assurance money so that in 1996 some of those funds can be used to purchase additional places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, on all of the mainstream indicators for higher education resource allocation&mdash;age profile of the population, retention to year 12, sustained demand for higher education, economic growth, graduate employment and distribution of employment across the various industry groups&mdash;Queensland has an established case for a fair share of higher education opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thankfully, this case is recognised by the current federal Minister for Employment, Education and Training, who has stated his position on several occasions. Members of the Fair Share Task Force realise that we have the support of the minister, and we appreciate that support. We also realise that the budgetary demands under his responsibility do not allow him to take any financial decisions for next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than sensationalising this emotive issue of access to education, it is our aim and desire to see this imbalance rectified fairly, constructively and with a high degree of financial responsibility. Unfortunately, some states are openly hostile towards achieving fundamental equality in the distribution of tertiary places. Not surprisingly, this attitude comes from some elements of the academic and political communities in Victoria and South Australia, the two states which at the moment are enjoying an unnaturally high number of tertiary places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 November this year, the Minister for Employment, Training and Further Education in South Australia, Mr Bob Such, wrote to his state's senators urging them to reject moves towards making our higher education system fairer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State Government has joined with the three SA universities to reject the unsubstantiated and illogical notion that distribution of growth in the higher education system should be juggled in the ways being considered by the DEET-Higher Education Council.</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now understand that 31 Labor MPs from the so-called `growth states'. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The figures clearly show that we are the growth states and that we have received some backing from our federal Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who is a Queenslander and who recognises the disparity that is occurring. Mr Such continued, in his ill-conceived manner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be outrageous if Federal Cabinet was to accept the notion that university places should be taken from some States and given to others purely on the basis of an outmoded State/Territory borders mentality.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a rather amazing comment coming from a state that often espouses states rights and accuses the Commonwealth of interfering with the rights of states. Yet when we actually seek to have some redress in the imbalances that have occurred he says, `You should not use states as the boundary for determining whether or not people should get funds.' He is saying it is okay to discriminate positively in favour of South Australia and Victoria; it does not matter if students in northern New South Wales or western Sydney or Queensland or Western Australia continue to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an illogical attitude he has. His parochialism is clearly unhealthy and unfitting of a man of his stature in the national political system. I am sure that his attitude would surprise many people, particularly his Liberal Party colleagues in South Australia and throughout the rest of Australia who have always espoused very strongly the notion of states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also register my extreme disappointment at some of the statements emanating from sections of the Victorian academic community. When they realised that their stranglehold on teaching and student places was under threat, people such as the Vice-Chancellor of Monash University, Professor Mal Logan, had the hide to describe Queensland as an academic backwater. Comments like that do not help the debate. They display an arrogance and a culturally superior attitude which are similar to those of Mr Such from South Australia. I can only conclude that this is the result of being continually given a silver spoon when it comes to higher education places. Their rhetoric may continue to flow but, on the hard evidence that we have put forward in this House today, their case does not measure up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following research conducted by my colleague the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), we can also identify further silent discrimination against many of the newer tertiary institutions in growth states such as Queensland, as well as against the University of Western Sydney, which is in the electorate of the member for Werriwa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the University of Queensland, which was founded in the early decades of this century, most of the higher education institutions in Queensland and in these new growth areas are still in relatively early stages of development. In this respect, they lack the considerable networking power of the older, established universities, which receive considerable sums in endowments and private donations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, universities in Victoria received over $48 million in private funding, as opposed to just over $8 million for the Queensland tertiary sector. Whilst no-one should begrudge the Victorian institutions this significant advantage, it is a factor that needs to be highlighted.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about retrospectivity; we are going back to a former time when that was the case. The situation here is very simple: when an employer contributes superannuation for an employee, he gets a tax deduction for it. If too much superannuation is put into a fund and money is paid back to a company, we expect that to be assessable, because we have already given a deduction for it. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a fairly simple concept; it has been around for a long time. In fact, the relevant provision in this case has been there since 1964 and is fairly well understood.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are saying that they should not be tax free. In cases like that, where the intent of the law is clear and there is an arrangement in place that seeks to get around that law, of course the government is going to use retrospective legislation to protect the revenue. Any competent government would do the same. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) condemns himself out of his own mouth. He quite rightly says that the law has been around for a long time. But, apparently, the law was not around on 1 July 1988, because that is when the measure is to take effect from. So, clearly, the law to deal with the problem has not been around. Whose fault is that? It is not the fault of the people in the wider community acting in accordance with the law as it is written; it is the fault of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>

But to penalise people who have been acting in accordance with the letter of the law for six years in the way that is now proposed is unconscionable, and that is the situation we invariably get into. It was a fault with the drafting of the law but, if it has been a problem for six years, when was it first picked up and why was it not picked up earlier?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not just talking about retrospectivity; we are talking about six years. Apparently in that time the law has not been adequate to meet what the minister now says has been always intended. The government has not got a very good policing system if this has been allowed to go for so long. Sure, there might be some smart alecs out there who have regarded the situation that prevails as a loophole, something to be taken advantage of in their tax planning and tax minimisation schemes. But there are other people who are acting innocently, and it does not matter whether they knew or did not know what the government's intention was. Neither should be penalised in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his second reading contribution, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) indicated that there is no way the coalition can support the measure involving employee purchasing schemes, and he went into his reasons at great length. Since then, many speakers on this side have canvassed our reasons, and the point is well made. If by weight of numbers the House carries this measure, we will seek to have this schedule of the bill referred to a Senate committee to investigate the various options of closing down any real or potential abuses in the current operation of these schemes, but without destroying them through the imposition of a fringe benefits tax, as is now proposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Taxation Institute elected to note in its response to this schedule that, if the underlying policy of the government is to encourage longer-term share ownership by employees, particularly those with lower incomes, then what is proposed is, in the words of the ATI, suboptimal. That is a nice way of putting it, I suppose. The reasons given are that, if the employee is to be taxed in the case of the deferral concession of ESASs, there will be an additional taxing point at the time the restrictions on the shares cease&mdash;usually within five years of issue&mdash;when the employee is taxed on the amount of deferral concession, plus any increase in the market value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shares are to be provided to the employee rather than leaving the tax point solely when the shares are actually sold. When they are actually sold, of course, capital gains provisions apply. Unfortunately, in the material we have been provided with, there is no explanation of this feature. This is a point to be added to those which have already been made in debate. The opposition is strenuously opposed to this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this time of the year the appropriation bills are a routine activity of this parliament. It is the time when the government, having run its budget to this point, clears up its final appropriations to conclude the financial year. Most of the matters, totalling some $676 million, are matters that will be dealt with separately later in terms of the specific outlays. Certain frontbenchers have already been briefed by departments on the purpose of these affairs. I note with interest that some $100,590,000 has been allocated for veterans' affairs, which happens to be one of my responsibilities in this place. As far as I have been able to ascertain, the funds are all being allocated for the good of veterans. It is an area where I am sure there is considerable bipartisan support in this place in ensuring the welfare of those people who have done so much for Australia in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address some aspects of our budgeting process&mdash;and, more particularly, the way in which our funds are expended&mdash;in more general terms than those specific to this particular appropriation outlay. I noticed this morning that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) devoted most of his time debating the quite interesting and serious issue of the dispute that is developing in tertiary education between Victoria and Queensland. A substantial population shift has meant that people in Victoria may now be overserviced in the funding available to their universities and other tertiary institutions, while Queensland may be underserviced, due to population movement from Victoria to Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Universities will defend their funding to the death. It does not have a lot to do with the rights of students; rather, it is all about, `I'm here and I've got the money. Let the students travel.' That is something the government will have to address. As I was pointing out this morning on other issues, the member for Moreton missed the fundamentals, which are that we still have a very substantial shortage of university places relative to the number of people who pass a mark at which they are qualified for tertiary entrance. Had he gone to table 6, `Outlays by Function', in the original budget papers, he would not have had to be Albert Einstein to find the reason why. Looking at it, we find in the 1994-95 budget that defence expenditures are set at $9,637 million; education expenditure, $10,056 million; and health outlays, $17,275 million. I will not bore the House with every one of these figures, but these are three very significant outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one that pops up&mdash;outside social security, which is a very substantial outlay&mdash;is public debt interest. That is the amount of money the Commonwealth is obliged to budget for the purpose of paying interest on the debts the government has accumulated to date. That is $8,385 million, roughly $1 billion less than the figure for defence. If we make the comparison with education, which was the concern of the member for Moreton, it is about $1.5 billion less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I keep repeating this remark, and someone is going to tell me I am boring, but one of the great fundamentals of life is that since the Good Lord worked the bread and fishes miracle, when he fed the multitude with three fishes and five loaves, nobody else has been able to repeat it. It is a simple fact that in our society today if a government chooses to spend $8,385 million on public debt interest then there is an absolute certainty something else goes without. Of course, it is very clear that education is one of those expenditure items that are getting the squeeze. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even clearer when one goes back a bit further in our budget program. We used to find a similarity in outlays between defence, education and health. Certainly that was the case in the days of the Fraser government. But today, because of the introduction of Medicare, we find that health outlays are rapidly working up to double either of those other two items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that people would argue that that is an appropriate outcome. I do not think it is if you are a kid seeking an education, and particularly when you see that grandma cannot get into hospital to get her arthritic hip fixed or maybe the cataracts removed from her eyes. There just does not seem to be any physical manifestation that shows us that our health services are twice as good as they used to be, relative to our education services. But that is what the figures display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, to its credit, now gives us some forward estimates. In other words, our former Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) gives us the government's estimate&mdash;not mine&mdash;of where it thinks those expenditures might go. If we go to 1997-98, which is the last column of figures in table 6, `Outlays by Function', we find an extremely frightening development. It is expected that defence expenditure will go to $10.4 billion, education expenditure to $10.9 billion and health expenditure to $20.2 billion. That last amount is almost the sum of the other two. And, horror or horrors, public debt interest will go to $10 billion. The government's own estimate is that by 1997-98 public debt interest will be equal to the expenditure that we outlay on defending our country&mdash;such a simple item as that&mdash;and educating our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I want to bring to the attention of the House is just what a rotten deal this government is giving those people who have yet to cast a vote, our children. I consciously say that it has had a policy over a decade of `Let the children pay'. It is all right for a Prime Minister to stand up at election time and say to everybody who can hear, `We are a government of great social justice. We will look after you.' I am glad that he did. But what he failed to add to those words was `and pass the cost on to your children'. The fact is that when we left office&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a point at issue when one checks the figures. When Malcolm Fraser said to Australia in his acceptance of defeat speech in 1983, `I leave Australia's finances in good order,' he had a budget deficit of about $4 billion. When we added that money in, Australia owed the world something less than $20 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 80 years of federation, a significant period of that run by conservative governments, the government had knocked up a moderate overall debt. For the parliamentary secretary's information, when one is in business and one wants to assess the value of a business, it is common to go to the bottom line. One does not worry too much about the fluctuations in between; one wants to know what one has made. The bottom line for Australian government in 1983 was an overall debt something less than $20 billion. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bevis" NAMEID="ET4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is that the budget deficit?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the accumulated debt of the Commonwealth government being less than $20 billion. It is now about $100 billion. I am well aware of the surpluses that this government ran. The aggregate pluses and minuses have added about $80 billion to our kids' responsibility to pay off some time in the future. By the government's own admission, it expects to pay out as much in public debt interest in 1997-98 as it will spend on educating those same children. So it halves the amount that it should have spent on their education and it expects them to pay off a $100 billion debt. It is an outrageous situation. It is no good taking this little bit and that little bit and trying to put up arguments. As I said, anybody making an investment goes to the bottom line, and that is the bottom line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nation's gross debt is about $200 billion and our net overseas debt is about $160 billion. Again, it does not take a great mathematical mind to see what percentage of that national overseas indebtedness is in fact the government's debt. Of course, the government pops up and says, `We don't borrow money overseas,' and that is absolutely true; it does not&mdash;or very seldom does. But it cannot go into the marketplace of accumulated savings in a country the size of Australia and suck $100 billion out of it and say it has not affected our overseas debt position. Of course it has. Everybody else has to borrow overseas. In addition, those lending money to the Australian government are frequently in the position that they have borrowed it overseas to lend to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this constant bleating and complaining about Australians failing to save. The government's last response to that was to make them save, or their employers save on their behalf, by the compulsory superannuation guarantee charge. That has been such an ineffective proposition that, without actually having seen the figures, I think I would be prepared to put a small amount of my money on a bet that the net value of those contributions at this point in time would be below the original employer contributions on behalf of those workers. If we went all around the place, found all those SGC funds, added them all up, chucked in the union funds as well and added up what was left, I am prepared to bet a small amount of money that it would be something less than what was originally contributed. That is not much help to Australia and it is not, of course, much help to the people who believe that they are building some sort of retirement fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of all this is the constant lecturing we get from the government about being independent. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, `We've got to have an Australian head of government.' He is quite unambivalent about that. But I have got to say that when we change Bill Hayden's label from His Excellency to Mr President these problems will not disappear. The real problems for Australia in terms of our sovereignty and our independence rest on issues like debt. At $200 billion gross we are talking about a debt that is roughly half our gross domestic product. We are confronted with really serious problems when the servicing charges associated with that debt get up to about 25 per cent of the value of our exports. International interest rates are low at the moment, I think about 12 per cent, so they are not a worry in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We find in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 8 November 1994 an article that I do not think got into one other major newspaper. That shows how little knowledge our more sensationalist journalists have of what is really serious for Australia. The article was seen as only of some interest&mdash;and, I assume, of academic interest&mdash;to people who have business interests and would buy the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I will start well into the article, at a point that is quite interesting. It states that Mr Clinton, the President of the USA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . told a Japanese audience last year that "in the 1980s, when my country went on a huge debt binge&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it did&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Japanese purchases of much of that debt helped to keep our economy going and helped to prevent our interest rates from exploding".</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have the President of the United States making that admission about his gigantic economy. I do not know if it prompted some very senior Japanese bureaucrats to a conclusion, but I have a point to draw to the attention of this government, recognising its policies of borrowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appointed the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who has told it that its position on its debt problem&mdash;otherwise known as the deficit&mdash;is wrong. The government appointed the head of Treasury, who has given it good advice&mdash;that it is wrong. We all know it is wrong. But when a government is a big borrower it naturally generates large overseas debt. I will read the fundamentals of this newspaper story by Peter Hartcher:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Officials of Japan's Ministry of Finance "made an open threat to the Americans", according to the chief economist of Japan's biggest securities company, Mr Richard Koo of the Nomura Research Institute.</PARA>

<PARA>I bet it was. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their purpose was to stem US trade pressure, and to discourage the US from cheapening its dollar as a trade weapon, he says.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not here to condemn the Japanese or make some challenge against them. I am here to warn the government and to ask: if that sort of mechanism, once a country has put itself in debt to the world, can be used as a threat against the biggest economy in the world and, clearly, scare the pants off it, what are we doing in Australia? Why are we continuing to encourage debt? Why is the government, contrary to the advice of all its senior competent advisers, going down this road and putting up all these mythical arguments of one per cent of GDP in the year and whatever? As former Senator Walsh, the government's one-time Minister for Finance, pointed out just the other day, that promises to extend year by year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple economic fact is that governments quite properly borrow in years of recession to try to lift the economy and to meet their debts in the face of reduced revenue and increased expenditures. But the minute they start to get the economy back on the road it is their job to withdraw rapidly. That might cost the government votes, however. This is a government that puts power before responsibility and has no concern for the generations yet to vote, who must pay off these debts. The government must stop borrowing. If it does not stop, it will do irreparable harm in the short term, with another boom-bust cycle. It just cannot go on borrowing money at this level; it cannot go on spending. Even in terms of economic growth I think $11 billion, which is the projected deficit, is about three per cent of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is boasting about growth of four or five per cent but, if three per cent is coming from a direct injection of borrowed money, it is not such an exciting prospect, is it? The simple fact is that we will not get this repaid out of growth, either. Growth, as the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), a local government person, knows, creates its own problems, because we have to fund the infrastructure. We have to spend when we get into a growth phase. Government has huge financial responsibilities. It is not as easy as that. We get only the last little bit to pay off the debt. Growth will not do it for us. There will be just a reduced living standard. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The opposition is more worried about foreign money than the strength of investment coming into Australia. This is typical of the way in which the opposition in the 1990s is examining public policy issues in Australia through the prism of an old-fashioned view of Australia and its economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is those general trends and changes in Australian politics that I wish to address with regard to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and the cognate bills and, in particular, how these trends relate to issues such as the republic and, if I find time, the free trade agreement recently concluded by APEC. A neat symmetry has emerged in the pattern of political change in Australia this century. Both the first and last decades of the 1900s will come to be seen as turning points in the nation's development. In the first decade of federation, the national focus turned inwards. This was motivated by fear of Australia's isolation and the tyranny of distance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national consensus emerged on the virtues of defending Australia from international influences, bar those from Britain. High tariff walls were used to lock out overseas trade. White Australia acted as a barrier to Asian immigration. The cultural cringe restricted international exchanges in the arts and learning. In turn, Britain served as Australia's security blanket. The royal family legitimised our constitution, and the British Foreign Office ran our foreign policy, while Australia's defence relied on the reputation and power of the Royal Navy. No matter how galling and incomprehensible it may now seem, particularly to Australians of my generation, most Australians through to the 1960s regarded themselves more as British than as Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a recent reminder of this when I was reading Gerard Henderson's excellent work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child</EMPHASIS>&mdash;excellent not so much for the subject but for the analysis&mdash;when I noticed opposite page 190 a photograph taken in December 1944, during World War II, at the Albury conference of the Liberal Party. It showed that the party's founder, Robert Menzies, was addressing the delegates against a backdrop of a Union Jack flag&mdash;not the Australian flag that we hear so much of from opposition members but a Union Jack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exposes the way in which the Liberal Party has always been more attracted to the Union Jack in the Australian flag than to the federation star or the Southern Cross. It really exposes the absolute hypocrisy and sham of the opposition's position on changing the Australian flag. Occasionally opposition members of this chamber have their little Australian flags in front of their desks, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) produces literature to talk about the importance of the Australian flag during World War II. At the foundation meeting of the Liberal Party in 1944, there was no Australian flag in the backdrop, only the Union Jack. This exposes the Liberal Party, from its very first day, as being more concerned with Anglophilia and the welfare of the United Kingdom than with Australian values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up to the 1970s, the politics of distance and isolation dominated the Australian political agenda. Federal elections turned on the potency of the communist threat and the yellow peril. Provincial state governments, fearful of their isolation from Canberra, invented the virtues of states rights. After World War II, the United States replaced Britain as the source of Australia's defence dependency. This style of politics ideally suited the objectives of the Liberal and National parties. It is the way of the conservative to play on fears of change and to exaggerate the practical difficulties of reform. No-one did this better than Menzies. His heirs and successors, however, have not been so fortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian politics has now conquered the tyranny of distance. With improvements in transport and communications, Australia is a much more compact and secure society. The stock in trade of conservative politics since Federation&mdash;exploiting fears about Australia's isolation through issues such as protectionism, White Australia, the communist bogey and states rights&mdash;has just about exhausted itself. This has left open the potential for a much more progressive and outward looking style of national politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to exaggerate the extent to which changes in technology have refashioned Australia's outlook on the rest of the world. This is particularly so for young Australians, most of whom now enjoy opportunities to travel and communicate internationally. This has conveyed an understanding of Asian and European cultures and broken the back of Anglophilia. The impact can be seen in each of the national opinion polls. The main difference in public opinion in Australia on issues such as the republic, multiculturalism and the rights of minorities is not between Liberal and Labor voters or city and country residents, but between young and old Australians. The passage of time is supporting the growth of an outward looking confidence about our place in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further gains in technology, such as the information superhighway, will accelerate the international integration of Australian society. Reformers in Australia are no longer stifled by the politics of isolationism and an instinctive cultural fear of change. By any standard the 1990s have delivered a historic opportunity. Only within an outward looking and culturally confident nation can the ideals of social tolerance, meritocracy and internationalism be fully pursued. This is the link between each of the major reforms of this government. Trade liberalisation through APEC, the enhancement of human rights through international treaties, the republic, native title, and support for Australia's cultural identity are motivated by an expansive commitment to national justice and international cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task for Labor, especially within a long-serving federal government, is to stoke along the pace of policy reform. The next wave of change is already drifting onto the national agenda: broadening Australia's defence arrangements beyond the limits and restrictions of ANZUS, entrenching the human rights of Australians in the Bill of Rights, access issues on the information highway, and burying the last remnants of parochial states rights. All of these changes are outside the policy making experience of the Liberal Party and its National Party colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite some internal tensions and debate, the dominant strand of Liberal thought has never been comfortable with internationalism. Menzies clung to White Australia as an article of faith, while the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in the 1980s, tried to revive the virtues of a monocultural society. McEwen was allowed to base his career on tariff protection all round, while the Fraser government walked away  from deregulating the Australian economy and fostering international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through its 50 years, the Liberal Party has been satisfied with an exceptionally narrow and dependent form of international relations; that is, it has sought security, both physical and emotional, from Australia's defence treaty with the United States and from constitutional links with the United Kingdom. Under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), xenophobic themes are being explored. Foreign debt has become a mantra&mdash;as we heard earlier from the member for O'Connor&mdash;not so much through a critique of debt and economic efficiency but because it is foreign, because it comes from overseas. International treaties are under attack, with a proposal for a referendum to limit the foreign external affairs power. Two weeks ago I noticed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper that the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott)&mdash;the chief monarchist and isolationist&mdash;revealed this as a strategy to show `that the United Nations poses a much greater threat to Australia's independence than the United Kingdom'. Labor welcomes the comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The television image of the United Nations has revealed to Australians an organisation at the centre of the world's peacekeeping and humanitarian campaigns. Compare this with the hi-jinx and humiliation of the current generation of royals. More substantially, the elitist and non-participatory nature of the monarchy is well out of step with the best traditions of Australian egalitarianism. By contrast, the United Nations is based on principles of participation and cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>The implementation of its treaties and missions is left as an act of choice for the elected government of Australia. When faced with choices such as these, Australians are more likely to support human rights than the rights of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal Party has twisted itself inside out on the politics of internationalism, and we have seen that again this week. Three months ago, again in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the member for Warringah forecast how `attempts to appeal Tasmania's anti-sodomy laws will cause more disquiet inside the Labor Party than within the federal coalition'. In the list of famous last words, this ranks alongside George A. Custer who, at the Little Big Horn, was purported to have murmured, `The 7th Cavalry has seen better days than these.' So too has the Liberal Party in its understanding of the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one typifies the problems of the Liberal Party in the 1990s more thoroughly than the member for Warringah, one of its youngest and newest members. He is continually trying to rationalise away the failures of the Liberal Party in the 1990s to come up to date with a modern political agenda. He is the great rationaliser of Liberal Party retreats and failures. When the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) lost votes earlier this year at her by-election&mdash;she actually went backwards in a by-election representing the opposition&mdash;the member for Warringah concluded that `the actual lesson is that there is a strong conservative constituency waiting to be tapped'. It is not being tapped by the Liberal Party. </PARA>

Every step backwards in the federal Liberal Party's opposition to the republic is hailed by the member for Warringah as a victory for the monarchy. I notice in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> a report that the Leader of the Opposition will today be announcing his plans for a constitutional convention to assess the issue of constitutional change and reform. In last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the member for Warringah revealed as follows: `Alexander Downer's push for a constitutional convention is a neat political manoeuvre to give all sides something to cheer.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives all sides in the divided Liberal and National parties something to cheer about on an issue in which they can present no better policy to the Australian people than the idea of a constitutional convention.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 3 November the Saulwick poll revealed that a majority of Liberal Party voters support the republic in preference to the constitutional monarchy. If they are keen on listening to their own supporters, they need do no more than consult that opinion poll, where 45 per cent of Liberal voting identifiers said they support the republic, while only 42 per cent said they supported the retention of the Queen as Australia's head of state. If the Liberal Party is serious about the middle ground, about listening to people, and about consultative processes such as a constitutional convention, it should immediately declare its support for an Australian republic and an Australian head of state. Quite frankly, that is what a majority of Liberal Party voters want to see from their party and it is what they want to see entrenched in the policies of this parliament and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tories are stalling the inevitable. The member for Warringah reminds me of the definition of a fanatic: someone who doubles his efforts when all is lost.

These spokespeople for the `land of hope and glory set' are going backwards.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How out of touch can anybody be when a majority of Liberal voters are saying that they want to support a republic? This is a party that claims that a majority view amongst its constituency is non-existent; a party that wants to turn its back, put its head in the sand to the electoral reality, changes and trends in the 1990s. There is a whole range of well-known republicans within the parliamentary Liberal Party. The members for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), Sturt (Mr Pyne), Boothby (Mr Steele Hall), Adelaide (Ms Worth), Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus) and Berowra (Mr Ruddock), and Senators Hill, Teague, Knowles and Calvert, join with their colleagues in state Liberal governments and cabinets in saying it is time for the republic to be a bipartisan aspect of Australian politics. </PARA>

His views were certainly not displayed at the recent APEC meeting at Bogor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament knows full well the way in which the Liberal Party has been uneasy about the concept of a multicultural society. In the mid-1980s the member for Bennelong declared his support for a monocultural society, a throwback to the first decades of federation. He supported One Australia and launched a number of attacks on the concept and scale of Asian migration. This view was repeated by one of his successors as Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, who in a speech to the Western Australian Liberal Party on 25 July 1992 described multiculturalism as `a fundamental mistake in this country' and representing `the politics of division, not the politics of One Nation'. </PARA>

He tried to perpetuate the untruth that the Menzies government `started to dismantle the White Australia policy'. It is simply untrue.

<PARA>The request from the Senate that has arrived today is one of the seven amendments which the government has already described as unconscionable and of a character which would make the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill unworkable. The Greens have proposed that there be a cap of $3 million on the administrative expenditure of the Indigenous Land Corporation and that a further allocation of $3 million be added to the land fund annually to allow for this to occur. The amendment was supported in the Senate by opposition senators and the Independent senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government rejects the idea of a cap on the administrative expenses of the ILC and, consequently, any further appropriation to cater for those expenses. As an independent statutory body, the ILC should not have such restrictions placed on its operations. It should have the flexibility to determine the most appropriate use of its funds, including how much it will dedicate to administration. This is consistent with the arrangements for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation on which the ILC is modelled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to fetter the ILC in terms of its ability to operate efficiently and effectively.

The government has already indicated that it is putting into the land fund amounts which it considers to be fiscally responsible. We are not going to increase that amount to suit the purposes of this amendment, which are flawed and irresponsible.

In the Senate last night an amendment was put to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 to enable the land fund to receive an extra $3 million each year for the purposes of administration. The reason for this was so that the money in the land fund could be used for exactly the reason it was meant for&mdash;to provide land and land management for Aboriginal people. Administration would necessarily eat out of that fund. So an amendment was moved in the Senate yesterday to enable an extra $3 million to be given to the land fund to cover administration expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>

This government&mdash;which regards itself as the champion of indigenous people, which said it was helping the dispossessed people of Australia who could not benefit from the Native Title Act&mdash;said that allocating an extra $3 million to make sure that the money in the land fund is not used up for administrative purposes is fiscally irresponsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know why the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) is not in here to put his position before the House. I would like to hear his explanation as to why he has refused to give the indigenous people of this country an extra $3 million so the administration of the land fund does not take up money that could otherwise be used to buy land for indigenous people and to help them with land management. The minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), has given us no reasons. Again I ask the minister why the relevant minister is not here telling the people of Australia, telling the Aboriginal people of Australia, why the government is refusing to give them an extra $3 million for administration of the land fund so that all the money that is put in the land fund can be used for the purchase of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are on this subject, I should mention that the government spoke loudly and long about its generosity to the Aboriginal people and to this billion dollar fund that it was going to give Aboriginal people to buy land.

The opposition has asked for an extra $3 million, an extra seven per cent, to cover administration costs and the government has said no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the minister that members of the public who are in the gallery might be wondering at this time why the government would take such a petty stand as this. I would suggest that the reason is simply that the government, in an effort to play politics, said at the very beginning, `We will not look at any coalition amendments; we will oppose every amendment.' In doing that, the government is opposing what all indigenous people in Australia have asked it for: more money for the fund&mdash;in this case, money for administration of the fund so that that extra money that has been given to them to purchase land can go for that purpose, to purchase land and not be eaten up by a bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, in supporting this $3 million, and the Aboriginal people of Australia say shame to this government.

Why is he not in the House explaining to us why he will not give the indigenous people of Australia an extra $3 million to administer the fund that this government has made so much of a fuss of?

I have had Aboriginal groups from Western Australia saying, `The government did not come and consult with us.' I have had representations from 14 Aboriginal tribal groups in Queensland saying, `The government did not consult with us.' I have had representation from New South Wales, from the New South Wales Land Council representing 117 land councils. For the information of the minister at the table, who may not know this, New South Wales has the greatest number of Aboriginal people of any state in Australia and yet the government did not consult with the New South Wales Land Council.

It has told the world at large, including the Australian public, `We consulted.' The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has said&mdash;these are his words&mdash;`In this matter of the land fund, I have consulted more widely than on any other matter.' That is what he has said. If indeed that is true, what does it say about the government's general consultation process? If in this matter the government did not consult with all those Aboriginal groups around Australia who have come to me&mdash;and this was the most exhaustive consultation it had ever had&mdash;what does that say about all the other consultations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the division, I was concluding my remarks on the Liberal Party's attitude to the republic and Asia. I noted how, at the formation of the Liberal Party 50 years ago, not the Australian flag but the Union Jack stood behind Robert Menzies. Just as in 1944 the Liberal Party looked to Britain for its inspiration, 50 years later, in the 1990s, it is still looking to Britain. It is turning its back on Australia's opportunities in Asia and looking for inspiration from the United Kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quoting from the article of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Review</EMPHASIS>, where he calls for a restoration of the official attitudes to Asia of the post World War II period; that is, the restoration of the White Australia policy and restoration of trade protection barriers against Asia. That is the sort of policy and perspective that one of the opposition's youngest and newest members to the House wants to put before the Australian public in the 1990s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reminded by the honourable member for Kingston that he is a young fogy on the opposition benches. I will conclude with a quote from Henry Lawson. It reflects perfectly how the Liberal Party's views about the republic are totally outdated. He said this in the 1890s:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why on earth do we want closer connections with England? We have little in common with English people except our language. We are fast becoming an entirely different people. We are more liberal and, considering our age, more progressive than England is . . . The loyal talk of patriotism, Old England, the motherland . . . Bah! It sickens one.</PARA>
<PARA>I am absolutely sickened by the views of the honourable member for Warringah and the way in which the Liberal Party, 50 years after its foundation, still has the Union Jack in the backdrop behind its latest leader. It still has an attachment to, and seeks inspiration from, Britain instead of embracing the opportunities in multiculturalism and trade liberalisation that Australia can derive from the Asia-Pacific region. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure what the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was talking about, but he certainly was not talking about the bills currently before the House, which are Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1994-95, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1994-95 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1994-95.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion, we are here to discuss the government's use and supply of finance. The honourable member who just spoke did not talk about the government's use of finance; he made a blatant attack on those who sit on this side of the House. But I intend to take this opportunity to discuss the funding that the federal government provides to local government authorities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last six months I have travelled the length and breadth of this country talking to local councillors, council workers and, very importantly, ratepayers. There is no doubt in my mind that the responsibilities of local government are increasing at a steady pace, sometimes at the insistence of other levels of government, sometimes due to the effort of local government itself, and sometimes because of natural causes. These new responsibilities include areas such as the management of some of the environmental matters, for instance, dealing with the consequences of drought; the provision of migrant facilities; and preparing for the implications of the Hilmer report and the national competition policy that the Hilmer report refers to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that, at long last, we are now starting to see that local government has been included in the debate in terms of the implications for our national competition policy. Quite clearly, the implications of Hilmer on local government in this nation are enormous, and they have to be part of any debate about the implications of a national competition policy. I am pleased to see that they are now part of those discussions, and they must continue to be part of those discussions. Without local government being part of those discussions, we will not see the three tiers of government in this country being part of the debate. The implications for a national competition policy are immense and, of course, local government must be part of any discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst new duties abound, the everyday demands on local governments are no less. In urban areas, the cost of providing services to a rapidly expanding population verging on a critical mass places enormous pressure on existing services, the environment and the quality of life of other residents. In some rural areas, the structural reform that is taking place in the agricultural industries has reduced the number of privately funded services, such as banks. It would be no news to members of the House that many banks, because of the structural adjustment in agriculture, no longer find keeping their agencies open in many rural areas a commercially viable operation. In turn, this transfers greater responsibilities to councils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other remote areas struggle to cope with the needs of non-rate paying, fly-in-fly-out mining operators. Quite clearly, if a mine opens up in an area and the people who work there fly in and fly out, the local government still has a responsibility to maintain roads and other services that will support that mining operation. Those people are not contributing rates because they fly in and fly out. It places additional burdens on those councils where the fly-in-fly-out practice of a mining operation is in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite a critical point that must be addressed because those councils have to provide the other services that any community demands. Once a mining operation commences in an area, the larger and more expanded community places additional burdens on things such as health and the shopping operations of a community. They might have supported a smaller community, but once you get the fly-in-fly-out operators you double, or treble in some instances, the size of the population. It is very important that the fly-in-fly-out implications, and the needs of those communities, are considered at a local council level and, in turn, by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same way, the impact of urban areas which are trying to balance out the costs and benefits of a high tourist population has to be considered. Where there is a high tourist population, there is an increased transient population that impacts on the local community. Who will bear the brunt of providing the services? It will fall back onto the local councils. Whilst grants are distributed on a per capita basis, the per capita distribution never takes into account the transient population that might be passing through an area due to the tourist population or due perhaps to the fly-in-fly-out operators of a mine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I would like to, if I may, preface my question by stating that the coalition parties welcome the Bogor declaration but that we seek some clarification about its specific implications for Australia. I refer the Prime Minister to the fact that the Bogor declaration commits the Australian market to be totally free of tariff and non-tariff barriers by 2010. Will all countries, including the European Union, have free access to the Australian market by 2010 or will the free market apply only to APEC countries? If the free market applies to all countries, will the government be demanding any concessions from the European Union in exchange for free access to the Australian market? Will the Prime Minister give a clear statement as to whether the market liberalisation provisions of the Bogor declaration are discriminatory or non-discriminatory?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thing is, you have to have something to offer to get a shirt, so that leaves you out. These relationships, personal as they have become, do augur well as suspicions and potential hostility are automatically lowered when people know each other so well. One of the things that has surprised me in recent years, particularly in north Asia, is that people leading governments and belonging to assemblies, parliaments, diets and other representative bodies do not particularly know the other leaders of nearby countries all that well. I think this is changing in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a huge event and, as I said at my press conference in Indonesia, without any doubt it is the start of the Pacific Century. There will be improved opportunities for countries like Australia, which have not easily been part of any trading area. Even though we have had in the past some benefits from so-called imperial preference with Britain, we have not been part of the trading area. For instance, we are not part of ASEAN or NAFTA. We have basically been a single trader, trading bilaterally with countries, so it is a great and significant change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition asked me about whether, in the event that APEC decides&mdash;and it has&mdash;to reduce trade protectionism and trade barriers, both tariff and non-tariff barriers, the benefits will be exclusive to the member states or extended to other countries. This is one of the matters that will need to be considered in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It has been one of the matters which have already been discussed by the Eminent Persons Group, ministers, APEC ministers and leaders. There are differing opinions about it. I think Japan will take the view that it trades on an MFN basis and it would continue to want to. The United States normally takes the view that it is not about to give a preference to anybody without some reciprocity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Leader of the Opposition may know that under chapter 24 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, in what then claims, that is, the nomination of the free trade area or an FTA as it is called, countries can agree unilaterally to extend the preference to third countries or maintain the preference within the free trade area. For instance, CER between Australia and New Zealand is a free trade area. Australia could, if it wanted to, extend those preferences to another country. This is the case as well under a free trade agreement under chapter 24 of the GATT.</PARA>

Therefore the answer to the opposition's question about discrimination, whether it is all black or all white, is that it is black, white and grey&mdash;there are all sorts of colours in the thing&mdash;because under a free trade agreement it is possible for countries to preserve the preference or to extend it, to make it MFN or preferential. These are matters which will properly be discussed by ministers and leaders at the next APEC leaders meeting in Osaka, Japan in 1995. It is at that point that I think we will get some definition on the issue. Given the fact that APEC accounts for just on half the world's GDP and half the world's production, you are talking about a major change in the world trading system. So matters of preference and discrimination will not be decided lightly; they will be decided against a backdrop of much discussion over the next 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you can see from the opposition's interjections that they shy away from good news, and a change to Australia's position in the world that they could never have conceived of and could never possibly have executed. I  have indicated in answer to the previous question that the Bogor summit represents no less than a beginning for the Pacific Century. The declaration which APEC leaders have made, representing half the world's GDP and 40 per cent of its trade, ushers in a change to the world trading system and improves the future for all those involved, including future generations of Australians. The historic nature of this meeting is difficult to exaggerate. I am not sure that the scale of its implications is yet fully understood. By the year 2020, APEC will include seven of the 10 largest economies and by the turn of the century will account for 57 per cent of world trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal thing APEC does is join together East Asia and North America. So, rather than the world break into three trading blocs, that is Europe, the Americas and Asia, by this historic declaration we will see a trans-Pacific result: nations of the Asia-Pacific, East Asia and North America and some of the states of the continent of South America will be joined together. As a consequence of that, it stands to change the balance of world affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting demonstrates the Asia-Pacific region's new weight in the global economy and APEC's capacity to influence the multilateral trading system into the 21st century. In the first place, our decision to achieve free and open trade means that all APEC economies have agreed on a shared goal, and that goal will drive our trade agendas for the next two decades in a mutually reinforcing way. In the second place, it will strengthen the prospects of peace and stability as the region copes with enormous economic and political change. In the third place, it offers a secure place for Australia in the region&mdash;a place at a very large table which gives us opportunities we have never had before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration is historic for its terms. Let me read from paragraph 6, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further agree to announce our commitment to complete the achievement of our goal of free and open trade in investment in the Asia-Pacific no later than the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We further agree . . . to complete the achievement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not `aims', `mights', `maybes', `best endeavours'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of free and open trade by 2020.</PARA>
<PARA>The declaration goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industrialised economies will be achieving the goal of free and open trade in investment no later than 2010&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it says `achieving the goal'&mdash;not `might be', `looking at it' or `thinking about it' but `achieving the goal'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and developing economies no later than 2020.</PARA>
<PARA>The declaration then goes on to talk about trade facilitation because that is important too; that is, investment agreements, standards, the backdrop in competition policy, company law, et cetera. Paragraph 7 of the declaration states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement and support this substantial process of liberalisation, we decide to expand and accelerate APEC's trade and investment facilitation programs.</PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we decide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not `might decide', `thinking about it' or `maybe' but `we decide'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to expand and accelerate APEC's trade and investment facilitation programs.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to talk in that vein. Its significance is profound. Let me take this opportunity again to compliment and congratulate President Suharto on the great wisdom and leadership he has shown in seizing so strongly the opportunity presented by his chairmanship of APEC. I want to record my admiration for his role in this. That such a lead should come from Asia is truly profound. These sorts of changes have typically come from the G7 countries or the OECD, but here you have had almost a role reversal, or a complete role reversal, with the leader of the fourth largest country in the world&mdash;a developing country&mdash;proposing a free trade agenda to a clutch of developed countries. That is significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is also significant is that, for all the years that we have heard of the North-South dialogue, of the developing countries being able to share in the wealth of the developed countries, it has always been something that has been given lip-service. But in APEC we are not seeing a body like the European Union which is a group of developed economies; what we are seeing is highly developed economies like the US and Japan sitting beside developing countries like China, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea interspersed with countries like Australia, Canada, New Zealand, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of APEC is unique in that it encompasses developed and developing countries. As a consequence, the notion of these large developing countries in Asia, like China and Indonesia, sharing in the growth of world trade and investment is now going to be a very clear possibility and an achievement that these countries in the past would not have been able to achieve successfully other than over a long period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to recognise the vision and courage shown by all APEC leaders, many of whom have had to make difficult decisions for a greater long-term good. Let me also compliment President Clinton for his decision to hold the first APEC leader's meeting at Blake Island in Seattle in 1993 and for then being prepared to be involved with a second meeting in Indonesia in 1994 where an ambitious free trade agenda was being put. At a time when there are negotiations on the Uruguay Round in the US Congress and at a time when there have been pressures on the presidency coming from NAFTA, this again was a fairly courageous stand on his part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the APEC leaders also underlined the importance of early ratification of the GATT obligations. We will be doing that in this parliament. The APEC leaders in the communique urged all member states to give early ratification to those obligations. As you know, this evening the President of Korea, President Kim Young Sam, will be in Australia. The process of ratification of the GATT Round is already happening in the assembly of Korea. This was a day of great significance to Australia, the Asia-Pacific and the world. It will completely shift the balance in terms of world investment and trade.</PARA>

That has flowed through recently to the unemployment rate; in the last 12 months we have seen the unemployment rate fall by two per cent to 9.1 per cent. As we go past that, it is worth taking note that if the participation rate&mdash;the proportion of the population of working age who want to work&mdash;had remained the same as it was when we came into office, that rate of 9.1 per cent would be only 5.2 per cent. It is that increase from 5.2 per cent to 9.1 per cent which is accounted for by an additional 400,000 people being in the work force through a higher participation rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of inflation, our outcomes are exceedingly good, both historically and in comparison with other countries. Our inflation rate for the last 12 months to June was 1.7 per cent compared with the OECD average of 2.3 per cent. In the September quarter it went up to 1.9 per cent, but we are still well below the OECD average. We have been below 2 1/2 per cent for the last three years. Our average rate of inflation since we have been in office has been just over five per cent, compared with the average under the Fraser government of 10 1/2 per cent&mdash;in fact, 10.7 per cent. The inflation rate that those people over there were able to achieve when in office was more than double the inflation rate which the Australian people have experienced under this government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Given the public uproar over proposed imports of beef from the United States, is it a fact that an American beef importer can buy American cattle at prices 60 per cent higher than he would pay in Australia, process the beef in American abattoirs, transport it to the seaboard and across the wharves, ship it across the Pacific, move it across our notoriously expensive waterfront and distribute it in Australia and the American beef would still be cheaper than the Australian product? Does the Prime Minister therefore agree with the Industry Commission report which says that Australia is not competitive in this major industry, our largest agricultural export industry, because of outdated and inefficient work practices as well as excessive government taxes and charges? If we cannot outperform the American beef industry in our own domestic market because of failed micro-economic policy, how can we possibly reach our potential in Asia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Do you know that song that says, `I've got my mojo working'? Well, we have got our mojo over there working hard for us. It is very clear to us that the competitiveness of Australia has come from a number of things, including the competitive exchange rate system, which the coalition never had the courage to introduce. A lot of the competitiveness of Australian rural enterprise has come from changes in the exchange rate turning large nominal depreciation into a real depreciation through this government's policies over time with a very large reduction of the trade weighted index from the early 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it any wonder that the farm sector used to say, `How come, particularly in the 1970s, we were efficient producers, but we virtually got very poor incomes?' Of course, it was because of the exchange rate. Because the opposition had no wages policy, the only anti-inflation policy it had was to keep the exchange rate overvalued to keep imports cheaper. But by keeping the exchange rate overvalued it made the exports of the primary producing sector massively uncompetitive.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been a bit of speculation, Prime Minister, while you have been away that a few of the rugby league matches might end up changing in nature. With the proposed development of a superleague some people have been speculating that people might have less access to free to air coverage of these sporting codes, including the alarmist story in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that has to be made is that at the moment there is no superleague. At the moment it is clear that the Australian Rugby League is working with a number of parties about ensuring the future development of the code, but today there is no superleague. The advice which has been received from the ARL is that it is planning in the 1995 season&mdash;when the Steelers, Mr Speaker, might do better than this year&mdash;to have an expanded competition with up to 20 clubs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Services Act allows me to list an event so it then cannot be shown exclusively on pay TV and denied to free to air viewers. It is a condition of the licence of the pay TV operators that they cannot secure the rights to events that are on the list until a free to air operator has first secured the rights or had a chance to secure them. This has been done with a number of major sporting events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With rugby league, the events that are under the control of New South Wales and the ARL that are shown&mdash;that is, the premiership rounds, the state of origin matches and the finals series&mdash;are on the list and, therefore, protected for the constituents of the member for Macarthur and others. New competitions, such as the proposed superleague, are not exempt from the provisions of the act. If I consider that some event is of national sporting significance and should be included in the anti-syphoning list, I can do that at any time; it gets gazetted and then it is subject to disallowance. However, an event which does not yet exist cannot be added to the list. That is pretty self-evident to most people but perhaps not to the person who wrote for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would like to assure members that I will continue to monitor the development of the proposed superleague. For what it is worth, my own personal view is that, whatever name it may go under, Australia's best rugby league should continue to be available on free to air. I do not just mean the finals and grand final; it should include the weekly matches as well. I am sure the ARL will be very keen to ensure that the supporters of rugby league continue to have as wide access as possible to those matches. I think we also have to ensure that the other events that were on the anti-syphoning list also remain on free to air. At the same time, if the name of the code is to change, we will continue to ensure that the promise the government made gets kept: that major sporting events that are currently on free to air will stay on free to air.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, contrast that with the views of the opposition. When you look very closely at the words that have been expressed by Senator Alston about this and other issues, you find Senator Alston makes it clear that the opposition's position is that the list I drew up is too extensive. The views that are expressed by Senator Alston are hand-wringing views about his concerns over the profitability of the pay TV industry. The government has made it clear that its prime concern is for the Australian viewers who, we think, should continue to have access to these events.</PARA>

I refer to the distribution of wealth through Indonesia and a change in the lifestyle. The fact that 60 per cent of Indonesians were living below the poverty line 10 years ago and that has now fallen to 17 per cent represents a remarkable change in the distribution of wealth in that country. It is apparent for anybody who goes through it to see. Here we are talking about a country which is eight flying hours across an archipelago of thousands of islands held together by a common language and which is administered in such a way that there is growth and employment, because that economy has been growing at about eight per cent a year for the last 12 years. This is changing it dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bringing Indonesia into part of the world community and staging an international meeting of such circumstance and moment as the APEC leaders meeting, and the President of Indonesia playing such a key role in the leadership of that communique in its aspirations and in garnering support for it, means that Indonesia has a much larger stake now in the Asia-Pacific region in a community of countries amongst whom some have liberal values&mdash;small `l' liberal values, I might add&mdash;on these questions about the rights of the individual.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, a great many non-Aboriginal Australians do not realise that generations of Aboriginal people were separated from their families as a result of policies of state and territory governments, of institutions and, indeed, of the national government itself when it had responsibility for the Northern Territory. This practice of separation continued under state and territory governments in the lifetimes of most living Australians and in the lifetimes of virtually all the members of this House. The policies were starkly brought home to all of us with the statistics of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which showed that 43 of the 99 people whose lives were examined by the royal commission were people who had been separated from their natural families through intervention by state authorities, missions or other institutions. That figure of 43 out of 99 is a particularly chilling one.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In August and October of this year, the Reserve Bank lifted official interest rates in the name of keeping down inflation. Yesterday, a member of the Reserve Bank board, Bill Kelty, urged unions to `Go for it' on wage claims which will obviously fuel inflation. Do you concede Mr Kelty has an obvious conflict of interest in being a member of the Reserve Bank board and in encouraging wage claims as secretary of the ACTU? Who should we believe&mdash;the Reserve Bank governor who wants to keep inflation down or one of his board members who wants to stoke it up?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3732" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows quite well that Mr Kelty said the impact of any wage claims on the economy would depend on the degree to which they were backed by productivity and profit sharing. Of course that is true. The point we have been making is that there is nothing wrong with workers getting increases in wages in advance of the rate of inflation so long as they are backed by increased productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If companies are prepared to offer their employees a share of increased profits, and the profits are at high levels, that is also all right. What is not all right is increasing unit labour costs in a way which will push up the rate of inflation, lose the comparability that we have with the inflation rates of our major trading partners, damage our competitiveness and damage our prospects for future economic and employment growth. That is clearly not all right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see anything in what Mr Kelty is saying that indicates he is pursuing some irresponsible course. He is clearly saying in the interview which appears on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review </EMPHASIS>today that productivity and profit sharing are a basis upon which the economic impact of wage increases can and should be limited. Wage earners, those making wage claims on their behalf and those who are responding to those claims, need to bear in mind that if the outcome of all that is not in line with the possibility of keeping the underlying rate of inflation in that two to three per cent range, that will have clear implications for policy, because policy will need to be changed in order to ensure that we do remain somewhere within that range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the Reserve Bank have made it absolutely clear that the great structural change that has occurred in Australia, above all others&mdash;certainly there have been a lot of structural changes&mdash;is getting low inflation. We certainly will not see that enormously beneficial structural change thrown away. If the outcomes of wage determination are such that they are not compatible with the maintenance of low inflation, obviously policy will have to be tighter than it would otherwise need to be. All those involved in wage determination need to understand that.</PARA>

They will introduce three major changes to the Corporations Law in relation to share buybacks, company registers and, very importantly for the small business community, reforms to proprietary companies. This will allow single individuals to incorporate and, for the vast majority of Australian companies, do away with the need to lodge annual returns with the Australian Securities Commission.

The problem was that, when the Prime Minister wrote to the Leader of the Opposition, the opposition leader did not even bother to respond. The fact of the matter is that the bill introduced into this House was the subject of an exhaustive process of consultation and of a very significant face-to-face meeting with the Prime Minister of this country and key indigenous organisations, a number of which were referred to in the question.

This happened through the 1980s, with a very large equipment and investment phase in the Australian economy. I am pleased to say it is happening again. Despite some questioning and some scepticism on the part of some commentators and, of course, cynicism on the part of the coalition we are now seeing quite strong investment figures coming through. As a consequence that is coming from a very high level of profits in the economy. It is coming from a low inflation rate. It is coming from a pick-up in consumer confidence as high as we have seen it at any time in the last 20 years. Therefore, the state of business opinion matters a great deal in respect of public policy and the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very pleased to see that a number of leading business community figures are supporting the government. Mr Ritchie from McDonald's said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party have an outstanding group of young ministers and those people behind the minister are a formidable opposition to take on.</PARA>
<PARA>But he went on to say of the coalition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are not half as good as the Labor Party group. It seems to me they have lost their way. One of their most important constituencies was the business community and my observation is that they've lost the business community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact I pointed out that what the Labor Party has achieved in the last eight years was probably more than the Liberals had done in any of their previous terms. I think what the Liberal Party need to do is to decide what they're really on about, what their platform is, what their constituency is and until they do that it really doesn't matter who is leading them.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What their major policy lines are is very unclear. In fact I know that there is a thought amongst the Liberals that, you know, the less they say about policy the better and at the last minute they will whack John Howard in there and get elected at the next election. I think they're dreaming if they're serious in that thought that they have considered that I have heard expressed.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ritchie is not alone. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> recently one chief executive of a large finance company put his criticisms succinctly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business is not so worried about the Liberal Party because there's not much to care about. It is a pathetic party at every level. Who wants to give money to a loser? And I regard myself as a Liberal.</PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman of the Business Council, Mr Ian Salmon, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think there is certainly a need for the opposition party to regally state its case, stick to it and be seen to be a true alternative government.</PARA>
<PARA>So the state of the parties does matter. The support of the business community does matter. It matters in public opinion terms. It matters in political terms. It matters in the climate for investment. It matters in regard to the confidence with which the business community undertakes investment knowing that the government is in charge of the economy and society, knowing that low inflation and a healthy profit share in the economy will be maintained and knowing that the government has the policies that can actually deliver the goods&mdash;and not just the government, not just the existing cabinet and ministry, but a significant group of people in the back bench of the government who in the future could qualify for ministerial office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all key and, I think, important judgments by the business community which reflect poorly on the opposition. I finish on that point. I have often said, `With the Liberal Party, the problem is not the jockey but the horse.' That is exactly the point Mr Ritchie is making. Until you get your policies straight over there, it will not matter who is leading you.</PARA>

I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the claim by Ms Laura Tingle at the launch of her new book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Chasing the future</EMPHASIS> that her book documents your `greatest culpability in the lead-up to the recession', which was that you `consistently lied about the fact that the government was pushing up interest rates in 1988'. Given this documented history of dishonesty in relation to economic policy, why should anyone believe you when you say that you will not push up interest rates to 14 per cent or more? Why should anyone believe that you have abandoned the policies which have caused mass unemployment, which have widened the gap between the rich and the poor in our society and which have made Australia a more unequal and inegalitarian society?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought the Governor of the Reserve Bank rather eloquently defended my position in launching Ms Tingle's book. He knows because he was around as Secretary to the Treasury and as governor of the central bank. I have read in this House before things which the former governor had to say. He talked about dealings with the government and said that the propriety of them and the way in which the government related to the bank were such that there was never any pressure, other than proper discussion about a shared interest in the monetary environment. He said, `You have to be around a long time to know that this was not always so.' Do you remember that quote from Bob Johnson? Guess who he was talking about?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great pleasure that I propose this matter of public importance recognising the achievements in Jakarta of the APEC trade deal. The conclusion of the APEC deal should be one of those rare occasions in this parliament where we as a parliament and as a community on a bipartisan basis congratulate the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on their substantial achievement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 20 years time, when this country is deriving the  benefits of this historic agreement and when most of the members of this House will be long gone, the role that the Prime Minister and the government have played in this historic agreement will be well and truly remembered because, while there will be winners and losers in this deal, there is absolutely no doubt that Australia is a very big winner from the APEC deal in Jakarta. It is a big winner in terms of our long-term economic future. We have secured through this deal our long-term economic future because this free trade agreement brings together half of the world's production and communities that span four continents. It means that, by the year 2020, we will have a trade community where seven of the world's 10 wealthiest economies are coming together in a trade agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement reached at APEC marks, I think, probably the most significant foreign policy achievement for Australia since the decision by John Curtin in 1942 to embrace a new security policy future for Australia. In 1942 he turned away from the United Kingdom and turned towards the United States. The achievements at Bogor were made possible by Australian political leadership, particularly by the leadership of our Prime Minister, our Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and our Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC really is an Australian political innovation forged by Australian Labor governments. As a concept it was sold to a sceptical region to the point where now it is part and parcel of the policy superstructure of the world. Five years ago this achievement would simply have been inconceivable. When an Australian Prime Minister first proposed that APEC should become an annual heads of government meeting, many people in this country and in the region thought that we had overreached ourselves; they thought that it could not be done. We had not overreached ourselves. Within two years we had an inaugural meeting in Seattle. We now have this meeting in Indonesia which lays out a blueprint for free trade, free flows of investment and economic growth for our region into the next century. What was seen only a couple of years ago as a remote vision which was fraught with difficulty, if not impossible, has now become an economic reality&mdash;and that reflects well upon the actions of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential ingredient in putting the theory of free trade into practice has been an Australian Prime Minister, backed by an Australian Labor foreign minister. We have managed to forge this agreement, along with President Suharto and President Clinton, in a way in which nobody could have thought possible a couple of years ago. In essence, APEC's Bogor declaration is the jewel in the crown of Australian Labor foreign policy achievements and probably the most significant achievement of our present Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the Labor Party has always been one of pursuing an activist foreign policy. In 1942 John Curtin and his colleagues simply did not sit in their rooms and mope when it became clear that Britain could not provide Australia with a security guarantee. Instead, they looked creatively at the world around them and engaged the United States. They took the lead in forging alliances with the United States. What did the conservatives have to say then? They still looked to Britain, as they do today. Again it was an Australian Labor government in 1972 which finally took the lead in recognising the political existence of a quarter of humanity when we finally recognised the government in Beijing. For a quarter of a century the conservatives in this country simply pretended that China did not exist. We changed this, as a Labor government, in 1972. Since the election of this Labor government in 1983, this activist tradition in foreign policy has continued unabated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement this week in Indonesia is simply the crowning achievement of activist foreign policy from Labor governments. It will mean bigger and better economic growth. It will mean more and better paid jobs. It secures, in effect, a future for our children. It will radically expand the trading sectors of the economy and pave the way not only for more jobs but more highly paid jobs, more secure jobs, more highly trained jobs and a better standard of living for all of this community. This agreement gives this country great optimism for the future&mdash;the sort of optimism that we require if we are going to make it in the world of international trade. This agreement puts us at the centre of world economic activity and, as the Prime Minister has said, it puts us at the biggest table of them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that in this debate today we recognise the role that the Prime Minister has played. I know President Clinton and President Suharto have said that this agreement would not have been possible if it had not been for the activist role of Australian Prime Ministers, particularly the activist role of Prime Minister Keating. It is not only foreign leaders who have been paying tribute to the role played by the Prime Minister in putting this deal together; it is also many commentators in this country&mdash;people who are acknowledged as influential commentators. Today I would like to quote from one of those influential commentators. He said that the Prime Minister is `taking the country in the right direction on "big picture" issues'. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating is painting a vision for Australia which is inspiring and achievable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is significant about the PM's recent detailed pronouncements is the extent to which they synthesise a range of domestic and foreign policy issues by demonstrating their beneficial integration.</PARA>
<PARA>He also described Prime Minister Keating's address to the Asia-Australia Institute last month as `one of the most important statements ever uttered by an Australian Prime Minister and probably the most significant in peacetime'. He went on to say that he enthusiastically supports Mr Keating's analysis of Australia's role in the Asia-Pacific region. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PM expressed it admirably&mdash;`We do not, and cannot, aim to be Asian or European or anything else but Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He is correct because we are united by shared values based essentially on tolerance, a sense of fair play, love of family, desire for financial independence, overall self-reliance and a willingness to learn new things.</PARA>
<PARA>Who was the very influential Australian commentator who made that comment? Who could it have been? It was Mr Ian Macphee, who until recently was an opposition frontbencher in this House. There is no person in the Australian community who would be more qualified to judge the achievements of the Prime Minister in this matter than Mr Macphee&mdash;someone who was unceremoniously removed from this House by the current member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) and the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is ample evidence of the achievements of this government, its foreign minister, its trade minister and, particularly, the Prime Minister. It is not just a question of economic benefit. It is not just a question of our economic future. APEC also affords this country the prospect of peace in our region, of integration of those countries on the eastern side of the Pacific into the affairs of the western side of the Pacific and Asia. APEC will become an anchor which will keep the United States engaged in our part of the world. That is good for America, good for Australia and good for the region's long-term stability and security as well. Without APEC, none of that would be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC is not just an economic agreement; it is an agreement which secures the long-term security needs of this community. In the United States there are always isolationist trends and forces at work. The pressure to retreat to a fortressed America is always evident in the United States. APEC provides a major force for keeping the United States engaged in the world and the region rather than simply looking inward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the economic and long-term security benefits, APEC also provides a mechanism for the development of long-term dialogue and relationships between all of the diverse political traditions in our region. Prior to APEC there was no such mechanism to pull 18 totally different political cultures into a single decision making body, but that has occurred in the forum in Jakarta. We should not pretend that APEC will solve all our regional problems and tensions&mdash;it cannot&mdash;but it can certainly help in minimising them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great thing about APEC is that it surprised and stunned all of the diplomatic professionals. Those who spend their time watching and observing diplomatic events, usually cynically, those who are used to diplomatic achievements occurring at a snail's pace, have simply been stunned by the course over the last couple of years&mdash;first of all, by the events in Seattle and then by the crowning glory of the decisions that were taken in Indonesia. All of these cynics were proved wrong. The movement towards free trade, as the Prime Minister said in question time, is now a reality. If it had not been for the pushing, the cajoling and the constant support and activities of the Prime Minister and his foreign minister, it is doubtful that the achievements of recent times would have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what have we had in the House today from the opposition? Has that bipartisan spirit that I called for before been demonstrated? Is there any evidence that those opposite really do support APEC and the free trade deal? What have they had to say about trade policy? We heard the usual cynicism again today&mdash;a grudging welcome from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), tinged by the usual cynicism and lack of policy alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that most of those opposite would probably think APEC is an insurance company. Those opposite are to trade issues what Frankenstein's monster would be to ballroom dancing. It is a very ugly combination, a very uncomfortable combination. Those opposite do not have a full policy alternative. Let us see what they had to say about policy at their recent conference. An article by Tom Burton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 31 October stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere was this more evident than in the economic debate, where the sole motion dealing with the economy was whisked through in a couple of minutes with only one speech from Shadow Treasurer Peter Costello.</PARA>
<PARA>There was one motion, with one speaker, on economic policy at their national conference. It was left to outsiders to offer ideas. The article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Downer's speech about the resurgence of Liberalism was met by quiet applause, as the reality of his record low opinion-poll ratings overwhelmed his rhetoric. Toasts to the Queen and Lady Menzies tickled the traditionalists, but made the whole event strangely like a time warp&mdash;more like a country town debutantes' ball than a modern political conference.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that accurately sums up the trade approach and the lack of policy of those opposite. It sums up the fact that it still looks to Britain and has not come to grips with trading in our region. The Leader of the Opposition has spent almost a third of his life living in Great Britain and has a policy approach which is borne from that era. The opposition is indeed living in a time warp. That is why it has its leadership paralysis&mdash;which is accompanied, as I said earlier, by a policy paralysis. Nowhere is this policy and leadership paralysis more evident than in the events in this House. Whether we are talking about APEC, interest rates or unemployment, there is no policy alternative from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we review the tactics the opposition has implemented in this House in recent times, we see that the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has effectively been on strike. It has not been attacking or highlighting any of these issues because it is more concerned with bringing the Leader of the Opposition down. This is demonstrated very perceptively in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> this week, where Laurie Oakes says that he was talking to a Liberal MP and the Liberal MP said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I saw you talking to Howard . . . I would have joined you, but he'd already spoken to me five times today.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for Bennelong is out there gathering the numbers. He is deliberately going on strike in this House and he is deliberately sabotaging any political attack upon the government with the leadership struggle. The leadership struggle is simply a system&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's emphasis on APEC therefore reflects directly the growing significance of the Asia-Pacific in Australia's economic relations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is much faster, yes. East Asia now takes 60 per cent of Australia's exports, which is up from 50 per cent five years ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While trade and economic relations in the Asia-Pacific have been growing rapidly, a high level of protection is still afforded to trade in the region. This has impeded the progress of regional economic integration and prevented the region from reaching its full</PARA>
<PARA>economic potential. Furthermore, by encouraging trade liberalisation on a regional basis, APEC can also encourage liberalisation at the global level. The success of the APEC leaders meeting in Seattle last year is considered to have had a positive influence on the outcome of the Uruguay Round at the end of the year. The Director-General of GATT, Peter Sullivan, has stated that efforts by APEC to liberalise trade on a regional basis are quite compatible with the aims of GATT and its successor, the World Trade Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also seen as highly valuable APEC's role in associating the United States in regional economic cooperation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about Bogor and beyond? The honourable member for Lilley did not mention anything about what the Bogor declaration contained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the success or otherwise of Bogor, one does not have to go any further than the last three days in the national newspapers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important question too often ducked by boosters is whether our motivation in putting so many of our cards on this particular table is genuinely strategic or just opportunistic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is definitely not the former.

Despite this, we are calling for free trade&mdash;at the earliest possible date.</PARA>
<PARA>On Tuesday, Louise Williams wrote an article for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which said:</PARA>

<PARA>Earlier today, my colleague the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) issued a media release on the matter. If the honourable member for Lilley is looking for some bipartisanship, here it is&mdash;but with a strong qualifier. The Leader of the National Party said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of the Bogor meeting is to take APEC another step forward, but if Australia is to bind with Asia in trade terms then we need to be as competitive as Asia, and our infrastructure needs to match best Asian practice.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we have been slow to introduce national trade and investment strategies that will assist our regional competitiveness;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Fischer added that an Australian definition of free trade was one based on open non-discriminatory multilateral trade.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, a lot has to be done between now and Osaka in 1995. Again, you need look no further than today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>, which highlights some of the differences of opinion amongst those who were there.

Well, they are not going to. I will quote from the Prime Minister's statement on the declaration, because it is a seminal summary. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bogor declaration charts an extraordinary new path for the region towards extraordinary new goals.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does Bogor mean for Australians? It means a more prosperous economy. It means a better lifestyle. It means not only more employment opportunities but also more interesting ones. It means wider horizons for our young people and more scope for them to exercise their skills as they learn the languages of a wider family and become part of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only business and industry will be challenged, but also education and culture.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a great achievement. The benefits for our economy, the benefits for employment and the benefits for trade are massively significant. The area will encompass more than two billion people by the turn of the century. It is estimated that it will represent 57 per cent of world trade. By 2020 seven of the 10 top economies in the world will belong to it and in Australian terms it is estimated that that means about $7 billion in extra income each year in extra trade. It is estimated to equate to about 70,000 new jobs. This is a region which comprises three-quarters of our exports and the estimates are that we will see a real income rise of 1.2 per cent and real output rise of 3.8 per cent. So this is a great achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is telling that the Prime Minister's efforts in this regard have been well recognised even before the achievement. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 27 October. The foreign editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Greg Sheridan, referring to a speech that the Prime Minister made in the run-up to the summit, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating last night tore down the boundaries between domestic and foreign policy and staked out his vision for Australia and the region for 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>He refers to a `most thoughtful speech' and goes on to describe `a deeply thoughtful and strategic contribution by the Prime Minister' that included `a vigorous and self-confident defence of Australia's approach'. That is the sort of praise we have seen on the speech. We have also had&mdash;as the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) said&mdash;the highly complimentary comment from former Liberal frontbencher Mr Ian Macphee. This is reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 15 November. Mr Macphee's contribution is referred to as `a glowing assessment of Paul Keating's Prime Ministership' and `an extraordinary assessment from a Liberal'. And that is just on the speech! Now that we have the achievement imagine the raps that we will get from the former Liberal shadow spokesman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what have we seen from those opposite when faced with the MPI today which seeks to recognise the achievement? A deafening silence or at best a churlish welcome. We search in vain to see where the opposition has set out its framework for APEC. I searched in vain for such comments. I was drawn to the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>, with contributions by many shadow spokespeople. This is said to be part of the fight back, part of the intellectual way back for the Liberal Party. So I searched through it for APEC. I found two references&mdash;two references!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reference was by Senator Hill, the Opposition Leader in the Senate. He is the bloke you tried to get down here but it did not quite work out. The section where he refers to APEC comes after the section entitled `the war against communism'. You can see that those opposite are still firmly rooted in the past. Senator Hill's contribution on APEC was to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fraser planted the seeds for today's APEC when, in conjunction with Japan's Prime Minister Ohira, he established the Pacific Economic Co-operation Council which continues today.</PARA>
<PARA>So Senator Hill's contribution, after the section `the war against communism', was to credit all this to Malcolm Fraser. Normally, opposition members credit it to Mr Menzies. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS> At least in that section of the book entitled `Australia's defence in the 1990s' by the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), he was honest enough not to try to credit this progress on APEC to either Fraser or Menzies. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia initiated the APEC group in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The group . . . is recognised as playing a major role in our economic future as a trading nation. In addition to the practical benefits which its trade facilitation policies are designed to produce, it provides a framework which offers Australia the opportunity to fully participate in the development of regional cooperation and economic integration strategies which are important factors in maintaining regional security.</PARA>
<PARA>At least he was honest enough to give credit where it is due. This book, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Heart of Liberalism</EMPHASIS>&mdash;and I am sorry to say to those opposite that there is no ticker in this contribution&mdash;is firmly placed in the context of defence and security. They are still wedded in the past. The heart of liberalism lives in the past. It has no ticker. The old arteries have hardened. You could not get oxygen through your policy if you were in an iron lung. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally, as I said, those opposite credit these things to Menzies. Let me refer to a contribution by the Prime Minister in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 28 October.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These days you will hear the Liberals say that, with Jack McEwen, Menzies pioneered our way in Asia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is Menzies could never fully appreciate what at least one newspaper of the time appreciated, namely, that "we are quite obviously a power whose destiny is linked irrevocably with Asia . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In this article, the Prime Minister makes the point that we on this side have dragged the tariff walls down; that we on this side have ensured that there is economic deregulation and that we are internationally competitive. All the big historic changes have been made by this side of the House. Those on the other side of the House have no capacity, no vision and no policy framework. They cannot even indicate to the Australian community the great benefits which will come from this historic achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having referred to Menzies, I conclude by drawing the attention of honourable members to the book by Gerard Henderson entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Menzies' Child</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the coalition have a proud record in terms of our relations with Asia&mdash;our relations with Asia have been flourishing for years&mdash;but it is important to remember that, as early as 1968, at the close of the Menzies period, no less than 65 per cent of Australia's total trade was with countries of the Asia-Pacific basin. If you look at the current situation, even though the volume of our trade with Asia has increased, our market share of trade with many Asian countries has dropped. In many ways, Australia counts for less in Asia today than it did 25 years ago. In many instances, our defence links are weaker.

Their hypocrisy is matched by that of their leader. It is interesting that the day the Prime Minister left to go to Bogor he said that he was not going to raise the subject of human rights in Indonesia but that he was going to raise the subject of an Australian republic. In other words, the purpose of his trip to Indonesia was not to criticise other countries for their real failings; it was to criticise Australia for our real strengths. He was prepared to talk about free trade, but he was not prepared to talk about a free East Timor. Quite frankly, our Prime Minister owed it to the memories of not only the hundreds of people who have been killed in Dili but also the five Australian journalists massacred in that city some years ago to have at least raised that subject on the most recent trip. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment ensures that the dependent spouse rebate on the with-child basis is maintained for those people who would have been ineligible for the government's new home child-care allowance. We identified a number of groups in this situation: families in which the child or the parent is overseas for longer than 13 weeks, families with dependent full-time students aged 18 to 25 when the child's income is under $1,785 a year, families disqualified from the home child-care allowance as a result of more onerous social security definitions and families with children who are receiving prescribed student payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The import of the amendments, which the government said would not be possible, is that the government will continue the dependent spouse rebate on a with-child basis for those families who would have been excluded from eligibility for the home child-care allowance and who previously had been eligible for the full rebate. It will also ensure that those who, because of Social Security's requirements, do not receive the full benefit that they were entitled to, will be able to obtain the dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, under the compromise, they will not be able to get the rebate until the end of the financial year so that the full eligibility against the home child-care allowance can be assessed. This seems to be a reasonable outcome. As part of the compromise in relation to this matter, the amount of the with-child dependent spouse rebate will no longer be indexed. I think it is a good outcome, an appropriate outcome. It demonstrates that what the government said could not be achieved was achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we are still in a situation where the government is telling us that it is through social security transfer payments that it is addressing the very significant problem of the poorest in the Australian community getting poorer and the rich getting richer. I do not think the unemployed, particularly unemployed couples, will be offering any thanks to the government that the rules in relation to the home child-care allowance were specifically developed to ensure that those families where both partners were unemployed and they had children would not be eligible for the home child-care allowance. Considering that they are the most needy and that the government maintains a regime from which they are excluded, I do not think there is any clearer indication that this government is not serious about addressing the problem of this tremendous difference between the poorest and the wealthiest in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's 13th report of 1994 deals with the proposed upgrading of accommodation at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>, New South Wales. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>, located on Sydney Harbour, is a major naval training establishment which carries out specialist warfare and navigation training for naval personnel. Most of the buildings were built in the 1950s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of new or upgraded living-in accommodation for 346 service personnel, additional office space and classrooms, improved recreation facilities and additional parking space. The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed at an estimated out-turn cost of $18.81 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After having inspected existing facilities at the base the committee was convinced that, if HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> is to remain as a major training establishment for the Navy, the standard of accommodation available for personnel must be improved, and shortfalls in the amount of accommodation available must be rectified. This applies to recreation and dining facilities as well, especially for junior and senior sailors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that some investment in training facilities has been made at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> in recent years and saw two excellent new training facilities during the inspection of the base. Nevertheless, a number of other essential training facilities are spread out, lack adequate space and should be upgraded or replaced to enable HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> to continue its role as a major naval training establishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inspection of the base the committee saw that the boundary of the Sydney Harbour National Park, which surrounds the base on three sides, has considerable exotic vegetation which Defence has offered to restore to more natural bushland. The committee has recommended that Defence should press the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service to accept the Defence offer to assist with the restoration of bushland in areas near the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary, which is currently in a poor state, adjacent to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>. At the public hearing a number of community groups expressed concern about the master planning of the base and the apparent visual intrusiveness of a number of new buildings which will be constructed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has taken these concerns on board and has recommended that: first, a consultative committee should be established to provide a forum for the exchange of views on planning and management matters affecting HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> and the local community; and, secondly, a number adjustments to various layouts and designs should be made, including the distance of the proposed junior officers' accommodation from the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary. Thirdly, the committee has suggested that, for future projects, baseline planning documents such as master plans should be prepared well in advance of proposals being referred to the committee&mdash;this will enable local planning authorities and community groups to provide comment and to be advised of general planning objectives well before specific work takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the overall scope of the upgrading of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> will be adequate to cater for known future requirements as Defence does not believe it will be necessary to undertake further development work at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Watson</EMPHASIS> for some time. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report was prepared for the committee by the former Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly. In tabling Mr Kelly's report I should make it clear that the committee stands by the principal finding in report 325 that there were serious deficiencies in the management and operation of the Australian Customs Service at the time of the Midford Paramount case. These deficiencies were also noted in the report of the Conroy review of the Customs Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelly's report has been prepared in response to recommendation 91 in the committee's report No. 325, which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Midford Paramount case and related matters</EMPHASIS>. This recommendation called on the Comptroller-General to review the levels, functions and suitability of the Australian Customs Service officers involved in the Midford case, together with the lines of responsibility and supervision, that were clearly inadequate according to the evidence before the committee. Mr Kelly's report was provided to the committee on 14 June 1994, under the cover of a letter from Mr Kelly's successor as Comptroller-General, Mr Lionel Woodward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall finding in Mr Kelly's report is that although the performance of a number of customs officers involved in the Midford case was flawed, `there is no evidence to support a case of fraud, dishonesty or illegal behaviour by any officer, and no basis has been found for the laying of any criminal charges'. I refer here to paragraph 153 of Mr Kelly's report. Furthermore, Mr Kelly concludes that `in no case have I considered it to be appropriate that disciplinary action should be taken against any officer still in the service'. I refer here to paragraph 155 of Mr Kelly's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has thought long and hard about whether or not to table Mr Kelly's report. In considering the matter we have met with Mr Woodward and sought and considered the views of all of the 15 people named in Mr Kelly's report. Although there are arguments to the contrary, the committee has decided to table the report in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has come to this decision for two reasons: first, because the inquiry which began this matter, the committee's inquiry into the Midford Paramount case, was a public inquiry; secondly, because of the strong representations made to us by most of the individuals named in the report, who believe that the tabling of the report provides them with an opportunity to clear their names. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another relevant consideration was advice the committee received from Mr Woodward that, on the basis of the information he has considered about the Midford case and the roles of the respective officers, he will not be taking any prosecution or disciplinary action against any officer named in Mr Kelly's report. I know that the Midford case and the subsequent reviews have been a difficult and unpleasant experience for some staff within the Customs Service. To these people I say, on behalf of the committee, that I note both Mr Kelly's conclusions and Mr Woodward's advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been pleased to see that since the tabling of the committee's report and the release of the Conroy review, significant steps have been taken to improve management, accountability and reporting systems within Customs. There are clear signs that lessons are being learned from the mistakes of the past. It is the committee's hope that the tabling of Mr Kelly's report will represent the final chapter in the Midford saga. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in the Senate there was a personal attack on me by Senator Murphy, who called into question my integrity in this House in relation to a matter of billboards at O'Halloran Hill in the electorate of Kingston. It was suggested that I had interfered with the construction of those billboards, which I happily admit I tried to. But he imputed motives to me which I certainly deny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was approached about these billboards because of my well-known connection with the environment. I was asked whether I thought it was appropriate that billboards be erected on two miles of green space at O'Halloran Hill and whether I could do something to prevent that sort of thing happening and prevent the further despoliation of our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contacted the staff at the local council who informed me that they did not want any billboards. They had not been approached and were they to be approached the billboards would not be allowed to be put up. I then contacted the CSIRO, which owned the land. It said that it had been approached by an individual who wished to put up billboards and it had agreed to a lease of those billboards. CSIRO informed me that it was allowed to do this and did not have to seek council approval because this was on Commonwealth land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to the CSIRO that I did not think it was appropriate that Commonwealth regulation should allow the CSIRO to put up billboards in what is a green space and that these were environmentally polluting. When the CSIRO said that it had not talked to any other company about it, but with an individual, I suggested that in these sorts of cases it should be made public and should go to tender. In his attack on me, Senator Murphy said:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reject that. When Mr Battersby rang and told me that he had small children and that he would lose money on the deal, I said to him that I felt great sympathy for him but that under no conditions did I support putting up billboards on open green space and that I would always be opposed to that. He said that he would be losing money and that he would be sued by those people he agreed to advertise for. At that stage I suggested that I could do nothing for him and that he should see a lawyer. I totally reject the imputation that I have some power over the CSIRO to change its commercial decisions. I totally reject any suggestions that I have acted improperly or otherwise than in the best interests of the environment in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise having had a delegation of students from Shoalhaven High School come to me after a school visit today. They were visiting Parliament House for legal studies and law in society. The Shoalhaven area, which is in my seat of Gilmore, is supplied with water from the Shoalhaven River. The Shoalhaven River has been used to augment Sydney water supplies of recent times. Large quantities of water have been sent to Sydney from our catchment area. The lower levels of water supplies available to the river and the industries along the river are causing some problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My students were somewhat concerned when they drove around Canberra during their visit and found that water sprinklers were on all day. They were concerned that not only were the sprinklers on all day but also many sprinklers were in fact watering roadways and pathways, et cetera. We hear a lot of things in this House about the drought and about the need to conserve water. These students have been absolutely upset by what they believed to be a flagrant disregard for the conservation of water in this city. In line with what is happening in my electorate, water authorities have requested ordinary folk to be conservation minded in their use of water and for these students to come to the national capital and see a flagrant misuse of water was somewhat disturbing. I promised them that I would bring this to the attention of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that vast sums of money be spent in the Shoalhaven area on a dam called the Welcome Reef Dam, locally known as the unwelcome reef dam, which will significantly effect the supplies of water to the Shoalhaven catchment area and which will significantly affect the ability of the river to function in an ecological fashion to sustain the biodiversity which it currently sustains. I have two major industries in my electorate that take large quantities of water from that river: Australian Paper Mills, now known as Australia Paper, and Manildra Starches. The students who visited Canberra are concerned that if there is no concern about water conservation amongst the people in Canberra, the centre of where so much is said about the drought, then what example is this place setting for the rest of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate the people, and particularly the school children, have rallied around to support all forms of assistance to the drought affected farmers. They find it somewhat disturbing that similar sorts of actions cannot take place here. Just recently there was talk in the ACT Legislative Assembly of culling kangaroos because a lack of water was driving them towards the roadsides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACT community should get its act together when other people throughout this country are in the grips of a drought and asking for people to be conservation minded. But it should not happen just because we are in a drought. Conserving water is ecologically sustainable. If people do the right thing and conserve water they will ensure that we do not have to expend large amounts of infrastructure money on dams that we do not need. I ask the people of Canberra to take note of what is happening in the rest of the country and set a good example. My students should not have to come up here and see such flagrant waste. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the disgraceful and cynical misuse of taxpayers' funds on the part of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. In order to enhance his own credibility, he has funded a number of highly questionable green organisations to produce unobjective and biased reports to back up his point of view in the cabinet room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With several woodchip licences up for renewal, Senator Faulkner is keen to make his presence felt and have his way in the cabinet room brawls with the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). So the minister provided $100,000 to conservationists to produce a report on forest areas of high conservation value. These groups came back with a wish list of virtually every forest currently used for logging purposes to be closed down. The peak industry body, NAFI, was given three days to respond, but Senator Faulkner and others are now using the predictable and unscientific findings of the report to support an end to the logging in these areas and cabinet intervention in the woodchip licence approval process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Taxpayers' money went to the environment minister to enable him to commission one-eyed reports that would provide him with greater credibility. An amount of $166,000 was paid to Environment Victoria to report on timber plantations in Australia. This duplicates the work already done by the National Plantations Advisory Committee, the Resource Assessment Commission and the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Forest Use. All reports have concluded that an end of logging operations in native forests is neither possible nor even desirable. These inquiries have been very broad and received input from unions, industry and conservation groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Minister Faulkner did not like the results, so he commissioned his own report. Instead of calling for submissions or tendering out the job so that all consultants might apply, he hand-picked a group called Environment Victoria to do the job. But this time he knows that Environment Victoria will reach his conclusions because it is already on the record as saying, `We can get all the wood we need from plantations. There is more than enough timber in Australia's plantations'. It is pretty clear that this group will produce a report which overestimates the size of plantations and recommends an overnight cessation of logging in native forests. The unions were less than impressed with the latest grant. Bob Richardson, of the ACTU, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Faulkner is wasting public money in a shameless exercise to capture the green vote.</PARA>
<PARA>Chris Northover, of the CFMEU, had this to add:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government must cease this nonsensical waste of public funds and face up to its commitment to address forestry issues.</PARA>
<PARA>The member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) and the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland)&mdash;ALP members from Victoria&mdash;have expressed similar sentiments. Robert Bain, the executive director of the National Association of Forest Industries, wrote to the minister expressing concern and inviting a reply. That was six weeks ago, and no reply has arrived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is Environment Victoria? Officially, it does not exist. It is not a company that reports to the ASC or an incorporated association in the state of Victoria. It is not even a registered business name. So Senator Faulkner has given $200,000 to a phantom organisation. There is no official record of its existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A close look at its propaganda leaflets reveals that it shares the same address as the Conservation Council of Victoria. The CCV has received around $900,000 in federal government funding in the last six years. But, as at August this year, it had not submitted an annual return for three years. It used to be a company reporting to the ASC, but it then decided to wind up as a company and become an association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reporting requirements for associations are not quite so strict. But it could not even comply with them. It has received $900,000 worth of funding over six years, but it could not complete any annual returns for a three-year period. These are the standards of accountability for which the environment portfolio is becoming famous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What hope do taxpayers have of monitoring government expenditure when the government gives grants to bodies that go under assumed and unregistered names and refuse to submit their annual returns? What do they spend their government grants on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, Environment Victoria spent a $33,000 federal grant on producing and distributing a leaflet which made out the timber industry to be nothing short of an environmental rapist. Some incredible propaganda is contained within it. Some pictures of cuddly animals are accompanied by text which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the woodchippers come, the animals . . . haven't got a chance. When the trees are clear-felled, many of them are crushed . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The leaflet was placed in letterboxes around marginal electorates in Melbourne. It was paid for by the taxpayer. It is a complete sham and a clear abuse and misuse of taxpayers' funds to provide money to a group that is going by an assumed name, thumbing its nose at accountability requirements and spending taxpayers' dollars for blatant political propaganda. This is really a sports rorts type of business. The minister is funding shady interest groups for blatant political purposes to produce predictable and biased reports that back up his own point of view. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about the fragile and beautiful area between Lake Macquarie and the sea that must be protected and improved for future young Australians. I would like to see it made a conservation area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the last 60 years, the area has been ravaged and raped by miners below ground. It was acquired for underground mining, not surface land development. The mines have been closed down, and BHP owns most of the land. In latter years, it has been beach mined on top, so dunes as high as 200,000 feet that abut the back of the beach have gone. Some of that sand is over in Hawaii. If you go to Waikiki, you will lay on sand from my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sand has gone. The area is debauched. Car bodies have been dumped there. The only way to improve this area is to let BHP develop it under a Belmont Sands project to provide 1,200 homes, tourism and shopping facilities on the land, much of which is almost below sea level. It is very low and delicate, with a few dunes and hillocks. If that land were in its natural state, no-one would dare ever suggest that a house or commercial enterprise be placed upon it. It is a vital and delicate area between Lake Macquarie and the sea. We as a community have enjoyed this area for the last 60 years. In hundreds of years, Australia's future generations should have the chance to enjoy it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to the south there is another big strip of land. Similarly, the land from Catherine Hill Bay north to Wallarah Peninsula has been acquired by CRA for underground mining of the glorious headlands. It is part of the natural features of the coast. Obviously, CRA is lining up to try to develop that land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adjacent to that to the north is a development called the Pinny Beach Resort. It started off in 1988 and ran through an independently controlled council. There was a proposal for 1,200 homes&mdash;which has now become 4,000 homes&mdash;golf courses and hotels. It was a massive residential project by a developer from Surfers Paradise that masqueraded as a tourist project. It was going to bring thousands of jobs. It has done none of those things, and now it is simply being converted into a residential development on headlands and rainforests that<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">should never have been touched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That whole coastal strip&mdash;I am sure it is a similar situation in your electorate, Mr Speaker&mdash;all the way north, right through to Merewether is being debauched or gnawed away at by development projects. Much of it is now being attacked on the basis of, `It's only this little bit. It's only 60 homes. It isn't very much. It doesn't really affect it.' It does, but there is no proper control and the council does not really have the power to protect the greater entity of that coastal zone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the member for Paterson, I want to see a moratorium on all of that land&mdash;right down the coast, right down to your area, Mr Speaker&mdash;until some comprehensive policy is set down that is not dollar driven. All that is happening at the moment is that, if you are lucky enough to find somebody who has some land, whatever its existing use, and you get hold of that land and then put up little projects&mdash;60 homes, not too many&mdash;you will get away with it. That has to stop. I believe that young Australians of the future have to have the same opportunity as previous generations have had to enjoy the beauty, the quality and the surf that is Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, several miles of the beach are owned by BHP. Some people are saying, `Don't make too many waves about this because BHP mightn't give us the beach back.' I cannot see a situation where major corporations like CRA or BHP would be putting a barbed wire fence up and saying, `You can't go on the beach because we own it.' I would like to see BHP leave, hand the whole area back and have it restored. There is range of programs such as the one billion trees program, the proposed coast care program, the land environment action program and employment programs. All those would help to provide the funds to do for some restoration. I commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With lightning speed, the International Wool Secretariat put out a statement to say I was incorrect. Actually it said that in the first paragraph and then it spent the next seven paragraphs confirming virtually everything I have said. As well, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> last week, the International Wool Secretariat tried to defend delays with the usual lines of, `We can't tell you because it's all too secret.'

What I do know is that, yet again, wool growers have missed out, maybe much more than they realise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the words of the International Wool Secretariat, the new process is now going to Northern Hemisphere partners. But there was an Australian interest, which got knocked back about two years ago. The IWS has admitted as much and has now said that it is dealing with overseas companies. This is for a process for which a prototype was built before 1990. But the story gets worse. The IWS admits that not all patents are finalised yet. If the process was worked out so long ago the alarm bells go off! It raises very serious concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three points: the delays have cost wool growers a small fortune; there are serious concerns as to what really is going on, particularly as to why the delays; and it seems that the patents are still to be finalised.

This is a very serious matter, not only on the specific issue but also because it highlights the wider problem of excellent research that is done in Australia which is not being converted and is all too often lost overseas. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In 1989 the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, was approached by the Australian Federal Police Association with its suggestions for some changes to be made to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. In response, he undertook to have a review of the act conducted by a working group composed of representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police Association was also closely involved in the development of the proposal, although it was not a formal member of the working group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That working group was established in mid-1991. In consultation with the AFPA, it considered proposals from all interested parties, as well as the reports of both the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's review of the ombudsman's office. Agreement was reached on a number of proposals and the resulting amendments are presented in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the first review of the complaints act since its commencement over a decade ago, and many of the amendments before the Committee are intended only to make minor adjustments to its operation which will smooth out some of the practical difficulties which have emerged over that time. However, there are some more substantial changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major amendment concerns the coverage of AFP staff members by the complaints act. The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 established a unified AFP work force in which all AFP employees are able to undertake duties which would previously have been allocated according to whether the employee was a member of the AFP&mdash;that is, a sworn police officer&mdash;or a member of the Australian Public Service. The resulting trend towards use of staff members rather than members in situations where police powers are not required increases the likelihood of staff members being the subject of complaints&mdash;which would be dealt with in accordance with public service procedures. This bill will provide for members and staff members to be covered in the same complaints regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major amendment involves the creation of two new offences. The first of these consists of making false statements or giving false information about action taken by an AFP appointee. The corresponding penalty is equivalent to the penalty for misleading the ombudsman under section 44 of the complaints act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the creation of this offence is that there have been situations where persons charged with an offence have made extremely serious allegations against innocent appointees in an attempt to draw attention away from themselves or to hinder an investigation. In other cases, people might make false complaints for vindictive or vexatious reasons. This needs to be discouraged, as such complaints have a real impact on the officers concerned, as well as wasting the AFP's limited financial and other resources . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is aware that there is some risk inherent in the creation of this offence. Genuine complainants might be deterred through fear of prosecution, or worse, an officer about whom a legitimate complaint has been made might be tempted to retaliate by bringing a charge against the complainant. To prevent this, a charge of making a false complaint will not be able to be made unless the ombudsman has firstly consented to the proceedings. If the ombudsman's consent is not forthcoming, the Attorney-General will ultimately decide whether to bring proceedings. This external control is seen as a safeguard to ensure that the section is not used capriciously against complainants, and to protect the complainant from any possible intimidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a second offence is created whereby anyone who threatens or harms another person because of that person's involvement&mdash;or someone else's involvement&mdash;in an investigation under the act can be prosecuted for victimisation. It is expected that the simultaneous introduction of these two offences will provide adequate protection for innocent persons while minimising the risk of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third major amendment proposed by this bill concerns investigations initiated by the ombudsman of his or her own motion. From time to time the ombudsman will become aware of a matter which could justify a complaint but which has not been the subject of one. Under this act as it stands, the ombudsman has no power to initiate an investigation unless a complaint has been made. This amendment is designed to allow own-motion investigations under the complaints act when they are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fourth significant change, which entails a number of minor amendments, relates to the admissibility of evidence obtained by the ombudsman. At present, such evidence is not admissible in disciplinary proceedings. Although this is consistent with the ombudsman's wider role, it is inconsistent with the role of independent investigator which the ombudsman fills under the complaints act, and will bring the ombudsman's provisions into line with the admissibility of evidence obtained by the internal investigation division of the AFP. Investigation by the ombudsman under the act is a last resort and if it is to have real credibility it is necessary that the evidence obtained in the course of such investigations be made admissible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final major amendment focuses on the procedure for the hearing of minor disciplinary charges to which an officer charged pleads guilty. At present, a member who recognises that he or she has made a relatively minor mistake may be subjected to the penalty of prolonged uncertainty, because often the disciplinary tribunal will not be convened until a more serious case arises. The proposed amendment allows such cases to be dealt with by the commissioner, where the ombudsman agrees, instead of the tribunal. It is designed to eliminate unnecessary delays under the present procedure while providing guarantees that the procedure adopted does not improperly protect the police. The matter can be referred to the tribunal for penalty by the commissioner if the ombudsman agrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This opportunity has also been taken to make a number of minor amendments, including changes to the conciliation procedure to reflect the consolidation of ranks in the AFP, extension of the ombudsman's discretion not to investigate trivial complaints to ensure that limited resources are concentrated on more serious matters, and the removal of sexist terminology in those parts of the act where gender neutral language has not already been introduced. Other small adjustments are designed simply to replace procedures which have turned out to be practically inconvenient with more efficient methods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that the amendments contained in this bill will bring about a significant improvement in the day-to-day operation of the complaints act while removing or replacing those provisions which, because of changes in the structure of the AFP work force over the past decade, no longer have a policy basis. The bill demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to the implementation, wherever possible, of recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and more generally to ensuring the accountability of public officials, including the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments have no financial impact. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is my first address in this chamber, Mr Deputy Speaker, and, having been a policeman for nine years, I have some sympathy with the role of police officers in the increasingly complex and difficult milieu in which they work. Of course, one can refer back to Gilbert and Sullivan's famous light opera the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pirates of Penzance</EMPHASIS> for the famous line `A policeman's lot is not a happy one, happy one.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill comes some considerable length after the initial requests. The amendments come from the working group which was put together back in 1989 and, at the request of the Australian Federal Police Association, which had made a number of representations to the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, the working group proposed a number of amendments to the principal act. In December 1990, the minister wrote to the AFPA indicating that a number of its proposals, together with the other suggested amendments to the principal act, would be considered in a general review of the principal act which should have been completed during 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This review, which commenced in 1991 in May and reported in October 1991, included in the working group representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the AFP, the AFPA, the ombudsman's office and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. A number of proposals were recommended by the working group and, of course, they found their way eventually into this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some concerns in relation to the bill. One of those concerns is the manner in which the review of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 has been undertaken since its inception. As I mentioned, these current amendments being implemented stem from a request of the Australian Federal Police Association made in April 1989. A working party review was not commenced until 1991, after it was indicated that the AFPA concerns would be addressed as part of the review of the act as a whole. Now, more than five years after the original request made by the AFPA, the government has finally introduced its legislation, and this seems an extraordinary delay indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we have been informed by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) that he has approved another wholesale review of the act. We can only infer that the initial review took so long to implement that its results are now out of date before they have even been implemented. This situation is obviously less acceptable for the Australian Federal Police officers who are governed by this act, employees and members of the public who are also affected by the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has supported the bill in the Senate, but it had it referred the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. This was done because of the following concerns raised by the Law Council of Australia. Firstly, the Law Council of Australia agreed that evidence taken before an ombudsman should be admissible but that there should also be a corresponding obligation on the prosecution of disclosure of such material in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to that particular comment, there should be a converse rule that the complaint and any statement made by the complainant be privileged from production in proceedings relating to separate criminal charges against the complainant, except clause 6, which relates to false complaints. Otherwise there would be a severe disincentive from making complaints against police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, in relation to clause 6, which creates the new offence of making a false complaint or giving false information, the suggestion is made that there be a requirement, before a conviction can be sustained, that the charge should be corroborated. The Law Council suggested that this would be no different from a charge of perjury, which requires corroboration and for which the policy consideration justifying the requirement of independent confirmation is the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was expressed about the ability of the Australian Federal Police to launch prosecutions under clause 6. Even though they are apparently required to consult the ombudsman in respect of such prosecutions, there is no obligation to take the advice given. The Law Council believes that before a prosecution can be launched it should positively require the consent of the ombudsman and it should be independently prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. In the committee report, the coalition, by a dissenting report, recommended that clause 6 be reviewed so that, should the ombudsman object to any prosecution for false complaint or for providing false information in relation to a complaint, the matter can be referred to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, apart from that particular point, the coalition supports the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill and acknowledges the purpose for which these particular amendments were constructed. This was obviously to eliminate anomalies and to meet practical concerns arising out of operations of the act since its commencement and the introduction of the new AFP rank structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major amendments, as has been noted by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), are to extend its coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff, whose exclusion from the complaints act regime is no longer justified by differential allocation of duties to members and staff members under clause 2 definitions, and we certainly have no problem with that particular change. It also creates two new offences, making a false complaint or giving false information&mdash;clause 6 and section 19&mdash;and victimisation of a complainant or a person assisting in the investigation of a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary in his address acknowledged that in this modern era of police investigations, particularly in relation to the complex and often very serious criminal matters that are investigated by the Australian Federal Police, there are naturally going to be times when a suspect or an accused person is going to be trying very hard to use the complaints system to either delay or impede an investigation which could well result in a conviction. We have seen in recent times a burgeoning of complaints in relation to the operations of police investigations, and these have, I think, been somewhat encouraged to a certain extent by some of the judiciary. That has meant that, for instance, people who have very serious charges levelled against them have been able to delay and slow down the prosecution process accordingly, and that has made things difficult in relation to the marshalling of witnesses in a particular case. One of the most difficult jobs for an AFP investigator, or any other police investigator, for that matter, is to ensure that the witnesses are marshalled for the case when it is eventually prosecuted in court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In cases where one has serious drug offences which may involve hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential proceeds for the criminals, that means that witnesses, particularly if they come from the drug trafficking milieu, are likely to feel somewhat intimidated by the length of time it takes to get to a prosecution. If a smart criminal or person who has been accused has some aptitude for creating the circumstances for a complaint, that may slow down an investigation or make it more difficult for the AFP investigators to be able to retain that witness's potential participation in the case. It may impede the eventual conviction or the objective of eventually convicting the offenders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third change is to provide for investigation by the ombudsman's own motion of action by a member or staff member of the AFP. The fourth change is to make evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of investigation admissible in disciplinary hearings&mdash;clause 11, amending existing section 27&mdash;and to abolish the requirement that hearings of complaint-raised disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. The option of a tribunal hearing where the public interest requires it is actually retained&mdash;clause 16, new part VA, section 52A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are minor amendments to the changes to the rank requirements for conciliators in complaint cases&mdash;clause 3, conciliation. We certainly do not have any problems with that. There is an extension of the ombudsman's discretion to determine that a complaint should not be investigated where he or she is satisfied that it is trivial&mdash;clause 9 amending existing section 24. There are adjustments to penalty provisions to bring them into line with current policy so that monetary and time penalties are changed to unit penalties&mdash;schedule 3&mdash;and the removal of sexist terminology which is a process that is being undertaken in many parts of our Commonwealth legislation, even, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, in our own standing orders. That has been something that has been recently&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police ministers of South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and the Northern Territory see no significant differences in the treatment of complaints against the AFP, if this bill is passed, and their own state complaints procedures. I understand the AFPA, which was involved with the interdepartmental working group, agrees with the amendments. I have already raised the concerns the coalition had that were raised by the Law Council of Australia. I will not go into further detail. Of course, we have heard from the parliamentary secretary that there is no financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, we have had the matter referred back from the Senate committee with a committee report with a dissenting report recommending that clause 6 be reviewed so that, should the ombudsman object to any prosecution for false complaint or for providing false information in relation to complaint, the matter should then be referred to the Attorney-General. I suppose this comes at a difficult time in relation to Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements. Those who have an interest in that area would obviously have been following with some interest the actions of the federal government after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements</EMPHASIS>. Those are going to amount to some very significant changes in relation to the role of the Australian Federal Police and the NCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go into that Commonwealth law enforcement arrangements review report, I will look at the mission function that is stated in it for the Australian Federal Police. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Federal Police . . . was established by the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 . . . which was proclaimed on 19 October 1979. Section 8 of that Act provides for the AFP to perform the following functions:</PARA>

<PARA>One of the key recommendations of this particular report, something to which these amendments to the act are going to have some relevance, is the change to the staffing resources of the NCA and the proposed strategic alliance between the NCA and the AFP. Under the section relating to the National Crime Authority, at paragraph 18.26, the review report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Chapter 7 of the Report the Review recommends the retention of the NCA as a stand-alone strategic and co-ordinating body of State and Commonwealth agencies, to regulate, deter and bring to justice those engaged in organised crime. The Review argues that the NCA, appropriately tasked and resourced, is in the best position to achieve these aims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In paragraph 18.27, it then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Review recommends the following changes to the NCA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Expansion of projects being undertaken by the NCA to those listed in Chapter 7.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a menu of particular investigative targets or objects that would be set and reviewed by the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, the new agency or the new board that has been recommended to be set up as a result of this review report. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Consideration be given to legislatively confining the NCA to the type of role defined in Chapter 7.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Formation of a strategic alliance between the NCA and the AFP. A high proportion of NCA investigators should be officers of the AFP and technical and other services of the two organisations should be integrated as far as possible. It is anticipated that savings of $7-8m per annum can be achieved through integration of AFP and NCA corporate support, Police Technical Unit-type functions, and information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Implementation of the Review's suggested staff and resource structure for the NCA . . . The Review recommends that the Government request the NCA Chairperson to indicate within three months the staff changes and savings which might accrue as a result of these recommendations . . . The Review also recommends that the NCA be required to proceed in the direction of these recommendations, which include negotiation of an arrangement with the AFP for appropriate officers of the NCA to become members of the AFP and for the investigative resources of the NCA to come from the AFP in the future (except for those which come from relevant State police forces). The recommendations also provide for adjustments to the other staff of the NCA for future needs as defined in the recommendations. The issue of NCA Cost Sharing is dealt with in Chapter 16.</PARA>
<PARA>When the working group was looking at the minor amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act, this was not envisaged. The fact that there will be collocation, and the fact that NCA officers will become sworn AFP officers in certain circumstances, gives a different spin to the changes that are being proposed by the government in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, it was certainly not envisaged at the time when the working group was formulating this report that the NCA would be collocated or have a strategic alliance with the NCA. So there is some concern. I am echoing the concerns that have been registered by senior staff members and other staff members of the NCA. Certainly, as a former investigator, I also have some concerns about whether this particular legislation might impede NCA investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, there might be the situation where a person with a smart brief might well decide that in order to impede what may be a very high level NCA investigative effort, he will start making complaints against NCA and AFP officers who are both, presumably, governed by the AFP Act. The actual arrangements, I understand, have yet to be finally thrashed out. This is a tumultuous period for members of the AFP and also for the personnel of the NCA because there is still a fair amount of instability and insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these concerns were registered at the public hearing of the NCA joint statutory committee&mdash;the parliamentary joint committee of which I am a member&mdash;a couple of weeks ago. Very serious concern was expressed about the morale of the NCA personnel because of these changes. In particular, there were very serious concerns about the continuing independence of the NCA. As a member of the PJC, I am very concerned about that. One of the things that was integral to the creation of the NCA was the fact that it would be an independent body that would essentially be acting upon the references given to it by the intergovernmental committee, which consists of attorneys-general, justice ministers or police ministers from the various states, and the federal justice minister and the federal Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a tilting away from what I consider to be the best role for the National Crime Authority as an independent body with references given to it by the intergovernmental committee to its role as a body that is now going to have collocated AFP personnel and, of course, information sharing. NCA officers will now be sworn AFP officers and, under certain circumstances, will be governed by the amendments that are being made to the act. There are also the concerns of the staff of the NCA, as I have already mentioned, about the future integrity and independence of the NCA's investigative efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the change in emphasis from the intergovernmental committee to the CLEB, the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, there will be some changes to the nature of the investigation of objects or targets. We have already seen in the report a list of various organised criminal objects or targets, amongst which are the Yakuza gangs, outlawed motorcycle gangs, paedophile networks and the like. Essentially, these lists would be determined or adjusted or updated by the CLEB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also involved in that, and this is a difficult matter, is the fact that the chairperson of the NCA, Mr Sherman, also chairs the CLEB. In my view, there is a potential there for a conflict of interest between his role as the chairperson of the NCA, the first officer of the NCA, and his role as the Chairman of the Commonwealth Law Enforcement Board, which has a distinctly different role from that of the National Crime Authority. The independence of the NCA, and its separation from the AFP, something that I think we should have maintained, will be of more concern in the future. As I have indicated, we have already had registered with us, by senior members of the staff, very serious concerns as to the future of the style of the NCA and the type of investigations it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am someone who believes that the value of the NCA was enhanced by the fact that it was created not only in Commonwealth law but also in the various state statutes, which enables there to be an NCA within each state. I think the changes are a matter of concern to those of us who believed in the arrangements with the intergovernmental committee, even though they were not perfect and from time to time certainly did not work particularly well. It seems strange that the federal Labor government, marooned in a sea of Liberal state governments, wants to change away from what was seen to be a reasonable arrangement, and one that allowed for a fair amount of involvement on the part of the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some criticisms that because the AFP is subject to much more direction from the ministerial level than the NCA&mdash;the NCA has an independence&mdash;and because of involvement in the strategic alliance, the collocation and the co-staffing, the NCA's independence may well be infringed through the ability of the minister to be able to issue directives, et cetera. The NCA's independence could also be infringed through what I consider to be a potential conflict of interest with this matter of the chairperson of the NCA also being the chairperson of the CLEB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the concluding part of my address I come to a matter that is of concern in my electorate. I would hate to be parochial, but it was mentioned in the explanatory memorandum that the Australian Federal Police has a much more substantial or increasing role in detecting frauds against the Commonwealth, particularly in areas where welfare payments or social security payments are at stake. That starts to involve the AFP in areas that are much greyer than, say, the more open-and-shut criminal cases of people trafficking in drugs, importing drugs or whatever. It certainly means that there are going to be some serious situations for AFP investigative officers and, in particular, for those people who are subjected to investigations through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strawberry grower in my electorate was visited&mdash;I suppose I could say euphemistically that he received a visit, but in fact it was a raid&mdash;by the Australian Federal Police and by Australian Taxation Office personnel on 27 November 1991, between 4.30 and 5.30 in the morning, at the height of the strawberry growing season. Approximately 25 officers of the ATO and the AFP raided properties in Carabooda, in my electorate. For those who are not familiar with that area, it is one where there has been a very important niche market for export strawberries. We have a $5 million export market from the area. The difficulty is that growing strawberries and other fruit and vegetables involves seasonal labour. This is the rub for employers who are trying to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People employed in the seasonal vegetable and fruit industry come, in some cases, from South-East Asian backgrounds. The reason is often that they have experience from their previous homeland in fruit and vegetable growing activities. They have a natural affinity for it. In many cases they work for a period of time, set themselves up on their own farm and then become successful fruit and vegetable growers in their own right. In my area we have had some examples of very successful growers who have come to the country virtually penniless, worked hard and then managed to create the circumstances in which they can establish their own farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, the difficulty arises for an employer trying to do the right thing. We should bear in mind the requirements of the statutes, including the tax act, and requirements in employer declarations and the like. Under the tax file number system there are certain privacy requirements, and there is a 28-day period in which an employee can lodge the form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the Australian Federal Police, acting as far as we can see quite lawfully and obviously pursuing inquiries that had been referred to them by the Australian Taxation Office, executed search warrants on my constituent's farm at the height of the strawberry season. I note that a bill to be debated later talks about cultural influence. Because of some cultural differences on the part of some of the casual workers, after the raid the majority of them left the property and would not return. In fact, on 28 November, the next day, only a handful returned to work. On 29 and 30 November, none of them returned to work. As a result of the shortage in labour, approximately 70 per cent of my constituent's strawberry crop could not be picked. The fruit overripened and became unmarketable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the raid on the farm, nine casual workers were charged and convicted of 12 offences under the Taxation Administration Act. Again I am not suggesting that somehow this was unlawful or unwarranted. The difficulty occurs where somebody is conducting a lawful business but something has given rise to a suspicion that people there may be defrauding the Commonwealth or involved in offences which amount to the same thing, and where the Australian Federal Police feel obliged to use search warrants and a raid to obtain evidence. As a result of this, the person conducting that lawful business may suddenly find himself or herself considerably out of pocket. The difficulty is that there is little or nothing the person can do about it, so long as that warrant is right. I see my learned colleague opposite, the Member for Banks (Mr Melham), nodding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a man who has spent some time as a public defender, he would know&mdash;as I would know, as a former detective&mdash;that, if the warrant is lawful, there is really precious little people can do about the fact that it may well have interfered substantially with their day-to-day trade. That is a difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am saying that, as the involvement of the AFP evolves more substantially into these more grey areas&mdash;where one is dealing with frauds against the Commonwealth, some of which may involve, in the case of employers, things which are, because of other constraints and legislation, quite difficult to actually detect on the part of the employer&mdash;people have a problem in that they have really got nowhere they can go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I would like to alert the minister&mdash;perhaps the acting parliamentary secretary opposite can alert him&mdash;to the fact that there ought to be a review, or perhaps an inquiry, into the way in which citizens can redress problems such as those created by the raids that were undertaken in Carabooda in 1991 on my constituent's farm, as a result of which he lost about $1 1/2 million worth of strawberry crop. The person who, in fact, alerted the community to these particular problems with casual labour&mdash;in public, in the newspapers&mdash;became subject to the raid himself, lost a considerable amount of money and has nowhere he can go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will conclude. Other than those changes that were proposed by the Law Council, the coalition supports the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite often, I think, the Australian community looks at members of parliament and at the shambles that question time often appears to be, and considers that, in all matters, we tend to be confrontationist, and that, on both sides of politics, we are very often simply unable to agree. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendments Bill 1994 is one of those very many cases in which it is pretty clear that this parliament works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was introduced, by the government, into the Senate, and there was a debate there. There were some suggested amendments, and there was some consultation with the community. The bill was referred to a Senate committee, which brought down a report and a minority report which, basically, made certain suggestions as to how the bill could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has picked up some of those suggestions, with the result that we now have an amended bill before the Committee. If it is carried in this place and in the other place, we certainly will find that the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill 1994, when it becomes law, will be a very much better piece of legislation than it would have been had it not gone through the processes that I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also consulted the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Federal Police Association. The bill amends the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981, an act which governs the handling of complaints made, whether by members of the public or by Australian Federal Police members, against the Australian Federal Police and its members, including disciplinary measures consequent on a complaint and all disciplinary appeals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australia of 1994, where there is a very great desire to make sure that agencies of government are accountable, it is clearly important that proper procedures are in place so that one is able to make a complaint against an officer of the police force, or an officer of some other government agency, who breaches the regulations on procedures. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of royal commissions and inquiries, not only in the Commonwealth sphere, but also in the state sphere over the last 10 years, shows that it is very important to make sure that we have that accountability. It is also very important to seek the right sort of balance. If we come down too heavily against the police, we will find that the police will not be able to do their duty, and, if we do not have adequate procedures which will enable genuine complaints to be investigated, the public will lose confidence, not only in the administration of the police services, but in the administration of justice</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland there is a problem. We have a situation where, when police receive complaints, in many cases they are frightened to carry out their duty, because, if they approach a person who is suspected of being an offender, that person will immediately threaten them with the Criminal Justice Commission. We have had instances where police officers who were simply trying to do their job, trying to protect society, have, in effect, been turned into the criminals. They have been dragged down before a committee of three police inspectors and shoved in front of a video camera. Quite often, therefore, police are saying that, unless it is a very serious complaint, it is simply not worth the hassle. If young people get drunk in the main streets of some towns or cities, if there is obscene language here and there, or if a bit too much noise is being made, it is now very difficult in Queensland to get the police service to go out and investigate those complaints, because police are simply not prepared to have their reputations and careers destroyed, or placed in doubt, as a result of a spurious complaint to the CJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one matter that the Queensland government is going to have to look at. Under this legislation we are trying to bring forward a fair, reasonable and balanced procedure to make sure that, on the one hand, complaints against the federal police are investigated appropriately, but, on the other hand, police are still able to carry out the very important duty that they do for the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments arise out of the report of an interdepartmental working group, which was established in mid-1991. This group was comprised of representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Federal Police. In consultation with the Australian Federal Police Association, the working group considered proposals by all interested parties, as well as the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the review of the ombudsman's office by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced the amendments now before the committee in order to eliminate anomalies and to meet practical concerns arising out of the operation of the act since its commencement and the introduction of the new Australian Federal Police rank structure. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) has pointed out, there are a number of amendments to the legislation, both major and minor. The major amendments are to extend the act's coverage to include non-sworn AFP staff, whose exclusion from the complaints regime is no longer justified by differential allocation of duties to members and staff members. This is contained in the definition section, clause 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the federal area, as indeed in state police services, over the years we have had two groups of people working on behalf of the community. On the one hand, we have sworn police officers; on the other, we have had public servants. I suppose there has been a tendency by governments on both sides of the political spectrum to involve public servants more and more in performing roles which do not require the use of police powers. So if we look at the duties carried out by Public Service members today, many of these would be duties which 10 or 20 years ago would have been the prerogative of sworn police officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The natural result of this is that the kinds of complaints that used to arise against police officers when carrying out those duties are indeed now sheeted home to these members of the Public Service. The government has quite accurately identified the need to ensure that complaints procedures against public servants who are carrying out duties which traditionally have been police duties are the same procedures in essence as those which would be followed if a police officer were carrying out the duties and had done what was complained of. The bill also seeks to create two new offences: making a false complaint or giving false information&mdash;clause 6, proposed new section 19; and victimisation of a complainant or a person assisting in the investigation of a complaint&mdash;clause 19, proposed new section 88A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also provide for investigations by the ombudsman's own motion&mdash;very important, in my view&mdash;of action by a member of, or staff member of, the AFP&mdash;clause 7, proposed new section 21A. The amendments also are to make evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation admissible in disciplinary hearings&mdash;clause 11, amending existing section 27&mdash;and to abolish the requirement that hearings of complaint based disciplinary charges be held before the disciplinary tribunal where the appointee charged pleads guilty. Most importantly, the option of a tribunal hearing where the public interest requires it is retained&mdash;clause 16, proposed new part 5A, section 52A. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these major amendments to the legislation, there are, as I said before, a number of minor amendments. These relate to changes to the rank requirements for conciliators in complaint cases&mdash;clause 3, conciliation&mdash;an extension of the ombudsman's discretion to determine that a complaint should not be investigated where he or she is satisfied that it is trivial&mdash;clause 9 amending section 24. I think this is important because quite often one finds that people might bring forward a complaint which is obviously not a complaint of substance but the person bringing forward the complaint might be someone who is facing very serious charges, and what this person might be seeking to do is to bring in procedural inhibitions to the law carrying out its usual pursuit of the conduct for which the person is being charged. The last thing that anyone in this place would want would be for a person to be able to use technicalities to impede the prosecution of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the minor amendments also are adjustments to penalty provisions to bring them into line with current policy so that monetary and time penalties are changed to unit penalties&mdash;schedule 3. Of course, as we have inflation over the years&mdash;and under this Labor government we have had very high inflation for a very large number of years&mdash;quite often the penalties under legislation appear to be quite trivial. In a lot of the criminal codes, admittedly state legislation, one finds that a person could well be fined the sum of #1. At the time that these criminal codes were enacted, #1 was a very large amount of money, but today $2 seems to disappear whenever one passes a cash register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also seeks to remove so-called sexist terminology. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) would be aware that this is one of my hobbyhorses, that I get concerned about the political correctness that has now been set loose in our society. I think that, sadly, a lot of the terms which have been used in legislation like the legislation we are discussing, and indeed throughout society, may have been deemed to be sexist. But, when one looks at the Latin origins of the particular terminology, really the language and the terms are in fact not sexist at all. I refer to the word `chairman'. Before the committee of the whole was scrapped, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, you were the Chairman of Committees and you had a guiding hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Latin derivation of the word `chairman' does not relate to the fact that you are obviously a male person. But the thought police have been set loose and many whom some would describe as feminazis have said that the term `chairman' is relating to the male. However, when one looks at the Latin derivation of the term there is nothing sexist about it at all. Now we find that the term `chairperson' has been adopted regularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is probably a battle that has been long lost. I am not terribly offended by some of these changes that have been made but I do think it is going over the top on many occasions. Really what we ought to do is to rejoice in our English language, which is a language we have had for a very long time. I think that it is sad that we are tending to distort and change this language simply to attend to the sensibilities of an interest group. There is no doubt that some terms could be changed and should be changed, but I think that far too many have been and that in doing so what we are doing is looking at the perceptions of the language rather than the origins of the particular terms which have been found to be offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police ministers of South Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales and the Northern Territory see no significant differences between the treatment of complaints against the Australian Federal Police if this bill is passed and their own state complaints procedures. The Australian Federal Police Association, which was involved with the interdepartmental working group, now agrees with the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia has raised some points in relation to the amendments. It agrees that evidence taken before an ombudsman should be admissible but that there should also be a corresponding obligation on the prosecution of disclosure of such material in any event. Further to the above comment, there should be a converse rule that the complaint and any statement made by the complainant be privileged from production in proceedings relating to separate criminal charges against the complainant, except clause 6, which relates to false complaints. Otherwise there would be a severe disincentive for making complaints against police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to clause 6, which creates the new offence of making a false complaint or giving false information, the suggestion is made that there should be a requirement that before a conviction can be sustained the charge should be corroborated. The Law Council suggests that this would be no different from a charge of perjury, which requires corroboration and for which the policy consideration justifying the requirement of independent confirmation is the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern was expressed about the ability of the Australian Federal Police to launch prosecutions under clause 6. Even though they are apparently required to consult the ombudsman with respect to such prosecutions, there is no obligation to take the advice given. The Law Council believed that before a prosecution could be launched it should positively require the consent of the ombudsman and it should be independently prosecuted by the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this bill was referred to a Senate standing committee and a report was handed down. Indeed, there was a dissenting report from the coalition in which we recommended that clause 6 be reviewed so that, should the ombudsman object to any prosecution for false complaint or for providing false information in relation to a complaint, the matter would then be referred to the Attorney-General. As I have said earlier, the government has picked up the substance of this dissenting report, with the result that in the Senate an amendment was moved and passed which incorporated what we said in our dissenting report on the bill now before the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short amount of time remaining to me I would like to express some concern over the manner in which the review of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 has been undertaken since its inception. This piece of legislation became law in 1981, which, if my calculations are correct, was 13 years ago. The current amendments being implemented stem from a request from the Australian Federal Police Association made in April 1989. That is more than five years ago. A working party review was not commenced until 1991, which was two years after the request was made. This appears to me to be an extraordinary delay. I really do not know why such a delay has been allowed to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than five years after the original request was made by the Australian Federal Police Association, we finally have legislation which we are debating. I suppose one could say it is better late than never. I really would be interested to know from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General why there has been such an incredible delay. If we are going to take five years from the time a request is made that legislation should be looked at until we find amending legislation brought into the parliament, then quite often that amending legislation could be rendered totally irrelevant by the effluxion of time before we in fact debate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is obviously what has happened in this particular case, because the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has now approved another wholesale review of the act. We can only infer that the initial review took so long to implement that its results were out of date before they could even be implemented. We are now debating a bill which the government knows, almost by its own admission, is outdated. The Minister for Justice is conducting a further review, which presumably will review the review which has indeed resulted in the bill now before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most reasonable Australians would accept that five years between a request for a review and the proposal of legislation is unacceptable, as is the fact that no sooner do we see this legislation than the minister says that we are going to have yet another review. The Australian Federal Police deserves better, and I hope that the government takes this on board. I would be very interested indeed to hear the explanation from the parliamentary secretary, in due course, as to why the government has taken five years from the request until we see this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to offer some comments which are very similar to those offered by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), who has asked a couple of pertinent questions. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act was passed in 1981, creating a complaints regime in broad conformity with the recommendations of two Australian Law Reform Commission reports on complaints against police. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill is the first substantial proposed revision of the complaints regime governing the AFP. It arises out of the review mentioned by the member for Fisher of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 by an interdepartmental working group set up by the then Minister for Justice, former Senator the Hon. Michael Tate, in response to representations made by the Australian Federal Police Association as long ago as April 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The working group had the benefit at that time of contributions by the Attorney-General's Department, the AFP, the ombudsman's office, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the AFP Association. The working group considered proposals by all interested parties, as well as reports of both the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's review of the ombudsman's office, and presented its report in October 1991&mdash;more than three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on 30 June this year, the government introduced legislation to deal with the recommendations of the working group and the concerns of the AFP Association. As the member for Fisher pointed out, this legislation comes some five years after the original request was made by the AFP Association. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) told the Senate committee that examined this bill that he has now approved another wholesale review of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act. One has to query whether another such review should be necessary when this bill has not even been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a fresh review is necessary because the government has dragged its feet in implementing the results of the working group's review, then the situation is of some concern. Justice delayed is justice denied and, for similar reasons, it might be suggested that law reform delayed is law reform denied, or is no law reform at all. The situation of AFP officers, other employees of the AFP and members of the public who are affected by this legislation is cause for concern in these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the general thrust of the bill and, in the Senate, has been able to ensure that proper amendments have been made. The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in August 1994 and the committee reported in the following month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to complaint handling procedures, the bill is aimed at addressing two important issues. The first concerns the general trend towards external review. This involves the introduction of substantive non-police involvement in the complaints regime. The reason for this is the need for an effective monitoring system and, at the same time, a strengthening of public confidence in the complaints-handling process. The external role is filled by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The bill strengthens the ombudsman's role by giving her the power to investigate matters of her own motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is keeping a balance between ensuring that police have appropriate power to investigate criminal conduct on the one hand, and preserving the liberties, rights and privacy of individual citizens on the other hand. To this end, the bill creates the new offence of making a false complaint about the actions of an AFP appointee. The provisions creating this new offence were the focus of some attention and concern in the Senate and before the Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, the main objectives of the bill are fivefold. Firstly, there is provision for the extension of the act to include non-sworn AFP staff. Secondly, three new offences are created, namely, knowingly making a false complaint, knowingly giving false information about a complaint and victimising a complainant or a person who has given information in relation to a complaint. Thirdly, the bill proposes to enable the ombudsman to investigate actions of an AFP appointee on his or her&mdash;in this case, on her&mdash;own motion. Fourthly, the bill will make evidence obtained by the ombudsman in the course of an investigation admissible in disciplinary proceedings. Finally, the bill will allow complaint based disciplinary charges to be dealt with internally by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police where the AFP appointee who is charged pleads guilty. The option of the disciplinary tribunal's hearing the matter is retained where the public interest justifies it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Council of Australia initially raised the concerns of the coalition that prompted referral of this bill to the Senate committee. The concerns included the question of whether before a conviction for making a false complaint can be sustained the evidence should be corroborated, as is required with a charge of perjury. Another concern was whether the consent of the ombudsman should be a precondition to a prosecution for making a false complaint rather than the lesser requirement that the ombudsman be consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the false complaint offence provisions, the bill provides that it is an offence if a person makes a complaint and knows that the complaint is false in a material particular and if a person supplies information to an AFP appointee in relation to a complaint that the person knows to be false in a material particular. The maximum fine is $2,000. These provisions criminalise the making of knowingly false complaints generally but have a particular relevance to non-AFP members who are not already covered by the principal act in relation to false complaints. The policy reason for this offence is the belief that deliberately false and serious allegations of misconduct are directed at AFP members as a common tactic by persons under investigation in order to throw the police off their investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the proceedings before the Senate committee, the Minister for Justice agreed to move an amendment to the false complaint provisions in order to change the requirement of consultation with the ombudsman to a requirement that the ombudsman consent to any prosecution. If the ombudsman did not agree with the decision to charge an individual, then the ultimate decision would be made by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report by the committee recommended that the bill, with the amendment proposed by the Minister for Justice, be passed. In referring to it as a majority report, I would point out that it was supported by the four government members of the eight person committee. The Democrat member, Senator Spindler, and the opposition members delivered two dissenting reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler wanted to move his own amendment to the consultation or consent requirement. He felt that non-police corroboration was necessary for the prosecution of a false complaint and he wanted a general privilege for information made by a complainant in the complaint to the ombudsman to preclude that information being used in subsequent criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition report accepted that, on the issue of corroboration, a charge of false complaint was relevantly different from a charge of perjury and that corroboration should not, therefore, be a requirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I will respond very briefly. There were a number of useful points made by opposition spokespersons and I take those on board. As has been pointed out, the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Amendment Bill has been, in fact, finetuned in the Senate and I am happy to welcome the changes that were made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only comment I want to make of any substance is to respond to the criticism that has been made, firstly, of the time that it took from the moment that the AFP Association raised issues of concern and sought action from the government and, secondly, the fact that the government has now announced a further and, this time, wide ranging review. I would simply make the point that, from the time that the AFP Association sought changes to this legislation, its request, in fact, was not for a wide ranging review of the legislation but for specific amendments that it proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, having considered those amendments, initially set up the working party that has been referred to by honourable members. The working party, in the fullness of time, reported, and the government subsequently went through the processes of having legislation prepared for cabinet approval, the drafting of the legislation and finally the introduction the legislation to the House. All of these things are inevitably matters for priorities and, as such, the government gave this the highest priority that it could in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the new review arising out of the work that has been done on the proposals for amendments that came from the Australian Federal Police Association, the government recognised the fact that this legislation did require a wholesale review and that is what has been now set in train. The legislation in total will be put under scrutiny and, in addition to that, any proposals for changes in the fundamental way that complaints against the AFP are dealt with will be looked at in that review.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law or law enforcement matters. As a number of the amendments are technical in nature, I propose to discuss only the substantive amendments made by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.include certain offences created by the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Act 1992 within the category of politically motivated violence under the ASIO Act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.allow the Director-General of Security to give a standing authorisation to senior officers of ASIO to approve persons who are to be able to exercise the authority of warrants issued by the Attorney-General; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">.allow officers of ASIO to apply for vacant positions in the Australian Public Service even though the positions have not been advertised as being open to the public. </PARA>
<PARA>The offences from the Ships and Fixed Platforms Act which will be included in the definition of `politically motivated violence' in the ASIO Act are similar to those which are already specified in that act. They are of a type often associated with terrorist activities. Accordingly, it is appropriate to include these offences as acts of politically motivated violence against which it is ASIO's function to protect Australia and Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part III of the ASIO Act permits ASIO, under the authority of a warrant issued by the Attorney-General, to collect intelligence by means of listening devices, searching of premises and the interception of mail. To protect individual privacy as far as possible, consistent with the need for ASIO to perform its statutory functions, only officers nominated in writing by the Director-General of Security may exercise the authority of a warrant. At present, these written authorisations must be made for each warrant. The proposed amendment of section 24 of the ASIO Act will allow the Director-General to appoint particular senior officers of ASIO to perform the function of authorising those who may exercise the authority of a part III warrant. The amendment will enhance administrative efficiency without in any way diminishing ASIO's existing accountability in the exercise of its powers under warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the final amendment of the ASIO Act, ASIO officers are not employed under the provisions of the Public Service Act 1922 but under terms and conditions determined by the Director-General of Security. This means that they cannot apply for vacant jobs in the Australian Public Service unless those jobs are advertised as being open to the general public. In view of the restructuring which ASIO has been undergoing, it is appropriate to enable officers of ASIO to apply for positions in the Australian Public Service. The object of this proposed amendment to the ASIO Act is to put officers of ASIO in the same position as officers of the Public Service when applying for vacancies. Officers will compete on their merits and, if found suitable, may be appointed as if they were already a public servant. All appointments will be treated as promotions to allow for appeals by other candidates if applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several amendments being made to the Crimes Act 1914. Clauses 10 and 11 of the bill implement recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission from its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the Law</EMPHASIS> in relation to the sentencing of federal offenders. The amendments will ensure that an offender's cultural background must be taken into account by a court when it is relevant to the sentence or order that the court will make, including when deciding whether to dismiss the charge, or discharge the offender on conditions without recording a conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments in clauses 12 and 13 of the bill also relate to court orders made under the Crimes Act. They will ensure that where courts impose conditions which include monetary amounts in recognisances&mdash;or bonds&mdash;made under paragraph 20(1)(b), the offender cannot be imprisoned for breach of a such a condition, and that where a federal offender commits an offence whilst on a recognisance, breach action may be taken, even if the order has expired at the time the person is convicted of the new offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 13 will also extend the range of options available to a court, where a person has breached a recognisance which has either a suspended sentence of imprisonment or a partially suspended sentence of imprisonment attached to it. The proposed amendments will enable the court to impose a monetary penalty not exceeding $1000, extend the period of good behaviour, or revoke the order and impose an alternative to imprisonment, such as a community service order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes amendments to the `escape' provisions of the Crimes Act which create offences relating to the escape of federal offenders. The most significant aspect of these amendments is the removal of Australian Capital Territory prisoners from the ambit of the provisions. The Commonwealth is no longer responsible for ACT criminal law and the ACT has now enacted its own escape provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the amendment to section 85ZKB of the Crimes Act will remove scanning devices from the scope of the offence created by that section. Section 85ZKB prohibits the manufacture, advertising, display, offering for sale, sale or possession of equipment which is capable of being used to intercept a communication contrary to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. Scanners are radio receivers which can automatically scan all broadcast radio communications and tune into whatever may interest the operator. They are capable of receiving telecommunications which are in part transmitted by radio signals: for example, cellular mobile telephones as certain prominent members of society have found to their chagrin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That scanners currently fall within the scope of section 85ZKB of the Crimes Act is an unintended result of the development of telecommunications technology which in part makes use of radio signals. I am advised that there are some three million scanners in use in Australia although it is, of course, impossible to confirm that number. The government does not believe that it is reasonable to prohibit the manufacture, sale or possession of a device which is readily available and has a number of legitimate uses apart from the possible interception of telecommunications. However, it hardly needs to be stressed that unauthorised use of a scanner to intercept telecommunications partially transmitted by radio signals remains an offence under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 as does subsequent unauthorised publication of any material collected in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983 are being made so the ACT can be admitted into the national uniform interstate transfer of prisoners scheme as a participating state. At present ACT prisoners are covered by the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983. Following ACT self-government, the Standing Committee of Attorney-Generals, SCAG, considered the issue of the interstate transfer of ACT prisoners for welfare and trial purposes. The Cairns meeting of SCAG, held on 11 and 12 July 1991, decided that the ACT would be admitted to the national uniform interstate transfer of prisoners scheme, and it was agreed that the legislation of each jurisdiction would be amended to recognise the ACT as a participating state for the purposes of the scheme. The amendments implement that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the schedule to the bill makes amendments to a number of acts. Again, I only propose to deal with the more significant of these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments will be made to the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, the Crimes (Hostages) Act 1989, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, and the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990 to transfer responsibility for issuing certificates relating to the entering into force and operation of certain multilateral treaties from the Attorney-General to the ministers who are responsible for the treaties. The amendments will also remove requirements for gazettal of these certificates where this requirement exists. Gazettal was originally required to enable copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> to be tendered in court proceedings. However, this is not necessary in practice, since a new certificate may be issued each time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amendment to the Customs Act 1901 will ensure that, where a claim for recovery of items forfeited under the act is made but not pursued, the goods are automatically condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth when the claim is discontinued or dismissed for want of prosecution. Currently, separate proceedings must be instituted for condemnation resulting in extra costs to the claimant as well as to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two amendments are made to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. The first will give the director the function of appearing in proceedings or inquiries held under the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991. Australia is bound by international conventions to hold such inquiries or proceedings in relation to hijacking and similar offences on aircraft involved in international civil aviation. The amendment will ensure that experience in these matters is concentrated in one body. Inquiries and proceedings under the Crimes (Aviation) Act are also to be included among the matters in which the director can give undertakings of immunity to witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment concerns court orders prohibiting or restricting the publication of evidence or information in certain cases to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice. Courts already have this power in relation to civil remedy and recovery of pecuniary penalty actions instituted by the director. The amendment will expand these categories to include proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 seeking restraining orders over property, or the extension of the period of operation of such orders. Before such an order can be granted, the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the defendant committed a serious offence: a serious narcotics offence, an organised fraud offence or a money laundering offence. Satisfying the court of these matters often involves affidavit evidence which reveals details of witnesses or of an investigation. In some cases the court may need to make an order prohibiting or restricting the publication of this evidence to protect a witness or to ensure the effectiveness of a continuing investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the Extradition Act 1988 made by this bill will ensure that Australia can fulfil its international obligations under the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the related Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. Australia's accession to the convention and protocol took effect on 20 May 1993. The convention and protocol are designed to prevent and suppress maritime terrorism and they list offences in relation to acts likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of a fixed platform. Those offences are extraditable within the terms of the convention and protocol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As extradition will not be granted for political offences under the Extradition Act, it is necessary to put beyond doubt that the convention and protocol offences are outside the definition of `political offence' in that act. The amendment therefore excludes those offences from the definition of `political offence' for the purposes of the Extradition Act. The `political offence' definition has been limited in this way for a number of other multilateral conventions to which Australia is a party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes an amendment to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 to enable Australian Federal Police officers performing customs functions on Christmas Island to receive reports on the transfer of currency into or out of Australia under section 15 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 made by this bill will ensure that the act can be applied by regulation to one country for one or more of the following three purposes:</PARA>
<PARA>.to give effect to a bilateral treaty which provides for mutual assistance in relation to limited subject matter only;</PARA>
<PARA>.to give effect to a non-treaty bilateral arrangement providing for mutual assistance in relation to other subject matters; and</PARA>
<PARA>.to give effect to our mutual assistance in criminal matters obligations to a country which, with Australia, is party to a multilateral treaty or convention which contains mutual assistance obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by again pointing out to the committee that this second reading speech demonstrates the urgent need for provisions which enable ministers or other persons to table second reading speeches without reading them. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is another piece of legislation which indicates that the parliament works. Unfortunately, our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) tends to refer to the Senate as unrepresentative swill. However, having looked at this bill, its genesis and the procedures that it has followed to achieve the form that we are now debating, one can only conclude that the Senate is a vital house of review. The Senate is, indeed, a very important part of this parliament in making sure that the legislation which ultimately becomes law is legislation which is suitable, legislation which is well considered and legislation which does not have bugs which have to be ironed out subsequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also notice that the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is now what is termed an `omnibus bill'. This means that a large number of pieces of legislation are amended as a result of this one bill. Indeed, I understand that the government is seeking to make amendments, in some cases major and in other cases minor, to 17 acts of the Commonwealth parliament under this omnibus bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not opposing this particular piece of legislation but, once again, I would like to register my concern at the way in which the parliament seems to be bringing in more and more omnibus bills that seek to amend a very large number of pieces of legislation which bear little or no relation to one another. These omnibus bills mean that, if I want to see what acts the Commonwealth has passed in amending legislation, or if I want to keep up to date with legislation, I will need to acquire a large number of different acts. I also suspect that consolidation of acts has not occurred as much as it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a person was particularly interested in one area of the law he or she might have to buy the principal act, along with various amending acts. With these large numbers of omnibus bills passing through the parliament, it will be very difficult to track down just what the law is in any individual area. I think the government would do well to look at this procedure to see whether it could be improved to make sure that when omnibus legislation relates to acts which have some common thread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not adequate for the parliamentary secretary or the minister to come in here and say, `We are going to bring forward this legislation to amend 17 acts. These acts have nothing in common with one another but these are the 17 acts this week that my department feels ought to be changed and amended.' We could more easily understand what the law is, and what the changes are, if we had amendments to particular pieces of legislation being dealt with with legislation similar to the legislation being changed, rather than an omnibus grab bag such as we have before the chamber this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the coalition got to see this omnibus bill, we decided, as we always do, to consult widely in the Australian community. We have been in touch with the various state and territory Attorneys-General, the state and territory police commissioners, and the shadow minister assisting the leader on multicultural affairs. Of course, we have also contacted the Australian Federal Police Association, the Public Service Union and ASIO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is to amend certain acts relating to criminal or law enforcement matters and for related purposes. I have just mentioned that the 17 acts that are being changed do not bear any particular relationship to one another but, for reasons of convenience, they are being amended under the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. Significant aspects of the bill include amendments to the ASIO Act 1979, and this is amended by section 24 being repealed and replaced to allow the Director-General of Security to give a standing authorisation to an officer of ASIO to approve persons who are able to exercise the authority of warrants issued by the Attorney-General. Consultation with the Director-General of ASIO has indicated that this amendment is considered to be quite acceptable and it is not controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act 1914 is being amended to require a court to take cultural background into account when sentencing federal offenders and to include cultural background as a consideration when discharging offenders without proceeding to conviction&mdash;section 19B(1)(b)(i). The amendment adds cultural background to those of character, antecedents, age, means, and the physical or mental condition of the person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments were recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the Law</EMPHASIS>. While it is the case that many factors relating to the circumstances of an offence are taken into account at sentencing, and there are circumstances where cultural background is relevant to the commission of an offence, we want the government to make it clear that this amendment is not intended to allow offenders to claim that their sentence should be reduced simply because of their cultural background. The Australian Law Reform Commission referred to this possibility but it was confident that the courts in their discretion would use the legislation appropriately. This is one of the matters that have been referred to the Senate committee as a result of the debate in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes Act 1914 is being amended further, at section 20(2A), to read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person is not to be imprisoned for a failure, under an order made under subsection (1), to pay an amount by way of reparation, restitution or compensation or an amount in respect of costs.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment appears to say that someone who has the benefit of not having a sentence passed, by virtue of an order being made to that effect, but who has breached the order, cannot be sent to gaol for the breach. Currently, however, such a breach can result in the person being dealt with in any way allowed by the act for commission of the original offence. This means, in effect, that the court can exercise its leniency in favour of a defendant who, if he rejects by breaching the relevant order the opportunity that the leniency offers, cannot be sent to gaol for breaching the order but can be dealt with almost as though the special non-custodial order had never been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us&mdash;I have no reason to disbelieve it on this occasion&mdash;that there is no increase in outlays by the Commonwealth as a result of this legislation. During a debate in the other place, Senator Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, put forward the coalition's point of view. As a result of the cooperative atmosphere in the Senate, this bill was sent off to the Senate standing committee and it was also looked at by the Senate scrutiny of bills committee. I am pleased that the government has accepted the amendments suggested by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In doing so, the government clearly took into account the evidence that was placed before that committee in relation to the question of cultural background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I outlined a moment ago the concerns that we had in relation to the inclusion of cultural background but, when the act includes the approach that other matters should be taken into account by courts when sentencing people, probably cultural background should indeed be included. The other point of view would be that we appoint people to our courts who are of very balanced approach, who are able to make an assessment of sentencing options and who when sentencing are able to take into account all the circumstances surrounding a particular offence. I suppose the other way to approach it would be to remove all of these matters which courts are required to consider and leave it up to the judge's commonsense or the magistrate's commonsense, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament has chosen to go the other way, by including matters that courts must take into account when sentencing offenders. If that is the way we wish to do it, as we have done it, the opposition certainly is not opposed to the inclusion of cultural background as a relevant matter to be taken into account by the court when sentencing federal offenders. It is highly likely that, even prior to this amendment, courts in Australia have taken into account cultural background. Those courts would include courts exercising federal jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that it is important to realise that, by the form of legislation proposed in the bill, cultural background will be relevant not to guilt or innocence but simply in determining an appropriate sentence. That is something that really ought to be stressed. Certainly, it is appropriate that this is an aspect which is taken into account at the time a sentence is imposed. It would be unfair, however, to say that, because someone is of Aboriginal background and because Aboriginal tribal law permits a person to be killed in certain circumstances, in the Australia of 1994 such an Aboriginal would be entitled to kill in accordance with Aboriginal law even though, under Australian law and law the world wide, such an act could not be permitted. In this context one could consider other matters also. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has talked about the question of female genital mutilation. There is a great abhorrence in Australia of the practice of female genital mutilation and members on both sides of the chamber have expressed their concern in relation to this particular offence against women. If the law of Australia is changed, I certainly will be pleased that, just because a person comes from an ethnic background where this practice has indeed been the norm, that would not be a sufficient reason to allow that person off the hook. This really must be stressed because some people in the community would be suggesting that the inclusion of the words `cultural background' might mean that some people in Australia, because of their cultural background, are permitted to do things that other people are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that we are one people in Australia. We are one nation and the laws binding all of us should be the same. However, given the diversity of the ethnic make-up of some parts of Australia now, it is obviously appropriate that cultural background should be included as one of those matters which courts should take into account when sentencing a person after a person has been found to have breached the law. The committee also reached some conclusions in relation to breach of bond, namely that parliament should be vigilant in ensuring that the laws its passes will not enable offenders to receive some forbearance in sentencing to later abuse this indulgence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the committee of the Senate was satisfied that the amendments proposed in the bill would not lead to any such abuse. The amendments were widely supported in evidence before the committee, were seen as being crucial by the ultimate Commonwealth protection authority and remedied some obvious but minor deficiencies in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter I would like to refer to is a result of examination of the bill by the Senate scrutiny of bills committee. A few minutes ago I highlighted what an important role the Senate plays by way of review. It is very important that the Senate tries to make sure that the legislation does not have bugs in it. This legislation was examined by the Senate scrutiny of bills committee and it resulted in amendments being suggested by the government, which we accept also. Those amendments relate to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act of 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A change has been made to clause 6 dealing with the delegation of power to authorise warrants. The category of officer was changed from officer to senior officer. It is really important that, if powers are given to the Director-General of ASIO to delegate powers to someone, those powers should not be delegated to the most junior person working in the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament obviously is very hesitant about allowing delegation of the very senior and serious responsibilities given to people such as the Director-General of ASIO, but we accept that, to enable the organisation to operate efficiently, at times it is necessary for the Director-General to say that it is not possible for him to do something but that someone else should attend to it. So it makes sense that there should be a provision in legislation permitting the Director-General to make these delegations, but it is vital that the delegations are made to people who are of a senior rank, people who are able to use those delegations responsibly. I am very pleased that the government has accepted that suggestion. The coalition very strongly supports that provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also a provision in the amendments in relation to the ASIO Act that, instead of having to make an authorisation on each occasion it is required, standing authorisations to senior officers of ASIO can be made. I think that is imminently sensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the coalition has consulted widely throughout the Australian community on this particular piece of legislation. There were a couple of bugs which were, in fact, highlighted&mdash;the use of word `bugs' is a freudian slip and an unfortunate term to use when one is referring to ASIO. These hiccups were looked at and considered. They were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and to the Senate scrutiny of bills committee, with the result that some changes were suggested. The government has clearly accepted those changes and, as a result, the bill before this Committee has been improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports this bill. The opposition was concerned and is pleased that the procedures I have outlined have been followed. I hope these procedures are followed in many more bills. Ministers often come to this Committee, the chamber or the Senate and have to rectify bad legislation which should not have been passed in the first place. The procedures that have been followed in this bill indicate that we are moving some way along the road to iron out those problems before they actually get on the statute books. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill with no central theme. It amends a number of acts administered within the justice portfolio. There are two aspects of the bill on which I would like to focus today: firstly, the amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 in relation to the cultural background of an offender; secondly, the amendments to four acts relating to the entering into force and operation of certain international conventions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crimes Act 1914 lists matters which a court must take into account when passing a sentence or making an order in respect of a person convicted of a federal offence. The matters already listed include: the nature and circumstances of the offence; the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence; the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person; and the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person's family or dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will add the words `cultural background' to this list. The effect of this will be to make the cultural background of a convicted federal offender a matter which a court must take into account when passing sentence or making an order. One could interpolate and say that, if the Crimes Act did not specify any matters, it would not be necessary to introduce the cultural background of the offender. But, given that there is something of a checklist for the judges and magistrates to refer to, an exclusion of an item such as the cultural background could suggest an intention that it not be taken into account. This amendment is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second place in which the cultural background of an offender will be relevant. Where a charge for a federal offence is proved, the court is empowered under the Crimes Act to dismiss the charge or to discharge the offender if the court is of the opinion, having regard to matters listed in the relevant part of the act, that it is not expedient to inflict any punishment or to inflict any punishment other than a nominal penalty or that it is expedient to release the offender on probation. The matters listed in the act in this regard include: the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person; the extent, if any, to which the offence is of a trivial nature; and the extent, if any, to which the offence was committed under extenuating circumstances. The bill will add to this list the concept of cultural background. Accordingly, the effect of this amendment will be to make a federal offender's cultural background a factor which a court may take into account in determining whether to proceed to a conviction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been pointed out by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), the bill is not proposing to make an accused's cultural background a defence to a federal criminal offence. The amendment is designed to implement recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Multiculturalism and the Law</EMPHASIS>. In that report, the ALRC unequivocally rejected introducing a defence of cultural background to absolve, partially or completely, an accused from criminal liability. Equality before the law is such a fundamental basis of our system of justice that it would be quite inappropriate for such a defence to be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, however, a relevant consideration to be weighed by the court at the stage in which an accused has already been found guilty. At the same time, offenders should be under no misapprehension that their sentence should be reduced simply because of their cultural background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was introduced in the Senate on 30 June 1994, and the provisions relating to cultural background are aspects of the bill that were referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on 25 August. The committee presented its report in September. In its report, the committee noted that taking cultural background into account in sentencing was endorsed by, among others, the Law Council of Australia, the New South Wales Bar Association, the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia, the National Children's and Youth Law Centre, and Mr Martin Sides QC, of the New South Wales bar. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions did not oppose the recommendation that cultural background be taken into account in this way. The evidence before the committee was overwhelmingly in support of including cultural background as a relevant matter in the sentencing of federal offenders. This aspect of the bill is supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of the bill is various sections of various acts which are being repealed and new sections substituted. The acts in question are the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, the Crimes (Hostages) Act 1989, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976 and the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and the Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990. The acts themselves are not terribly pertinent to my comments. The effect of the provisions to be repealed is that they allow the Attorney-General, by notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, to declare that a specified international convention entered into force for a specified country, including Australia, on a specified day, or that a specified country denounced a specified international convention and the denunciation took effect on a specified day. Secondly, they provide that a certificate signed by the Attorney-General certifying matters concerning notices given to the International Civil Aviation Organisation is prima facie evidence that matters certified in the notices was given to the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal effect of the provisions to be substituted will be simply to transfer the power to issue notices and certificates from the Attorney-General to the minister responsible for administering the relevant convention or conventions, and will remove the requirement for notices to be gazetted. The matter is not of great moment. The only comment that I will make on the substance of the proposed amendments is that one hopes that appropriate procedures would be enforced in the relevant departments to ensure that the appropriate requirements of international law are met. If this means seeking the advice of the Attorney-General's Department at an appropriate time in an appropriate way, that should be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some brief, general comments to make on the subject of treaties and conventions. This is a contentious subject and it is not only under debate within the government, as I will indicate, but also is the subject of considerable debate within the coalition parties. It reflects concern within both the business community and the community generally, and it particularly reflects the concern of those with an interest in the protection of the position of states under the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power to make a treaty is an executive act which is derived from the prerogative of the Crown. Under our written constitution, the constitutional power to make treaties is derived from section 61, which provides for the executive power of the Commonwealth to be exercised by the Governor-General. Neither in relation to constitutional convention nor in our federal constitution is there provision for parliament to become involved in the treaty making process, except where legislation is necessary to implement a treaty. However, a number of procedures have been put in place over the years, at least since 1919, which have involved parliament. Currently there is effectively no procedure through which parliament has a role in relation to the making of a treaty. Some practices have been introduced and allowed to fall into disuse, and other practices have been proposed. The most recent comment from the government is a joint statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) which was issued on 21 October 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of treaties is widely recognised, and the necessity for some treaties to be negotiated within the confines of government and not revealed publicly except at appropriate times is recognised as a necessity also. That sort of treaty would be a bilateral defence treaty or something of a similarly sensitive nature. Other treaties have involved the community in a big way. It is a coincidence that yesterday, 16 November, was the day upon which the Convention on the Law of the Sea, a most important treaty, actually came into operation by reason of being ratified by 60 subscribing states, of which Australia is one. The manner in which the government treats the treaty making process obviously varies with the nature of the process under which it is negotiated and the subject matter, but the simple fact is that the government treats the parliament with scant regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the joint statement the two ministers assert that the provision of information through the tabling of treaties and the publication of information relating to multilateral treaties under negotiation in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS> will be supplemented. It is said that wherever possible the government will supplement the information flow by now tabling all treaties other than sensitive bilateral ones before action is taken to adhere to them. `Before action is taken to adhere to them' is a little ambiguous, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A treaty goes normally through at least two stages from the point of view of a signatory state. One is the process of negotiation and agreement, which is concluded by the signing on behalf of the state, and the second significant point is that it is then ratified by the signing state in a subsequent step. As in the case of the law of the sea convention, it does not automatically mean the treaty itself will come into operation, because there may be provisions in it that prevent it from coming into operation until the occurrence of some minimum condition such as a minimum number of signatories ratifying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A treaty imposes an obligation on a ratifying state, at international law, to implement the obligations undertaken, as required, within municipal law; that is, within the domestic laws of the state. From the sentence that I referred to from the joint statement of the ministers, it is not clear that it is compatible with the government's supplementing the information flow by tabling treaties, other than sensitive ones, before signature, before ratification or before implementation of the treaty in domestic law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two ministers, I am advised by representatives of the media, conducted a media conference following the release of the statement. The explanation offered at this point seems to be that the information flow will be supplemented by tabling all treaties before action is taken to implement them in international law. If that is a supplementation of information flow which is meant to be of benefit to the community, it is absurd. It does nothing. I think the silence of the media in relation to this particular statement reflected the attitude the media took to what was being offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint statement suggests that steps will also be taken to increase the possibility of participation by members of parliament in various treaty negotiating delegations. That has occurred in the past; it is something that is to be commended. But the manner in which members of parliament are to be selected and briefed, and the role which they are to play, is not dealt with at all. Obviously, it would be a difficult matter, which would require different considerations in different situations. But it is a hollow offer, containing no detail at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the minister has offered to provide full briefings on treaties under consideration or negotiation to any member or senator who asks for them. I hope that opportunity is taken up. But, having regard to briefings I have received from the government when I have requested them, I do not have any confidence that the briefing will be significant or detailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is totally missing is any genuine proposal for consultation with the community. In January this year, the Business Council and seven other organisations issued a joint press release criticising the government for entering into treaties affecting business, and imposing cost on business, without consulting business as to the effect of those treaties. The Business Council and, on this occasion, 11  organisations issued a further press release in April this year, complaining of the same thing in more detail and in more vehement terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments are very critical of the manner in which the Commonwealth government enters into treaties, sometimes apparently with the purpose of ensuring that the Commonwealth's legislative power under the constitution is extended by the use of the existence of the treaty to enable legislation to be passed based solely on the external affairs power. We have had two bills debated in the House of Representatives in the last month which were based on the external affairs power. The significance of that to the states is not to be underestimated, because, ultimately, it means that if treaties are entered into legislative power can be extended across virtually any subject matter whatever. The role of the states, recognised and defined under the constitution, could be eliminated. It is inappropriate and wrong, and should not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state governments also have a complaint, which seems to be fully justified, that the process established for the consultation by states in relation to the negotiation and entering into of treaties does not provide an effective means of consultation with state governments. In fact, the matter was of concern as long ago as 1987, when the Constitutional Commission was conducting its investigations and the possibility of the establishment of a treaties council was ventilated in its final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important subject. The government is treating it with scant respect and I think the community, reflecting the views of states and industry, will ensure that something has to happen to improve the current treaty making process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to delay the Main Committee for long because many of the points on this matter have already been raised by my learned colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and we are very appreciative of the often important legal advice he is able to give us in the coalition ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is to amend certain acts relating to criminal law enforcement matters and for related purposes. The bill amends 17 acts. As I think has been mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the bill was examined by the Senate scrutiny of bills committee and it was also referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was referred for examination those provisions of clause 9 which related to cultural background and to a breach of order, something that I think many in the community would have some interest in in relation to differentiation because of a person's cultural background. The evidence before the committee was overwhelmingly in support of including cultural background as a relevant matter in the sentencing of federal offenders, and it is a matter that many courts consider now already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the form proposed in the bill, cultural background will be relevant not to guilt or innocence but simply in determining an appropriate sentence. The committee's conclusion as to breach of bond was that parliament should be vigilant in ensuring that the laws that it passes will not enable offenders who receive some forbearance in sentencing to later abuse this indulgence. The committee was satisfied that the amendments proposed in the bill would not lead to such abuse. The amendments were widely supported, were seen as crucial by the ultimate Commonwealth prosecution authority, and remedy some obvious but minor deficiencies in the existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The examination by the Senate scrutiny of bills committee resulted in government amendments to the bill regarding the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979. Change was made to clause 6 dealing with the delegation of power to authorise warrants and the category of officer was changed from officer to senior officer. As was noted by the opposition in the Senate, in particular by Senator Ellison from Western Australia, the government must be terribly careful that, where it is dealing with the delegation of power to authorise such warrants, the delegation is to a person of sufficient seniority, and not just anyone. Therefore the coalition supports the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to say that Senator Ellison's points are rightly made because these days the drafting and issue of warrants is a serious matter, far more than was the case some years ago. We have seen that in recent times in the case of the inquiry into the bombing in Adelaide in relation to the NCA where a warrant was challenged and there was a problem with the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that that delegation of power to authorise such warrants be to a person of sufficient seniority. As Senator Ellison somewhat facetiously put it, you would not delegate to the office boy the ability to authorise a warrant. Therefore, as we said, the coalition supports the amendments and noted that in the Senate debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill involves some amendments that have workaday effects. The cultural background provision is quite an important one because it reinforces something that has already been undertaken in sentencing arrangements by courts. I would like to commend, in particular, the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone, and the other senators for their work in relation to the reference of the bill in the first instance to the scrutiny of bills committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is an omnibus bill. The title of `law and justice legislation amendment bill' is often attached to these sorts of omnibus bills. This bill amends 17 acts, mostly in minor technical consequential ways. The points that were raised in the Senate bear repeating. One of the great dilemmas facing us in this modern era of legislation on just about every activity under the sun is that there are often technical or drafting errors or unclear elements in legislation that have to be tidied up; otherwise the legislation is unworkable or its intention is so unclear that it makes it very difficult for an interpretation to be made, particularly in the case of someone who is interpreting it for the benefit of a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debates in the chamber yesterday in relation to the Racial Hatred Bill, we heard some very important comments from the honourable member for Tangney and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) in relation to the question of explanatory memoranda, in particular, that there is an over-reliance by the government on explanatory memoranda to get it off the hook in relation to badly drafted legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred yesterday to a particular instance and I will mention it again today. In the case of the training guarantee levy, the enabling legislation provided that, in the calculation of wages and costs, holiday and long service leave was not included as part of the overall calculation, but the explanatory memoranda included it. The difficulty was that, when anyone used or was governed by that legislation, it was extraordinarily difficult to arrive at the right answer when there were two conflicting points of view in the legislation and the explanatory memoranda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the explanatory memorandum has no authority in that case but, if someone were trying to interpret the legislation using the explanatory memorandum as a basis, it would be extraordinarily difficult, particularly if it was legislation which was not terribly clear in the first place. That has occurred on a number of occasions and it is one of the reasons we are here today debating what is basically an omnibus bill to clear up some legislation and to introduce reforms in other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney-General in the Senate talked about being bright enough one day to use some sort of technological advance which will allow amendments to separate bills to be put in electronic form and to be distributed easily so people do not have to buy the old fashioned paper with 17 amendments and 17 bills. The sooner that day comes, the happier I will be. I can recall that, as a police officer, I used to spend the best part of my waking hours, when I was not out in the street, cutting out the amendments and pasting them in the acts. In those days, some of my colleagues were a bit slack at this; it was inspected and signed by the sergeant. I can well understand the shadow Attorney-General's worry about the increasing complexity of modern day legislation. As a consequence of the scrutiny of bills committee, an amendment allows the Director-General of Security to give approved officers of ASIO a standing authorisation to issue warrants on behalf of the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow Attorney-General pointed out that they had consultations with the Director-General. In the end, it was  quite a sensible amendment to the bill, as it would clearly be acknowledged that there would be occasions when the Director-General would not be available to approve persons who are to exercise authority of warrants. If he is not available, it causes difficulty, and there is obviously no valid reason not to fix that. We would not want the thing to grind to a halt, purely and simply because the one delegated officer with the authority was unable to be present to exercise that authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the difficulty was that, all of sudden, we had the situation where the authority could be given to any ASIO officer. For years, there had been the view that the authority could be exercised only by the Director-General and the intention was that he would give it to a person at a level. But, as a result of a drafting oversight in the initial legislation, that authority could have been given to any officer of ASIO. I agree with the shadow Attorney-General in her conclusion that the government did not intend this consequence. It was as a result of the spotting of that particular problem by the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that the matter was addressed and tidied up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It reinforces the importance of that scrutiny of legislation that is undertaken by the Senate and reinforces the very important role that the Senate plays within our constitutional system of representative government. Often, in the House of Representatives, the people's chamber, as we like to refer to it, there are occasions when the government pushes bills through in such an extraordinary rush that technical problems contained therein are only discovered when some poor unfortunate citizen is hit by some consequence of that particular legislation. The Senate is doing a great service for the rest of the community, because it is clear that, on many occasions, the government is quite unable to draft legislation that is clear enough, or sufficiently targeted in the first instance, to avoid some expensive legal process later on, in which people try to interpret the debates or whatever might have been contained in the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious that the bill has been given a fair amount of debate in the Main Committee already. But there is one point I would like to raise in the concluding moments. It is a point that has fascinated me and, in a way, it fits in with some of the aspects of the bill. Some time ago&mdash;I do not have the questions to hand&mdash;one of our independent colleagues in the House of Representatives, the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), raised some questions about the taxation liabilities of a certain fellow called Guiseppe Verducci who, as some of us here would know, was involved in the Winchester inquest and was the owner of a property associated with the Bungendore Six affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to support what the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has said on this Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, and pay tribute to the job that the member for Moore has done, ever since he has been a member of this parliament, in raising issues of moment. I vividly remember, for example, the first occasion on which the member for Moore spoke in the adjournment debate in the House of Representatives. He initiated the debate on the subject of the Burke government in Western Australia and WA Inc. I was in the chair on that occasion, and I remember the speech very well. Ever since then, the member has properly raised issues of substance. We do not very often get people in this parliament with his expertise on the subject of law and crime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, having said that in relation to the bill, I feel constrained to respond to the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) on the subject of whether what the member for Moore said could properly be said in this chamber. The member for Moore and I are both members of the Standing Committee on Procedure, which brought in the report that set up this chamber. We actually put in a dissenting report on this subject, and so we are both very familiar with what this chamber may or may not do. The member for Shortland is in error, and he needs to recheck the report and everything that has flowed from it in terms of debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was never a suggestion that there could not be disputation or contention in this chamber. There is, however, a requirement that no issues can be carried to vote here when there is disagreement between the government and the opposition. If there was any suggestion that, by virtue of a subject being referred here, opposition members could not properly raise contentious dimensions to those issues, then that would be a very big blot indeed on the copybook of the Keating government. I will not go into the subject of how this might be lamented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is quite proper, whilst not moving an amendment or moving against the second reading, for a member to raise topics which are germane to the legislation and which are controversial. If not here, where? These bills are referred here after the first reading. There is no second reading debate prior to their coming here. They come here by arrangement. There is no way of knowing whether any government or opposition member, in the course of his or her speech, is going to raise issues of contention on some legislation. There is, however, a general agreement between government and opposition at the time of referring that the bill itself is not going to be one that is likely to be subject to amendment. But even then the opposition does not commit itself to not move any amendments to any such bill&mdash;nor does the government agree not to move any amendments to a bill&mdash;by virtue of the bill being debated in the Main Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of there being amendments, the bill would have to go back to the House of Representatives for consideration. I think it has actually already arisen that bills which have been debated in the Main Committee have subsequently had amendments to them moved and debated in the House of Representatives chamber. Therefore the referral of a bill here is not meant in any way to constrain members on which matters they may raise that are germane to the bill. Since the member for Shortland chose to speak at some length on that subject whilst addressing his remarks to this bill, I felt that perhaps I could do so, too. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to effect the repeal of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Act 1976, that authorised the ratification by Australia of the agreement to establish a financial support fund among OECD members. The fund was designed to assist OECD members facing serious external account difficulties following the oil price crisis of 1973-74 and was intended to supplement, on a last resource basis, other sources of credit to which members encountering serious difficulties have had recourse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When proposed to parliament, the government saw the main value of the fund in terms of its capacity to help maintain healthy trading and financial relationships between the major countries, encouraging and assisting members to avoid unilateral trading restrictions. The bill was debated by parliament on 6 May 1976 and the corresponding act received royal assent on 25 August 1976. However, the corresponding legislation was not proclaimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fund was never brought into effect, because of the failure of some other OECD countries (most notably the United States and France) to ratify the agreement. In the meantime, the world economy has already been exposed&mdash;and adjusted&mdash;to two major oil price shocks, the first one, which gave origin to this legislation, when the average crude price for petroleum more than trebled, from $US3.14 per barrel in 1973 to $US11.22 per barrel in 1974, and the second one, in the late seventies, when it rose from $US12.95 per barrel in 1978 to $US35.48 per barrel in 1980. With petroleum prices now fluctuating in the range of $US16-17 per barrel, equivalent to around $US5 per barrel in 1973 prices, we are now a long way back from the sense of emergency of the early 1970s. </PARA>

This bill is to repeal the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Act 1976. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has indicated to the chamber, this arose from variations in oil prices back in the early 1970s. In fact, the act which is the subject of this bill, and therefore the act which will be repealed, arose from an agreement signed by OECD member countries, including Australia, in Paris on 9 April 1975.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origin of this is in the period which immediately followed the intervention by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries into the world oil markets in 1973. Of course, this had serious consequences then for the non-OPEC countries: it transferred real income from these countries to oil producers. In the process, inflation was aggravated, the recession deepened and the balance of payments position of non-OPEC countries deteriorated. There was quite clearly a need at that particular time to look at legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the parliamentary secretary made the comment in his second reading speech that part of the reason why this fund never came into existence was the failure of some other OECD countries&mdash;mostly notably the United States and France&mdash;to ratify the agreement. Amongst other countries, it was the administration of the United States which suggested&mdash;it was also suggested, independently, by the Secretary-General of the OECD&mdash;that the establishment of a financial safety net be brought into effect in the early 1970s. Despite that initial suggestion being made, the United States was one of those countries that did not ratify the agreement, and the need for that has passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a second reading speech delivered on 6 May 1976, the then Australian Treasurer, Mr Lynch, said that the government saw the main value of the fund in terms of its capacity to help maintain healthy trading and financial relationships between the major countries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Quarantine Amendment Bill 1994 provides the power to AQIS to refund money so that it can rebate a total of some $13 million to several industries that it has overcharged in recent times. There are many other industries that would also claim that they have been overcharged, but they are not getting a refund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, at the insistence of various industries, recently established the Industry Charging Review Committee. This committee has determined that AQIS has overcharged various industries by a total of some $13 million and has now determined that this money must be rebated or refunded in various ways. The affected industry groups and the potential amounts involved are: the processed foods export sector, $1.319 million; plant exports, $4.732 million; live animal exports, $0.940 million; post-entry plant quarantine, $0.476 million; seaport quarantine, $0.774 million; airport quarantine, $1.132 million; and import clearance, $3.724 million. It is proposed that of the total sum of some $13 million, $1.6 million will be rebated through this legislation and $6.9 million through regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industries involved have been consulted about how they would like their money rebated or returned. Some have agreed to some of the money being used for specific projects such as quality assurance facilitation and residue testing programs, but the bulk will be used to provide fee rebates or fee relief during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While strict accounting has highlighted the fact that various industries have been overcharged, and they will now receive refunds, the largest area of inspection costs is in the meat industry overall but, in particular, the red meat industry. In this area, there will be no refunds. The costs remain far too high, but there will be no refunds because of the consistent problems of securing effective reform in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, the government set aside some $15 million for AQIS redundancies as part of its restructuring packages, but the money was not used. Why was the money not used? It was not used because of union resistance to reform and to the redundancies, a resistance which, as I will point out to honourable members in a moment, is putting at risk not only the efficacy and performance of our export meat industry, but also the jobs of those involved in it. It is a classic example of mates being anything but mates to one another in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meat industry is hopeful that the coming Senate inquiry, for which we secured bipartisan support, will help ensure that costs are reduced. The minister indicated earlier this year not only that he would agree to the inquiry but also that he accepted the terms of reference which I felt were broadly necessary. That inquiry will, hopefully, highlight the question of how far the reform process has gone, but I suspect, worryingly, that it still has a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very important issue. Australia is a trading nation critically dependent upon trading performance for its prosperity and jobs for its people. For years the government has been intent on letting the world know that it needed to get its economic and trading house in order. It has been active in GATT, and we have supported that process. It is now active in terms of the APEC negotiations, and we support that. But the problem is that in certain areas at home we have had a very stubborn resistance indeed to the need to tackle some hard issues and some hard reforms. Now that we find ourselves looking at a more open market and looking at a situation where we are going to have to be more competitive than ever, not only because of GATT but also because of APEC, we have some big problems, because in many areas we are behind the eight ball&mdash;and we are dragging the chain very badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a problem in the area of our ability to obtain an adequate slice of ASEAN markets, but it is worse than that. There is clear evidence emerging that some areas of traditional Australian strength, in terms of our productivity and our capacity to do a good job at the right price, are seriously compromised here at home. This has been highlighted in quite a fascinating way by the recent proposal by the restaurant chain Sizzlers to import up to 190 tonnes of United States beef. It backed off that because there was a community outcry. Some of the community outcry, I have to say, was a bit misguided. It was along the lines of `You must keep this out because it is American beef, because it is American beef, because it is American beef. We ought to be able to use our own, and if we cannot compete then that does not matter.' It is competition that is the real problem here. We have to remember that we send some 300,000 tonnes of beef to America, so we can hardly complain if somebody wants to bring 190 tonnes of beef into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is worrying about this and what should send a chill down the spine of every Australian is that, if we look at it closely and we get behind the rhetoric about it being because of the drought&mdash;Sizzlers suddenly discovers now that it can source beef in Victoria, where the drought is not so bad anyway&mdash;we discover some very disturbing things. We start to get close to the truth about why Australia's economy will not fully recover unless real reforms are made, why we are staring down the gun barrel of a blow-out in our deficit, and why we will not be able to successfully trade unless we stop putting off the hard issues. I want to put it to the Committee simply that we are in danger of not only not being cost competitive on ASEAN markets, which we are consistently told we must now ensure that we perform on, but we are not being properly competitive domestically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want the committee to consider these very worrying facts. American cattle prices are currently, in our dollar terms, 60 per cent higher than those received by Australian farmers. The price is around $3.70 a kilo dressed weight in the US compared to $2.30 here, so the raw product would cost a potential importer like Sizzlers considerably more. Sizzlers would have to pay American farmers a lot more than it would have to pay Australian farmers for the raw material. So what happens then, presuming these people want to import this stuff? They put it through an American abattoir, or packer, as they put it, they slaughter the animal, they bone it, they pack it into boxes, they transport it in container form to the waterfront, they load it onto a ship, they sail it across the pond, they unload it on our notoriously expensive and inefficient wharves and they distribute it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Astonishingly, after all of that, the rump steaks here, according to industry sources, remain at least price competitive and, according to a quite a substantial number of meat processors I have spoken to in the last few days, almost certainly cheaper than the Australian product. It is quite unbelievable. We have had report after report in this country saying reform is necessary. The government deserves, in my view, thumping condemnation for the appalling reality that, despite its endless rhetoric about our improving competitiveness, we are still just not making the grade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One instance of this relates to the meat inspection costs. They are much higher in this country than they are in the US, as the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) knows only too well because he has got one of Australia's biggest abattoirs in his electorate. Not only are the costs much higher in this country but also the work practices&mdash;particularly the restrictive work practices engaged in by so many of the people involved&mdash;have for a long time effectively blocked improvements in reform and efficiency in other aspects of the meat processing industry, particularly on a case by case, site by site basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had report after report. The latest was from the Industry Commission. I do not know why the government keeps running Industry Commission reports because it never listens to the advice it is given. The latest report has just agreed with the seven, eight or nine that have gone before: the Australian beef industry is competitive on Asian and other export markets only because Australian producers are forced to accept significantly lower prices than they should have to accept, because our process and transport sectors and our government sectors&mdash;taxes and charges and whatever&mdash;are bogged down by outdated work practices and by excessive government involvement, red tape, costs and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very significant point that needs to be made is that we are in the midst of the worst drought we have seen for decades in this country. One of the reasons that the problem is so severe is that producers have been forced to accept much lower prices than they should have accepted for their produce. Depending on which report one listens to, the inefficiencies in processing, transport and inspection services are so severe that they have cost producers between $30 and $100 a head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know about other cattle producers in this room but it would have made a hell of a difference to me&mdash;and I confess to having a vested interest in this&mdash;and to the people that I represent if we had had that money in real terms for the last 10, 15 or 20 years. We might have been in a position to wear this drought far better. One of the things that needs to be clearly understood is that this is just yet another example of why the government is, in large part, culpable for the extraordinary circumstances pertaining to rural Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's contribution to drought is about $162 million over two years. It pales into insignificance when one considers what things like interest rates have cost the rural sector. Beef exports are now worth about $4 1/2 million a year. Imagine how much better off our major rural producers would be if they had had that extra $30 to $100&mdash;depending on who one listens to&mdash;in their pockets because the rest of the industry had been efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole thing is now brought home to us in the bluntest imaginable fashion by the American industry. It is unbelievable that, in a country where we can produce the beef for less than the Americans, they can still land the stuff here for less than we can provide it in this country because the post-farm gate levels of performance in this country are so utterly abysmal that they push the price through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cannot compete effectively enough here on our domestic markets, what chance are we going to have of maximising our potential in Asia? Who will be the losers? Not only the farmers I have just mentioned but also the workers: the people who work in these plants, the people who are employed by the beef and the sheep meats industry. What is going to happen if we cannot maximise our performance in those sectors and we are not cost competitive when the drought breaks and when there is massive overcapacity&mdash;because that is what there will be? The dislocation will be enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for this nonsense that our unions go on with, we know they are protecting a few hundred jobs in AQIS, and that is standing in the way of major reform. They are putting at risk the prosperity and the jobs of many thousands of other Australians. It is about time a few people in this country started to wake up to the fact that if they behave in a troglodyte fashion they will often end up hurting the very people that they claim to be representing. It is time that these reports that I referred to earlier, which culminated in the IC report and which have been consistently ignored, are not ignored any more but are acted upon. It is time they were acted upon quickly and decisively, so that we can turn this thing around. There is no point in doing as some Australians have done in recent days and resorting to an old-fashioned, protectionist, `keep it out at all costs', tub-thumping sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of Sizzlers' threatened importation of American beef must be seen for what it is: a clarion call to action. The beef industry itself, industry leaders and participants in it, are all for free trade. After all, Australia is somehow or other still the world's biggest beef exporter, but this case proves that we are severely limiting our own potential. We must get serious about giving our industry a competitive economic environment or we will continue to be steamrolled by countries that do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to the specifics of AQIS's major customer, the beef industry, and the impact AQIS's performance has had on it. Beef is now Australia's largest rural industry, as I mentioned a moment ago. Over 70 per cent of product is exported. The industry&mdash;unsubsidised, efficient, export oriented and intent upon improving its performance&mdash;has managed to establish a very strong place in the liberalising Japanese market, and is opening up new outlets throughout Asia. It is a real performer; although, as I said earlier, it maintains that performance by forcing farmers to take a lower on-farm price than they should have to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major beef companies in this country at the moment is trying to have this industrial relations mess sorted out. I will tell you one of the major reasons why company representatives say it has got to be sorted out. They say that if we are not careful&mdash;if we keep screwing down growers' returns in this country&mdash;growers will not be able to provide the improvement in genetic performance that is vital to capturing and securing markets in the future in Asia. The Americans, the New Zealanders, the Argentineans and the Europeans will outstrip us in that vital area. There must be adequate returns to farmers. That is in the interests of the entire beef industry and, of course, of our export industries, if they are to remain fully world competitive. We have a situation where to date our farmers have been able to do it, but the other links in the chain need a bomb under them. Instead, of course, they have been blighted by inertia for years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can put some figures around the questions we were talking about a moment ago: how do the Americans get there, and why are they more competitive than we are? In major research about 18 months ago the MRC found that we were engaged in a fight to the death for market share in Asia, and now we find we are threatened even here at home. The Americans can process beef for as little as 16.5c a kilo. This is not some Third World country we are talking about, this is the wealthiest nation on earth, and their costs are 16.5c a kilo. The Argentineans and the New Zealanders are getting their costs down to the mid-20s&mdash;25 and 26c a kilo. In Australia, as of about 18 months ago, the cost in our best practice plants was in the high 40s&mdash;about 49c. That is double New Zealand and Argentinean levels, and three times American costs. Why? I think we have answered that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time we got on with effective reform. I cannot emphasise this too strongly. The major meat company I was talking about a moment ago, which is engaged in reform, is now trying to get through to its workers. Maybe it has been too slow, but at last it is trying to communicate with its employees. What is getting in the way? The unions in the middle. But the message that the company is trying to get over to the workers in its plants&mdash;and that I am now delighted to learn is starting to get through&mdash;is that the only way they are going to get a better return, the only way they are going to actually enjoy higher wages, is to improve productivity and do a better job. The company is making it plain that if they will do a better job it can reward these people more attractively. I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I have the greatest admiration for people who work in abattoirs in this country. I go through abattoirs very frequently. It is not pleasant work, and it is hard work. You see a lot of people who work very hard indeed in difficult and unpleasant circumstances. All power to them! I am all for better returns for them, but it is going to mean changing the way we do things. We still use the old, outdated tally system. Nobody else uses that, but the unions in this country stubbornly hang on to it. We have had inadequate capital investment for years. Why? Because we cannot get the flexibility we need to use the new capital equipment properly. That is why we are so far behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that in the interests of all involved it is time we stopped putting this off. For years we have had agreement that it needs to be changed from all players, except the unions in the middle&mdash;the AMIEU in particular and the Public Service Union representing AQIS. In case we need any further sobering up, I remind the chamber that in 1960 Australia was the fifth largest global exporter of processed foodstuffs&mdash;this is the area where our great future in Asia is supposed to lie&mdash;and today we are the 11th. We have not been improving; we have been slipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a chronic and now rapidly escalating problem with its trade imbalance as we supposedly pull out of the recession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), one would think our meat industry was in a state of absolute collapse, that Australia was a totally inefficient producer, that it was unable to export and had a myriad of problems that we could not solve. However, we happen to be the world's biggest exporter, as the honourable member himself said. We happen to export hundreds of thousands of tonnes of beef to the United States. The member for Gwydir said something about 190 tonnes coming into Australia, and he made the conclusion, therefore, that we are in dire straits. Of course, that does not add up. We export hundreds of thousands of tonnes to Japan and to other markets in Asia. We are an extremely efficient and extremely large exporter of beef on the world scene&mdash;that cannot be denied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say we cannot do it better or that there are not problems with AQIS. The costs are too high, and the government is committed to solving that problem. When the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he made a commitment to restructure AQIS, and that commitment is carried on by the present Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Collins). We will get there, but we will not get there by kicking unions or by kicking meat workers. The member for Gwydir himself said that they do a good job. They do hard work in bad circumstances, and their interests have to be considered in the whole equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot say that everything that is wrong with an industry is due to the unions. Of course it is not, because there is a whole range of issues. We are efficient producers and we can be better. One of the areas in which we can improve our performance is the meat inspection area&mdash;there is no doubt about that&mdash;and the government is committed, and has been for some time, to restructuring AQIS. There are difficulties involved in doing that, but we are committed to getting a better result and to lowering the costs of meat inspection in abattoirs in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal amendment proposed by the Quarantine Amendment Bill 1994 is to provide the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with the power to refund the whole or part of a fee payable by a person for a quarantine service provided by AQIS. In the past he has not been able to refund overcharged money, and that has been a flaw, I believe, in the legislation which is addressed by this legislation. The amendment will primarily affect our primary industries and, with much of rural Australia in the grip of a very severe drought, it is an important amendment that will provide some rural producers some relief from fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reading speech to the bill indicates that the reason for the proposed amendment is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to allow revenue collections which are surplus to cost recovery requirements in a financial year to be returned to the relevant industry groups in the form of uniform fee rebates in the following financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>The estimates by the government are that the surplus collections amounted to about $6 million in 1993-94. The National Party and the Senate estimate that the figure could be as much as $13 million, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy said the refund could amount to $15 million. But, whatever the figure, it is unlikely that there should be too much opposition from the industry in handing it back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's press release of 31 July foreshadowed that AQIS would soon be providing details of surplus revenue for 1993-94. Once those accounts were finalised AQIS would be discussing with the industry the manner in which the refunding of those surplus moneys would take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has matched those words of 31 July with the legislation before us today. AQIS has said that its recovery areas in 1993-94 were in the areas of processed food exports, dairy, fish and dried food exports, livestock exports, grain exports and quarantine import clearance&mdash;that is, airports and seaports. It is difficult to understand why such legislation has not been with us in the past, and it is very difficult for AQIS or any other organisation to adequately estimate how much it would require from industry in order to conduct its activities. The logical thing is to overestimate what it requires so that it is not left short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the collection system introduced for research and development in the beef industry, we get a fair indication of how difficult it is to calculate those collections. The cattle transaction levy, for instance, was introduced after some parts of the industry voiced strong opposition to the slaughter levy in existence at that time. AQIS set a fee of $6 payable each time a beast changed hands. The collections were way in excess of calculations, and the AMLC industry policy council has recommended to government, on several occasions since, that those fees be reduced. The government has acted each time on those recommendations and the fee is now down by about three-quarters to a quarter of what it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to calculate the level of collections because it is almost impossible to predict the level of usage in certain operations. Predictions of costs and takings are difficult, and it is not unreasonable to expect that excess collections should be returned to the industry. In fact, it would be unreasonable to expect that they would not be. The explanatory memorandum in the bill explained that refunds would be structured for each industry group, in accordance with the agreements entered into with AQIS, through AQIS charging review committees. AQIS has established nine committees, one for each major sector of industry that AQIS services. They cover exports of meat, processed food, organic food and grain, horticultural exports and imports, live animal imports and exports, imported foods, quarantine import clearance and quarantine airports and seaports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of this House would agree that AQIS performs reasonably well in respect of its food inspections and supervisory functions. The two areas that needed most attention were the development and supply of sound business practice in relation to planning and organising structure, and the encouragement and application of professional, technical and administration management and leadership skills at AQIS. Calls for changes in those areas have come from the concerns expressed by industry about the on-costs of AQIS services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, this government is responding to the concern of the rural industries. The member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), was trying to say that we were not responding, but of course we are responding. If we look at the meat processing industry we find one of the biggest reforms. The government is introducing competition on meat inspection services and, if AQIS wants to retain a share of the work in the future, it will need to be efficient. It is widely recognised that Australian farmers are some of the most efficient in the world. That is reflected by the extent of our meat exports, but those efficiencies are hindered by government charges and regulations. Changes that we have introduced to AQIS services, such as fees and refunded collections, now mean that we can retain the integrity of our food standards&mdash;which is extremely important&mdash;and we will also be able to deliver those services more efficiently to the industry and to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture show that the north coast region of New South Wales has an estimated 850,000 head of cattle. It is the region's single biggest income earner worth $140 million annually. It provides 13 per cent of the total production of beef in New South Wales. We have export abattoirs at Wingham, Macksville, Grafton and Casino&mdash;Grafton and Casino are in my electorate&mdash;and there are scores of smaller domestic works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised along the east coast as an important nurturing ground where cattle are produced for fattening along other areas of coast. The beef industry on the north coast is spread over the entire region and is based largely on running breeding herds. Three-quarters of those herds produce weaners, with the remainder selling vealers and growing out and/or finishing steers. Store wether weaner producing herds are mostly run on native, lower quality pasture areas. Calves are in store condition at six to 12 months of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate is also home to the largest meat processing plant in the Southern Hemisphere, the Northern Cooperative Meat Company at Casino. The Casino meatworks is capable of processing more than one million kilograms of dressed carcass each week and any reforms of AQIS operations are obviously of great importance. The meatworks have been very supportive of the government measures and its moves to introduce them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a loss of international confidence in the quality of our food, that would rip the heart out of many of our primary industries. When making efficiency savings to AQIS, governments have to be careful that it is only the cost and not the rigour of testing which is reduced. The slash and burn calls that we hear from the opposition&mdash;and heard a little while ago from the member for Gwydir&mdash;have the capacity to threaten our international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 18 months the government has progressively made efficiency gains through AQIS operations. It is the increased efficiency of the organisation that has led to this bill coming before the House. Costs have been reduced. We now have some unspent money to return to the industry. Further efficiency measures in AQIS remain a priority and a necessity for the government. When these measures are in place, we will be able to return more money to the industry. This bill allows us to do that, and it should receive the support of every member of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I get a bit tired of the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) coming into this place and thumping the furniture in his attempt to make points. His apparent understanding of the beef industry compares to his lack of understanding of the wool industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation follows a promise from the government to reduce costs. It returns AQIS money beyond its costs to the sectors of the industry from where the excesses came. That is certainly to be welcomed. When people talk about efficiencies they really have to analyse what they are saying. The member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) comes in here and, on this occasion, runs a very free trade line; on other occasions he is different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really need in AQIS today is an ethos which does everything it can to expedite exports, but to take a much more conservative view on imports. There are obviously trade reasons for that, reasons which our competitors understand all too well, but there is another reason. Australia's relatively disease-free status does require us to err on the side of extreme caution in terms of entry of any product that could even remotely carry disease into this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in the big push for world trade, and in the widening of trade, that we are going to see an outbreak of the spread of diseases around the world, as occurred in history. The black plague spread through Europe on the heels of expanded trade and killed one-third of the people of Europe in the carnage it caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sort of thing can happen and it will happen again. We have to be always vigilant about quarantine on imports to this country. I do not believe that we can err too far on the side of caution in this matter. If there is any risk at all, we should be saying no. I believe we should be saying no in this case and damn any GATT consequences. The member for Gwydir was running a very strange line. In his speech, he condemned the industry, and condemned the unions, and then spoke of his admiration for the workers, who are, of course, overwhelmingly members of the union. He also said that we are non-competitive and then mentioned how well we are doing with our exports. It was the usual plethora of statements that the member comes in and makes in a lot of his speeches. They are, of course, all made with the greatest authority and the greatest confidence. I think it typifies the oft held view that the emotional content is far greater than the facts in his contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company which was looking to import beef from America, Sizzlers, stated that it was looking to import beef not as a matter of price but as a matter of securing supply because of the drought in eastern Australia. The company also said that its customers had complained bitterly about this, so it looked around and found other sources of supply within Australia, which it did not know were available. It is quite clear that it was not something that was done on price. I know people in Western Australia who claim that, if they could access the export quotas, they could sell a lot more beef in Europe, but that they are being inhibited from doing so. That is a problem, but it is clearly not a problem that has anything to do with AQIS, rather it is a problem within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lamenting at the low price Australian farmers receive for beef does have some merit. The price we receive is too low compared to the price in the importing countries. I believe the main reason for this is the vertical integration and foreign ownership of the industry. That is the main reason that prices are low. It is something that has been allowed to happen and it is something that we should take every opportunity to redress. We should find different marketing techniques into these countries. It is clear that we will be able to expand our markets into Japan. We are doing so in the face of the competition with the United States and we are doing it relatively successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say that improvements cannot be made. As the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) said in his contribution, they can be made and we should be looking at everything possible to improve performance where we can. It is all very well for the member for Gwydir to come in here and lambast this government in respect of AQIS. But AQIS is not a new problem; AQIS is a longstanding problem. This government has done more to address the problem than was ever done by the previous government and of course that cannot, in all honesty, be denied. I think we are getting there but we can only get there if we have cooperation within the industry. It is simply counterproductive to take out the big sticks, as the Deputy Leader of the National Party wants to do, and bash and blame unions for the problems. If we want to get the answer, we have to address the real problems and not the ideological or imagined problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned about the shape of the rural sector in Australia. I see new industries started and thwarted for a variety of reasons. The issue of an emu industry has been drawn to my attention recently. This is an industry which has enormous potential and it is an area in which Australia should have a monopoly because the emu, of course, is native to Australia. The industry was started in Western Australia, but we now have the situation where there are more emus in captivity in the eastern states than there are in Western Australia, and many more emus in captivity in the United States than there are in Australia. We are in danger of losing an industry which should be an indigenous industry. It is an industry in which we have a monopoly and an industry with a product of enormous world demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this in other areas. We see other people developing our flowers, probably better than we are, and I think we must ask ourselves why this is so. Of course, it is not all gloom. I believe the wool industry, through dint of its own resources and support from a sector of the government, is a good example, and I think the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) needs a lot of credit for the support he gave to the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority in the downstream processing of wool. It is going to be one of the great success stories, and in my view within the next decade it will again make wool Australia's biggest single export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the Quarantine Amendment Bill, I think it is a very straightforward bill. It is, I am sure, a bill that must be endorsed by everyone. It is a bill that aims to reduce costs, and it addresses the accountability which the minister said he would put into AQIS. I believe that if the pressure is kept up in this area we will see those reforms. But at the end of the day this must be clear: the future for Australia is not as a low wage country. The future for Australia is only, and can only be, as a high wage country, and that means that with our high wages we are going to have to get productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do that in some areas: for instance, in the mining industry. Australian miners are without doubt the most productive in the world. Comparisons with South Africa show that we are much more productive than the South Africans are, particularly in the area of hard rock mining. This has been brought about with the development of a culture of excellence in the industry and a recognition from the workers of the very important part they play in the industry. I have a friend in Perth who is a mining engineer&mdash;a world-class mining engineer. In terms of deep shaft sinking he is probably the leading Australian expert. He tells me that having worked around the world he would rather work with Australians than anyone else. He says he can work with two fewer men on a platform in a shaft, and he says that Australian miners are much safer and smarter in their work than anyone else. He does not say they work harder&mdash;in fact, he gives that to the Irish&mdash;but he says that our miners are the best he has ever worked with. I believe that that ethos can be spread to other industries. There is no reason why we cannot develop that culture everywhere, because in my experience what workers overwhelmingly want is a fair go. They are not looking for rip-offs of profits. The ethos of a fair days's pay for a fair day's work is imbued in the Australian worker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is not much more than can be said on this bill. It is certainly an initiative that fulfils the minister's promise. It is an initiative that I believe the industry should welcome, and I certainly hope it will lead to continuing improvements in efficiency and productivity, because there is no future for Australia as a low wage nation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to allow the overpayments of fees that AQIS charged for quarantine services to be refunded in the form of fee rebates to the relevant industry groups. AQIS is a public body which has to be able to justify its pricing policies to its clients. It also must make its costs and recoveries visible to them. The word `transparent' is used a lot today. I think that is fair enough, for all government bodies should be transparent. They should show industries why they are charging certain fees. They should be able to justify their cost ratios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant increases in industry activity and reductions in operating costs arise from reform processes, and there has been a lot of reform taking place through AQIS and in this area for some time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides the mechanism for refunding that surplus to the industry groups. At the moment there are no remission powers in existence, hence the need for this bill. The industry groups that are affected and which would gain from the rebate are: the processed foods exports, $1.319 million; plant exports, $4.732 million; live animal exports, $0.940 million; post-entry plant quarantine, $0.476 million; seaport quarantine $0.774 million; airport quarantine, $1.132 million; and import clearance, $3.724 million. There will be some real benefits to these industries from this bill. The mechanisms and processes of the system have become much more efficient, and industry is now gaining from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quarantine has been essential to Australia in the past.

That is a big task and it takes a lot of coordination, a lot of specialist people and a lot of effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS applies sound scientific principles to quarantine decision making. Through our geographic isolation and a strong quarantine policy, Australia has been kept free of many of the pests and diseases that have occurred in many other countries. Things are changing. The world is certainly much smaller in terms of travel and the breakdown of trade barriers, so there is more pressure now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In economic terms, Australia's position has meant that our agricultural exports have had an advantage over those of many other countries. Tasmania is in a special position as it is an island attached to an island continent. It can be especially thankful for the far-sighted quarantine services that have been available throughout Australia over the years. Of course, the image of clean green that applies right around Australia is certainly being applied in Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our service has to keep up with all these changes and it has to do so by making sure that it is accountable to the industries that it serves. In 1988 there was a review of AQIS which has resulted in many changes and advances. The service has become very streamlined as a result of that review. AQIS is now delivering an improved level of service, with more transparent assessment of import applications and increased risk control over incoming passengers and cargo, as well as such things as ballast water and ship and aircraft waste. We have had some experience in Tasmania with ballast water coming from several tankers or woodchip ships on parts of the coast. This water has given us, we believe, a starfish which is now eating just about everything that exists on the bottom of some of our bays and harbours. We have quite a substantial shellfish industry in Tasmania and the starfish climb over each other until they eat everything that is on the bottom, then they start eating themselves. They continue till they find some further nutrients for them to expand on. It is complex and those are not simple issues to get on top of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The job these days is being made more difficult by the increasing use of technologies. The fundamentals, however, remain the same&mdash;a service based on risk assessment and risk management principles. I have heard some argument about what the risks are, what risks we should base assessment on and what percentage of risks, et cetera. These fundamental principles are continuing to be assessed, reviewed and improved to ensure that Australia keeps its place in the forefront of the green clean trade which is now becoming our trademark. We must apply the same stringent rules even though there is a freeing up of the markets around the world. Free trade does not mean lowering standards and Australia has the most to lose if we become slack in our quarantine service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the meat industry is worth well over $3 billion in export dollars, probably $3 1/2 billion. The integrity of the service has to be maintained because of the dependence of the export meat industry on having a very good inspection service. The failure of that industry would be devastating to some regional areas of Australia and the livelihood of many country communities. In the community I live in, it would be devastating if for some reason the plant there were to be targeted as one that did not live up to the high standards that it has in the past. Our inspection service is very important in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, introduced an AQIS client feedback scheme that included a national framework of experienced staff backed up by a purpose-built computer software program. This takes conventional customer relations a step further in providing a monitoring and a response capability that caters for all users of AQIS. The scheme allows AQIS to respond quickly to particular problems or situations being experienced by individual clients or groups within a particular industry. It is a free service and is assisting Australia's push to export more agricultural products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS is required to recover 100 per cent of user attributable costs but, because it has been constantly improving the range and quality of services it offers, there have been some good savings, which have led to the need to redistribute the surplus back to the industry, and that is what this bill, of course, is all about. It would make sense if the industry used these savings to improve quality control and the education of producers on the importance of Australia's disease free status and ways and means of producing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to look at the products coming in from overseas and to make them safe for the Australian market without limiting their access. That is an issue that gets plenty of debate in some quarters as well. With the lowering of trade barriers and everything else, governments will at times be accused of using their inspection services and their quarantine services in restricting trade. We should make sure that ours has a professionalism about it and that we have our arguments sound in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those industries that comes within my ambit in Tasmania is the salmon industry. The Canadian salmon industry is endeavouring to push wild salmon into the Australian market. After spending many millions of dollars in establishing our salmon industry, we would certainly want to make sure that whatever was coming into Australia was disease free. That will be something that we will need to watch with great caution. I support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on the standing committee report called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working with the environment: opportunities for job growth</EMPHASIS>. I found the document an interesting document but some aspects of it seem to me to work in both directions. Some aspects work towards the creation of jobs in the environment but some&mdash;and I am not critical of this&mdash;seem to be working in the other direction. That is probably the way these things are going to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its summary, the report says that the environmental policy should be pursued in an atmosphere of Commonwealth-state cooperation, rather than confrontation, and that there are signs that this cooperation is not always achievable. I think that is true, but I have to say that, from my experience, the blame for it not always being achievable can fall either way. I notice that the report makes a suggestion that it would be a good idea if the Western Australian government were to reconsider its position towards the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council. Members will be aware that we supported very much the establishment of that council but did raise one or two reasons why the Western Australians were unhappy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be wise of the Commonwealth, if it does want that sort of cooperation&mdash;and it should happen that we should get that sort of cooperation&mdash;not to throw around the threats that it has in the last year or two. I give the example which I have used in this place before; when the Commonwealth could not get its way with the Western Australians on Mabo and the Native Title Bill, through its former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), it threatened to withdraw some of the Landcare funding to Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second point I wish to make is that nearly the whole first page is filled with recommendations to form interdepartmental committees and agencies and high level groupings and so on. I hope that opportunities for creating jobs in the environment area do not simply come down to opportunities for creating these sorts of jobs alone. I actually agree with the upper end of the prognosis. The committee says that it found there was a potential for employment growth of at least 20,000 jobs within the Australian pollution control industry. Taking a more expansive view of Australia, if Australia could capture only two per cent of the world market, 150,000 jobs could possibly be generated. I would be optimistic about that but I would not be too optimistic if we managed to get too many of these environmental jobs bogged down in committees. In a minute I will come to what I think has been one of the drawbacks under Landcare where that may have become a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A considerable amount of space is given in the document to options for a carbon tax. These options are discussed in relation to replacing state payroll tax with a carbon tax or, as described in other places, with an environmental levy. Taxes tend to work against the creation of jobs. As this report had as its main thrust the environment and the creation of jobs, I think that a great deal of care should be given. I admit it says that a lot more evaluation needs to take place and I agree totally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some discussion of greenhouse levels. I think there is an opportunity in this committee to raise the possibility, or at least raise the thought, that we are a long way yet from knowing what sorts of effects the greenhouse gases are going to have on our environment. It behoves us to be extremely careful not to go about any expensive or extremely expensive measures in trying to deal with the problem&mdash;a problem which still has a whole lot of questions unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions are rising enormously and have done. There is no doubt that some of the other gases in their CO(2) equivalents are also doing damage as well as CO(2) itself. As yet&mdash;and I just say this in a statistical sense, not in any way in a conclusive sense or in an emotional sense&mdash;it does not seem to me that there is conclusive evidence about what is going to happen about the increase in those greenhouse levels. For example, is it true that any warming that is taking place is taking place at night? Is it true that in fact the daytime hours in the last few years have become cooler? Again, I think that science is still out. The answers to these sorts of problems are still out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is tremendously important that this country goes about the business of reducing greenhouse emissions as rapidly as it possibly can, there is no doubt that the government has committed itself in the Rio agreement to arrangements that it probably will not be able to meet. Mind you, I have to say it is no orphan there. Almost every Western&mdash;not all, but almost all&mdash;OECD government may be in the same boat. I raise it because I think that leads us to another particular subject which one can raise at least in this Main Committee, and that is the matter of sinks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this to get discussion. I think that the rules that surround the anthropogenic&mdash;human-caused&mdash;emissions need some looking at. Are we saying that because of the fertilisation effect, the increased CO(2) and its ability to translate into increased growth in the flora sense, we should not be credited in this country with the flora we have? I think it is something worth raising and I raise it in the spirit of debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not filled our country with people, probably for the very good reason that we do not have the water. We have not done a Singapore. We have not done an East Africa&mdash;although those countries would not be included at the present time&mdash;and we have not done a China. We have not filled this place up with people, yet the measurement system is on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that our area of influence now extends for 200 nautical miles out to sea. That is, of course, a natural sink in the same way as our land mass is a natural sink. Whether we should or should not be credited with the fact that we have looked after our land mass by not filling it up with human beings, whether we should or should not be accredited with some of the fertilisation effects of that, and whether we should or should not be credited with the sea that we now own are things for Australians to think very seriously about. At the moment, with respect to the rules that have been set, it looks as though we may have to do some things that are rather drastic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know there are some provisions under the arrangements for us to take account of geographical differences and there is also a provision that we should not do great harm to the economy of the country. I have not even raised the possibility of taking a more global view by saying that our coal is less polluting than the coal from other countries. I have not raised some of the more obvious difficulties in this business such as what will happen in China and India as they raise their standards of living, and I have not raised the issue of whether the arrangements will harm us economically. I want to make sure that nobody misunderstands our position: we are very keen to drop the greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as is reasonably possible. I think there are some other aspects of this that this parliament needs to debate and think about very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that there is increased funding for Landcare. We need to look very carefully at this funding because until now most of the Landcare funds have not, in my view, helped the land. The funds have helped those people who are progressing the awareness of Landcare and that has been done very well. There are a lot of people out there now who understand the issue. There are also a lot of people out there who would love to do something about the land they own, but they do not have the resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that there were one or two comments in the recommendations that seemed to say that Commonwealth funding under the national Landcare program should only be directed to state government agencies, subject to an unequivocal commitment by the agencies to use the funding to employ additional staff resources and be subject to regular reporting. I agree with that. As I understand it, the suggestion that some of the states have been stealing the money or not putting the money through to Landcare programs has been made, and that should be stopped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a recommendation that we double the Landcare program. If we are talking about the creation of jobs that recommendation will do two things. Firstly, it will mean caring for the land&mdash;with a revegetation program, for instance&mdash;which will mean the money will be used for that. Secondly, in the process of that being done in the most efficient way possible, it will create jobs. I draw the attention of members to that particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to one other matter, not having time to raise more. I noticed that the feral pest program will be increased to at least $10 million a year. Let us just get this down to what has been happening. The Commonwealth itself owns areas full of feral animals&mdash;jammed full of them&mdash;but does nothing about them. If we are going to use this money properly, firstly we have got to get the science right and the technologies right. But secondly we have got to have some plans. I do not like to use the military term but we must have some strategies as to how this thing is going to happen, and not just throw more dollars over the top of it. It will require people. There are very good people around who could do it. Even today, without too much science, some of these animals could be removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone past any of the debate where we start thinking too much about animal liberation. What we have got to think about is the native flora and fauna and how we are going to get rid of these feral animals. I was very pleased to see that the Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales had a two-day seminar on this very aspect alone. Those are a few very brief comments on the subject of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would just like to make a few comments in relation to greenhouse gases. I first raised this matter back in 1984. At that time it was pooh-poohed and people laughed, saying that nothing would happen. I think people are starting to realise now that the greenhouse effect is actually happening&mdash;carbon dioxide and other gases are increasing; the temperature is rising. In about 1985 I made a speech made up of anecdotal bits and pieces that I had ripped out of the newspaper, as I normally do, showing even then massive storms, floods and things like that. I know this is not scientific proof but I feel that these things are increasing around the world and that the greenhouse effect is starting to be evident in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make some comments on various aspects of our report. In the first area we have made a recommendation regarding finance for solar hot water units. In the 1960s I used to work in Darwin, at the time when the federal government built the majority of the housing there. It insisted that solar hot water systems be fitted to all defence houses and things like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, DCA, et cetera. That government decision forced Australia to set up its own solar heating manufacturing industry. That is the sort of area we can get into once again. Even in Melbourne I have a solar heater in my backyard and I use it for heating my hothouse and swimming pool. I am one of the people who actually use one; however, not many people in Melbourne do it. We could have great savings in Melbourne. Other cities should have it. The Commonwealth government should be giving tax incentives. I know we recommend energy cards and all those sorts of things to try to get people to move more into this area. We are world leaders in solar hot water technology; there is a great market there and we can move in there very quickly. I am quite certain that it will create many thousands of jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area that I would like to talk about is solar cells. I spoke on this report for a couple of minutes just recently and I spoke about solar cells. To me, that is the way of the future. We are definitely world leaders in solar cell technology. I can foresee that the roofs of our houses will all be solar cells that will power our house and feed our batteries, and then we will just hook into the grid through our computer when the batteries run low or it is a cloudy day or whatever. I can see that actually happening. That sort of technology and that sort of thin film solar cell that is being produced now are a huge leap forward in something that does not burn fossil fuels, does not have any sort of problem with the environment and actually gives advantage to all who use it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would just like to give an example of one of the problems that is actually apparent right now. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of some time ago there was a story about a young couple who built their house about 150 kilometres from Brisbane. Liz and Rolf Tennant are the people who built this house, and their power needs are supplied wholly by solar cells and solar energy. They have a local electricity line which is a fair distance away from their particular property. When they moved into this property they spent about $7,000 actually installing the solar technology, the solar power system, solar hot water system, et cetera. For them to connect up to the power grid would have cost $10,500, so they saved probably $3,000. They thought, `We have spent our $7,500, therefore we should not have any power bills from now on.' However, it was not to be. The Queensland equivalent of the SEC, the state power board, has decided to charge them $1,750 for the fact that the power line goes in front of their property. They do not even use it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I think this is going back to Joh's time. In fact, I am certain it would have been Joh Bjelke-Petersen installing this. He would have had his own people putting up the power poles. Anyway, that is $1,750 to actually have the power lines going past their property. This is the sort of area we should be looking at a lot more closely. Instead of using those power stations in Queensland&mdash;I will mention the Victorian power stations later on&mdash;emitting all the carbon dioxide and with all the other added problems that go with them, here we have an enterprising couple using environmentally friendly technology and they are still being forced to pay $1,750. That is the sort of area the government should be involved in and we should make certain that the income of that sort of couple should not be affected by this sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually have a water tank at home where I get water off my roof. I let it rain for a while and I have a special little gadget; I pull a handle and fresh water comes in. All the gunk off the roof has been washed off and I have a nice pure water supply. If I stopped the expensive water from the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works, or whatever it is called these days, it will charge me rates for just having the water going past, even though I do not use it. These are the sorts of things we should be looking at because all of that extra work that we do in that area creates work for plumbers, solar cell technicians, electricians and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, during its deliberations, visited Alcoa in Portland, Victoria. There is a real problem in Victoria because Alcoa produces a huge amount of aluminium. It is one of the biggest producers of aluminium, and the majority of it goes overseas in ingots. But we are not actually selling aluminium; we are selling electricity, because all that aluminium that is being produced by Alcoa is subsidised by the Victorian taxpayer. It is subsidised to the tune of $198 million per year. This is the Jeffrey Kennett government. It is forcing Victorians to subsidise this huge multinational to the tune, as I said, of $198 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we say it is $200 million a year and there are 800 people working at Alcoa in Portland, with my skills in maths it is quite easy to work it out this way. We subsidise it for $200 million a year. That is, each one of those people working there is subsidised $250,000 per year. I would not mind getting a job for $250,000. We could close down this aluminium plant in Portland, pay those people $200,000 a year and we would still be making a profit. That will not happen, of course, but what the Victorian government should do is get stuck into Alcoa, not give it this subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Treasurer there has been making some noises about this but the government really should take Alcoa on. All these multinational companies are doing is taking cheap electricity, polluting our atmosphere, and shipping it somewhere else. It is important that we point out these things. The people who work in this plant are being subsidised to the tune of $250,000 per year. It is important to have those people working there. Their product and their wages go back into the community but it is also important to look at the economics of this sort of development which in some areas is being pushed fairly hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another submission to the committee was on the idea of making a pilot tidal plant in the Kimberleys. This was mentioned by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles). I have heard about this idea for many years. I have actually seen a bay there where the tide is a waterfall going in and a waterfall going out. This happens every day. There is a huge potential for power to be generated there just going to waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kimberleys are a long way away. There is not much there that could use electricity. If we put lines down, it would just be wasted. However, there is another process called electrolysis where people could use the electricity to convert sea water into hydrogen gas and pipe this gas to Perth, NSW, Victoria and Queensland. This is the Rex Connor idea coming back but I think it could work. Hydrogen is a gas that, once burnt, is non-pollutant. It is virtually inexhaustible up in the Kimberleys because we are always going to have tides and they will always be generating electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that there should be some sort of pilot study there and I think we should make certain that that comes about. That is another area in the future which could create a lot of jobs, could improve the environment and could make it certain that we have unlimited power in a very cheap form. Hydrogen gas could be used not only for heating, for driving gas generators and turbines for electricity in the major cities, but also for cars and things like that. I can envisage a time when we will pull up in our garage and hook up to the gas line and charge the commuter car up overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another interesting statistic about the green area which I think gets lost. People forget about it. A survey was taken of taxpayers' priorities. It was on what taxpayers want most of all for their dollar. The area where they want the most money spent is the environment. If we have a look at it, they want less money spent on national defence. They want less money spent on unemployment. They want less money spent on general government administration. They want more on roads. They want more on sport and they want more on education. They want more on retraining and age pensions but the one that comes out the highest where they want the most is the environment. They want a 115 per cent change&mdash;an increase in spending on the environment. That is what this particular report is all about. It is important that the recommendations in this report are looked at closely. They give a guide to what will happen in the future and I believe they can create many thousands of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was disappointed to hear what happened in one area in Victoria. Some time ago money was going to be put into a wind farm at Kilcunda, in south Gippsland. A firm was already allocated to build it. However, Jeffrey Kennett decided to scotch that. He said that we have got abundant electricity from Latrobe Valley&mdash;which we have&mdash;and he did not think it was necessary to put in one of these wind generators. To me that was an absolute disgrace. The amount of power that actually comes out of brown coal was referred to recently in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. For 100 per cent of brown coal put in, what is wasted is about 60 per cent. We get only a 40 per cent return from the brown coal that goes in. Mr Kennett and his people are promoting this and therefore not only using up a valuable resource but also ruining our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to go to the Latrobe Valley to find that the people who still have jobs and work there&mdash;Mr Kennett sacked about 10,000 of them, or some other huge number&mdash;have to live under very harsh conditions because of the pollution. I know the state government is taking steps to improve it. However, it has sold off part of our electricity generating area. I am quite certain that the power companies that have bought it will not be interested in looking after the environment; they are interested only in getting a quick buck and returning it to their American shareholders. To me, the removal by Jeffrey Kennett of the wind farm program was wrong. The program should be reinstated. The technology is there to get a return from wind power, which should be promoted as much as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am responding to the joint statement by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) and the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) on the International Conference on Population and Development recently held in Cairo. They spoke about the consensus reached at the conference and the real part Australia played in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege of attending the conference, which was a major world event, on behalf of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). My colleagues have informed us that the conference has produced a global program of action on population and development. For the first time there is international agreement that countries need to make positive investments to improve the social and economic conditions of their populations, and especially the conditions of women. We have heard that there are specific strategies for empowering women to participate equally with men in the development process. These strategies include actions to improve women's health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is at the forefront in developments in women's health and we have already put in place many of the strategies which were recommended by the conference. Australia, for example, is one of the few countries to have a national women's health policy. In 1989, following consultations in one way or another with over one million women, the government launched the national women's health policy. The goals of the policy are to improve the health and wellbeing of all women in Australia, with a focus on those most at risk, and to encourage the health system to be more responsive to the needs of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to report that sexual and reproductive health, a major action area in the Cairo program of action, has already been identified as one of the priority health issues for women in Australia. Thus Australia's national women's health program has funded over 360 projects throughout the nation, providing innovative women's health services, information and training, including health promotion, counselling and support services to victims of sexual assault and violence, ethnic liaison services and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairo program of action put forward strategies for addressing the specific needs of indigenous people. I am pleased to be able to report that over 10 per cent of projects funded under the national women's health program are targeted to indigenous women. I praise the efforts of our diplomats and our negotiators who managed to ensure that that issue of indigenous people remained as part of the general agenda in Cairo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Empowerment of women and freedom of choice in relation to health services were two important themes in Cairo. One area in which women have demanded greater choice is that of birthing services. The government responded to this by establishing the alternative birthing services program in 1989. This program recognises that pregnancy and childbirth are, in the majority of cases, normal life events requiring minimal intervention. As a result of this program, some hospitals have significantly modified their birthing practices, resulting in fewer interventions and more control by women themselves over the birthing process. It is to be hoped that this trend will continue and that for all healthy women the alternative birthing service will become the norm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairo program of action put forward a wide range of strategies to address women's morbidity and mortality. In Australia breast cancer and cancer of the cervix are major health issues for women. In 1991 the government introduced screening programs aimed at reducing mortality from breast and cervical cancers. The national program for the early detection of breast cancer, which formally commenced in July 1991, is establishing a network of accredited screening and assessment services across the country. There are currently 28 screening and assessment services operated from 87 units. Seventeen of these are mobile. It is expected that the program will be fully operational by 1996-97, when it aims to screen 1.1 million women in the target age group of 50 to 69 every two years. The government also aims to ensure that the treatment and care of women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer are the very best quality by world standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the Commonwealth government introduced the organised approach to preventing cancer of the cervix. Future directions in this program can be summed up in two words&mdash;participation and quality. Only 50 to 60 per cent of Australian women in the target age group of 18 to 69 years of age are adequately screened. It is crucial to increase these numbers when we consider that without the program there would be an estimated 1,700 new cases of cervical cancer every year. There will be more announcements about this program later this year and early next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairo program of action placed a strong emphasis on making family planning services widely available. In Australia the government has funded a national family planning program for over 15 years. It has established a network of sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning information, education, training, counselling and clinical activities throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most members would have seen media reports about the abortion issue in the Cairo conference. The program of action states clearly and explicitly that in no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. This is consistent with Australia's policy on family planning. Australia believes that satisfying the demand for family planning services will reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and reduce the need for women to resort to abortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Cairo document also stresses the rights of choice and non-coercion in family planning programs. In Australia this is translated not only into the service provided but also in the very choice of the service providers&mdash;state and territory family planning associations, general practitioners, hospital postnatal wards, natural family planning centres and community and women's health centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia fully supports the stance of the program of action resulting from the International Conference on Population and Development which recognises abortion as an important health issue for women, particularly the disastrous health impact of unsafe abortions. Of particular concern is the fact that in developing countries up to 500 women die each day from the complications of unsafe abortions and many more are seriously injured. Recognising there can be compelling health reasons for women to seek to terminate a pregnancy, the government has therefore provided financial support within the health system to allow access to voluntary legal and safe abortion. This is consistent with the Cairo program of action which states that where abortion is not against the law countries should ensure that such abortion is safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program of action specifically directs countries actively to discourage the harmful practice of female genital mutilation. The extent to which this occurs in Australia is not yet known but there are increasing numbers of migrants from countries where it is practised. In June this year, the Family Law Council published a report on female genital mutilation. The government is currently considering legislative options as well as sensitively targeted education with relevant communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has already given high priority to many of the goals of the program of action and the targets are more than met but some challenges still remain. While Australia meets international standards, it needs to continue to address the needs of particular groups, such as indigenous people and those from non-English speaking backgrounds, to enable them to enjoy the same high standards of health care as the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Conference on Population and Development had a single overarching focus that transcended religious and cultural differences. It was the focus to achieve social justice for all humanity. In the speech that I gave at the parliamentary level conference, I pointed this out. Notwithstanding the enormous cultural diversity that we have, it is still possible for all human beings to come together on certain fundamental principles of human rights and certain fundamental principles of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some initial conflict at the conference in relation to what would be agreed and what would not be agreed. There were some divisions, as was bound to be the case with more than 160 countries. A lot of the media publicity that occurred prior to the conference and even during the conference proved not to be accurate when it came to the final situation of resolving the issues. An overwhelming number of those nations agreed to the document. Even when some people objected to specific clauses&mdash;and there were very few countries that did that&mdash;they cooperated. For example, His Holiness the Pope had some reservations, as one would expect, in relation to the abortion issue and other aspects concerning reproductive health. Notwithstanding that, it was important that the Vatican and all the Catholic countries and an overwhelming number of the Muslim countries agreed to the document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have had a very interesting and very important lesson taught us in Cairo. That is, there are a lot of people who are prepared to emphasise the differences between nations and the differences between cultures as if they are a negative, as if they prevent the possibility of people coming together to agree on basic principles of social justice. This conference proved that people can have agreement on basic principles of social justice, notwithstanding the huge cultural diversity and ethnic diversity that exists in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was an historic conference and I was very proud to be there, to represent Australia and to be able to participate in the events. I might say that Australia was thanked on a number of occasions and one that I want to mention involved the Pacific island countries. The minister was unable to be present at the reception and I hosted the reception for the Pacific island countries on his behalf. What was very important was that the representatives from those countries thanked Australia because they were only able to participate in the conference because of a significant contribution by Australia towards the cost of getting their delegations there. This was a very important contribution that Australia made because, as we know, population issues and issues concerning birth control and issues concerning women's health are all significant matters in these nations. The people there were very appreciative of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I want to mention is a very important reception we had when the Australian delegation invited representatives from other delegations to the Australian Embassy in Cairo. We had a very good turnout. The organiser of the conference, the wonderful lady Nafis Sadik, who is the United Nations representative on population issues, did us the honour of attending the reception, which I had the honour of hosting. She had organised what I think was the largest UN conference held so far&mdash;it was certainly just as large, and some say it was larger, than Rio. She spent a lot of time with our diplomats and representatives, and I think that there was a great appreciation of the role that Australia played from the beginning in all of the negotiations leading up to the conference and in helping to achieve a very good result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The noble principles of social justice are increasingly being heard throughout the world. The reason is, I believe, that social justice is a critical element in the very definition of basic human rights. When it came to the point, we had to decide in the charter whether we were going to actually implement a number of specific issues that related directly to the international declaration of human rights or whether we were going to walk away from that declaration. It was a positive conference&mdash;I think that fact has not been sufficiently emphasised&mdash;the determinations of which reinforced the declaration. </PARA>
