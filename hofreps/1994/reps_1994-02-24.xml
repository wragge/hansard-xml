<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House insists on disagreeing to the amendment insisted on by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) contains three provisions which all aim at greater equity between various groups of disabled veterans, various categories of pensioners and the assessment of various forms of investments. This bill would enable veterans severely disabled by reason of their war service and who receive an extreme disablement adjustment to receive support for the education of their children through the veterans' children education scheme. The longer the delay, the longer the children of certain severely disabled veterans are denied the benefits available to children of other categories of disabled veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second provision is shares and listed securities. The bill aims to place the assessment of overseas investments on the same footing as investments in Australia. Existing provisions could encourage people in receipt of a service pension to evade the constraints of the income and assets test by investing in offshore ventures. This measure has already been implemented under the Social Security Act. Failure to pass the bill prolongs the discrepancy in the income and assets test applied by the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security respectively. It also has the potential to discourage small-scale investment in Australian companies at a time when such investment is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third provision is allocated pensions and annuities. The bill standardises the treatment of allocated pensions and annuities with that of other forms of managed investments. The Senate amendment will reduce the equity of the service pension income and assets test. Pensioners with the same means and the same financial resources available to them should have the same amount of income and assets assessed for service pension purposes. People who invest in allocated pensions or allocated annuities should not be treated more beneficially than those who invest in other managed investments. The early passage of this measure would eliminate a number of inconsistencies and anomalies arising from the current treatment of allocated pensions and annuities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already mentioned on two other occasions, when this matter has come before the House and then been sent back to us from the Senate, the government has committed itself to a whole review of both veterans' pensions and social security pensions. The reality is that we cannot have these inconsistencies in place. The opposition talks about management and consistency in management, yet when we have a bill before us which would make the management of these pensions across the board consistent what happens? The opposition insists on inconsistencies and mismanagement, which will effectively be the case if these provisions are not passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Moncrieff knows that there has been a review audit. The review is proceeding to look at all these issues for not only service pensioners but all pensioners. We have said, `Let's pass this legislation, let's pass these rules, so as to give continuity and additional benefits to certain veterans'. When we have passed this legislation and achieved consistency, we can look at the whole issue when the report of the review comes down. We will make determinations across the board for pensioners. That is what we should do if we want consistent administration, and that is all we have asked for. The Senate is quite mistaken in insisting in the majority on this inconsistency continuing, and the government will persist in its determination in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(McPherson)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (9.38 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a further step in the ongoing saga of the treatment of a whole range of pensioners' investments. I would like to take the opportunity to say once again&mdash;it is at least the 100th time I have said it in this place&mdash;that we do not share the government's enthusiasm for attacking pensioners in this way. I take the point of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Dr Theophanous) that a review is going on. We are aware of that. The shadow minister for social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), has expressed a number of concerns about the sorts of issues that that review should look at. Hopefully, in the end, it will come up with some recommendations that we can support which will change the assets test in particular and the incomes test in a way that takes account of the circumstances out in the real world which have changed so dramatically, particularly with interest rates coming down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view, the treatment of allocated pensions, managed investments, shares and a whole range of issues has never been satisfactory. In every case we have argued that this has disadvantaged a significant number of pensioners, and we still hold that view. The argument that the parliamentary secretary put forward this morning in the veterans area that this will make this legislation consistent with other legislation, in my view, does not answer the objections we have to do it at all. It may be an excuse for changing the veterans affairs legislation, but it is only an excuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument does not address the fundamental issue. The attempt to treat these sorts of investments in a way that somehow takes account of the gains in their value that do not translate into part of a pensioner's income is obviously flawed. We have had this argument so many times, but it has continually fallen on deaf ears. The opposition spokesman is not in the chamber at the moment, so speaking on behalf of the opposition and veterans&mdash;and, Mr Speaker, you would be aware of my interest in these matters and my desire to take every opportunity to pursue these issues&mdash;I indicate that we do not accept this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say what I have said before: even if there were an argument&mdash;I say it is an excuse&mdash;for changing the veterans' legislation to bring it in line with the social security legislation, I would be prepared to argue in this place that veterans should be treated differently to others. They are treated differently. Veterans in this country are concerned all the time about the way they are treated by this government and the way their benefits are constantly downgraded. As the veterans become less of a political force by sheer diminishing numbers, I am quite sure there will be an ongoing attack on them to diminish their importance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The attack so far has come consistently from the government side of the House. I am concerned that over time people tend to forget the service these people have given our country. I am thinking particularly of the older veterans, but also the veterans of my generation&mdash;the Vietnam veterans&mdash;and a new range of veterans from the more recent conflicts such as the Gulf War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, veterans have a very special place in this country and we should not forget that. I will argue in this place at every opportunity for the special treatment and recognition of veterans and the setting aside and quarantining of their benefits. The suggestion being made is that because we treat social security pensioners and their managed investments, allocated pensions and share portfolios in this way&mdash;something we have been consistently opposed to&mdash;we should now do the same for veterans. In my view that does not carry weight at all. It was wrong to treat social security pensioners in that way and it is equally wrong to treat veteran pensioners in that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly I take this opportunity to apologise for the Leader of National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the opposition spokesman for veterans' affairs, not being here. He is in Lockhart this morning. I thank the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) for very ably addressing this issue on behalf of the opposition. I take this opportunity to affirm what the honourable member for McPherson has said: we are very strongly of the view that the amendment made in the Senate should be retained. We believe that the House should accept that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the amendment was essentially to maintain the status quo for the assets and income testing of veterans until we have the results of the independent inquiry that the government has agreed is appropriate into income and assets testing generally. We see no necessity to make changes to bring the veterans' arrangements into line with what we regard as the lowest common denominator which is operating in the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which assets and income testing is undertaken in the Department of Veterans' Affairs is considerably different to the way in which it is being undertaken in the Department of Social Security. The way in which the recipients of benefits who have modest investments either in managed investments or in shares are treated in respect of those investments is quite different not because of the legislative arrangements but, I suspect, because of the way in which one department treats its clients as against the way in which another department treats its clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very interested to learn that, in relation to managed investments and shares where changes are being undertaken in accordance with the new legislative regime that operates in the Department of Social Security, clients are not given any particulars about the way in which reductions to their benefits are occasioned. There is no listing of their portfolio and no advice is given as to the manner in which calculations are undertaken to effect a reduction. The department, which I understand buys information from advisers as to variations to the capital value of managed investments or shares, gives no advice as to what information has been provided to it. The clients are simply given advice by the department that a change has been effected. When the Department of Veterans' Affairs makes these arrangements it gives all that information and the calculations to its clients so that they are in a position to check the information they have against the information that is held by the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is clear that, in areas that are not directly related to this legislation but which relate to the way in which the legislation is intended to operate, the departments already use totally different means of calculating these arrangements where one would expect a common approach. So we have to ask ourselves why, at this point in time, the veterans' affairs legislation has to be brought into line with the Department of Social Security legislation if the departments separately administering these matters use different procedures and provide different information not because of any statutory differences but simply as a matter of practice. Why do we have to bring them both into line when clearly they have different administrative arrangements in place to satisfy their administrative needs for their client base?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a briefing, for which I thank the government, from the consultant who has been asked to undertake this independent inquiry. It is interesting that, while I personally have doubts about the ambitious nature of the program for the review that the consultant has set having regard to the nature of the very considerable task that has to be undertaken, the consultant seems to believe that he will be able to expedite the process. He is talking about bringing forward the date for the preliminary report, which will be made public, from July to June. He is hopeful that he may be able to speed up the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether that is right or whether it is wrong in terms of what will be the end result, but the whole issue of this inquiry has of course been in the government's hands. The inquiry was announced last November. If the government was of the view that it wanted to get these matters sorted out quickly, it could have got its consultants in place even earlier than was outlined in the announcements of the last week or so. It could have been up and running with the task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the delays with the inquiry to this point and all of the doubts about the timetable that has been set are in the government's hands. The opposition's view of this legislation and of social security legislation&mdash;I have made this clear before&mdash;is that we will not accommodate any amendments to assets and income testing until such time as the independent inquiry has undertaken its review and the government is in a position to give effect to the substantive results that we believe will come from that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our view, the system of assets testing, particularly as it relates to unrealised capital gains and the treatment of managed investments, is harsh, unconscionable, unfair and has already produced quite different results between beneficiaries. We do not believe that the amendments proposed for veterans will achieve a fairer and more equitable system in terms of the major issues that need to be addressed. For that reason we believe there needs to be a cooling-off period, a proper and cooperative approach taken to the review, the substantial issues need to be addressed and then we can look at amendments to both veterans' affairs legislation and social security legislation in light of that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than this ping-pong between the Senate and the House of Representatives, we would encourage the government to accept the amendment of the Senate to get the legislation up and running on the other matters that have been dealt with and essentially agreed. There is no need for any continuation of this matter. The government needs to know of our resolve to see this matter through. I suggest to the government that the easiest and simplest solution at this time would be to accept the amendments and allow the rest of the proposed changes to the veterans' affairs legislation to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already made a number of comments about the government's position. It is very clear. On the question of the review, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) would be interested in a couple of matters. The government is trying to expedite the review, although within the parameter of making sure that we achieve a result. It is interesting that the honourable member expressed some concern that it might be brought forward from July to June, yet the day before yesterday when we discussed this measure at least one opposition person said that the review should be expedited and brought forward. This is another example of inconsistent presentation on the part of the opposition in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review involves consultants, and people in the community&mdash;pensioners and ex-service, community and ethnic organisations&mdash;will be consulted. People have also been asked to provide submissions to the review. Rather than just having a chat with the head of the review, I suggest that, if the honourable member has actual concerns about the implementation of the measures that are in place in the social security area, for example, he would do well to make a submission to the review listing these problems to ensure that they are taken into account. I urge him to do so if he is genuinely interested in an outcome of the review which does take account of all the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that the review committee includes Mrs June Healy, national secretary of the Returned Services League, who was nominated by the RSL to ensure that veterans' interests are represented. I say once again that we do need consistency between the two acts for veterans and other social security beneficiaries.

<PARA>This is the third time I have repeated in this House the government's reasons for accepting the amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). I remind the House that if this amendment is again rejected, we will provide a basis for a double dissolution in relation to this bill. I urge the opposition to seriously consider what it is doing before it again rejects this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires full passage to implement beneficial changes to service pension assessment and to continue the pension assessment link with the Social Security Act. The Senate opposes the managed investment amendments contained in the bill. The opposition wants to delay these amendments until the independent review of the income and assets tests for service and social security pensions hands down its report. The opposition claims that there are winners and losers resulting from the managed investment proposals. The three managed investment proposals contained in this bill are all beneficial to service pensioners with this form of investment. In fact, the beneficial nature of the amendments is demonstrated by the proposals being backdated to commence from 1 April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first proposal clarifies the operation of the Veterans' Entitlements Act by ensuring that all losses from managed investments can be offset against profits from other managed investments. The second measure ensures that, where an investment has been held for less than 12 months and only an interim rate of return has been declared, that rate will be maintained as the annual rate of return. The third measure addresses the effect on certain investments caused by industry changes to friendly societies. Where the friendly society converts to a life office and the conditions of the investment remain substantially the same, this measure will safeguard these investments by preserving the current assessment rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition wishes to delay these measures until after the review. The review will examine the conceptual framework, design, principles and actual operation of the income and assets tests as they apply to social security, age disability support and sole parents' pensions and to the veterans' affairs service pension. Also part of the review's role will be to examine the relationship between the income and assets tests and the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that we need these measures to give consistency across government departments until the process of the review is completed and we will then look at consistent changes, if they are required, in both areas. That is what we have been saying throughout. For the opposition to insist that no changes be made in the veterans' area when changes have been made in the social security area is to insist on this contradiction between the two areas which cannot be allowed to continue if we are to have consistent government administration. We therefore insist that we continue with these changes and we insist that the changes be accepted. That is the position of the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, as you may have anticipated, the opposition will not agree to the amendment to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). Let me make this abundantly clear: if the government had really been talking about consistency in relation to its administration, it would have implemented the amendments to the veterans' affairs legislation at the same time that it implemented changes to the social security legislation. It did not see fit to do so. It brought the changes in at a separate time on a separate basis in separate legislation. It saw no necessity for consistency in terms of application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of social security these changes were made to managed investments and the financial impact was detailed by the government to be negligible. Their operation in the Department of Social Security produced an outcome whereby some people owning managed investments have received significant reductions in their entitlements while other social security beneficiaries may have received modest increases. According to my recollection, the first adjustments that were made produced fairly modest changes in both directions, but the later adjustments that were made&mdash;particularly as there were significant increases in the value of the all-ordinaries index of share prices&mdash;led to a far more draconian impact than was at first envisaged by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government is saying that it wants to bring the veterans' affairs legislation into line with the Department of Social Security legislation. The impact of this legislation was adverse for some and positive for others, but when the government applies the same test for the veterans' affairs legislation it wants us to believe that there will only be winners. I do not know how the scheme that we are being told we are implementing here, which in terms of application will be consistent with that of the Department of Social Security, will only produce winners when the same scheme has produced winners and losers. It does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure&mdash;because the government wants to make this an issue between the Senate and the House of Representatives&mdash;to implement other aspects of the veterans' affairs legislation may have an adverse impact, but let it be clearly understood that any adverse impact of the failure to implement or to pass the balance of the legislation is on the government's head, not on the head of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to assets testing, if the government wants to make an issue of the question of unrealised capital gains on shares and its proposals for treating managed investments in the same way as it treats unrealised capital gains on shares, and if it wants to have an election on that matter, it should bring it on. We will fight it on that issue. If the government thinks that is the most important issue upon which its future depends, it should bring it on. Let us have a double dissolution now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be clearly understood that these matters are important to the opposition. We believe that there ought to be an interregnum so the inquiry can be fully pursued and that the status quo in relation to these matters ought to remain. As I said earlier in a debate on another bill, the way in which the Department of Veterans' Affairs has implemented the issue of assets testing and the approach in relation to clients is quite different from the approach taken by the Department of Social Security. It has nothing to do with the legislation that is before the House; it simply does it differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the government did not see fit to make these amendments in legislation dealing with the Social Security Act. If it had seen that these two pieces of legislation ought to be in tandem, that they ought to sit and run together, that changes ought to be effected at the same time and in the same way, it could have implemented that legislation in that way at that time. But the government saw fit to bring it in later, after it had announced the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our view is that the status quo ought to remain. We do not see any hardship in relation to that. We believe that the government should accept the amendments of the Senate and pass the balance of the bill forthwith. It ought to await the outcome of the independent inquiry, when I am sure that on any balanced consideration of income and assets testing the result will be significant suggestions for reform and change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) is good at shouting about these matters, but when it comes to logic he is somewhat wanting. His problem is that the changes in relation to managed investments in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) are all positive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we said, an inquiry is taking place into the whole question of assets and managed investments. But each measure in this bill is positive for service pensioners. Because the opposition wants to make a point about its position with respect to managed investments, it has rejected this bill, but the bill is all positive. The honourable member has said that the overall impact in the Department of Social Security is negative for some and positive for others. That is not in issue in this bill. The three measures in this bill are all positive. The government has decided to backdate these measures to 1 April 1993 so that they can have a positive impact for service pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the argument from the honourable member for Berowra is quite flawed. If the opposition wants to take up the principle, it should make a substantial submission to the review. It should put its position in relation to these issues. All it does is say that it opposes this and that. It has not put a comprehensive position in relation to assets and managed investments and pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is trying to make a political issue out of this matter. As a consequence, veterans who will benefit from this legislation will miss out. This is very positive legislation for veterans. It is a very sad day when, to make a political point, the opposition comes to the view that it will reject a bill which contains positive measures for veterans.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support these appropriation bills because they are an essential part of the government's fiscal policy. It is a crucial part of this government's strategy and policy to create jobs and to generate growth and exports for this country. At the outset, let me congratulate the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) on an outstanding first speech. Let me also assure him that he will have my full support for his efforts to obtain an international airport at Badgerys Creek. Indeed, I am Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works and my committee recommended this and it was a great pity that the government did not take up our recommendation. I agree with his comments that this project represents the best opportunity for industry clustering and employment growth in Sydney's west and south-west in the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated my support to him for Badgerys Creek, I am sure he would also support me in my efforts to obtain a new link road from the coast to the highlands and also for the completion of the Maldon-Dombarton rail link, because he knows that these projects would complement the other and we must look not only at the south-west of Sydney but indeed at the south-west of New South Wales. I am sure that the honourable member for Werriwa will have a long and distinguished career in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's great export, coal, is under considerable threat at the moment. No industry has been more restructured and no workers have made a bigger contribution to this restructuring than the coalminers. Yet, jobs in the industry today are under greater threat than ever before. This, in no small measure, is because of the inability of the producers, especially in relation to coking coal, to maintain existing prices and volume from the Japanese buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a few weeks ago they were called from their luxury hotels in Tokyo to the centralised negotiating team, also in Tokyo. After BHP caved in on prices, the other producers had no option but to follow them. In the past, when prices dropped there could be a volume increase, thus maintaining the share of the market, but this time they caved in on both prices and volumes. This will cost Australia some $370 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is far too important to the economy of Australia, to our export earnings, to be left in the hands of the producers alone. A national coal authority should be established to oversee and coordinate negotiations between Australian coal exporters and overseas buyers, especially the Japanese authorities, in order to achieve better pricing outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should also be developed a national role in the management and development of Australia's coal reserves and in the issue of new coalmining leases. It is not exaggerating to say that there has been more coal sterilised in Australia than will ever be mined. This coal is lost forever to this country. This has been caused not only by poor mining methods but also because we have never had a national plan for the development of coal reserves in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Mine Workers, who will be rallying outside this building next week, are calling on the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) to set up an inquiry, to be chaired by a prominent person, into the effects on the industry of coal price settlements. Terms of reference could be established after consultation. Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, I know that you support this call, as do I, for the establishment by the government of a special fund to assist displaced mine workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often hear the argument that a centralised marketing body for coal would not work. Yet many of those putting this argument have no difficulty with a centralised meat authority, a centralised wheat authority and, until it became unpopular, a centralised wool authority. The Japanese are used to dealing with a centralised authority. It is not as if we are dealing with a small amount. For example, of the 129 million tonnes of coal exported last year, 64 million tonnes went to the Japanese. It is far and away our most important export for coal. As I have stressed, the Japanese are used to dealing with centralised authorities; they themselves negotiate with the owners from a centralised position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the difficulties in this industry, the competitive situation in the world and new entries into the market, there will be changes in the industry and the miners will accommodate these as they have accommodated changes in the past. But they do have an entitlement to some form of security in their employment, especially as they have been in the forefront of restructuring. The coalminers have accepted changed work practices, retrenchments, relocation and mine closures in order to obtain greater efficiency in the industry. They have also accepted them in the so far vain hope that these miners who remain in the industry will have some long-term security of employment. They have made the Australian coal industry a world leader in its field, and this should be duly recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representing as I do the port of Kembla, I am concerned about the future of Australian shipping. It is nothing short of a national disgrace that Australian exports in the main are not carried by Australian shipping. Indeed, less than five per cent of our exports are transported under Australian flagships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some argue that because so little Australian produce is carried in Australian ships, we should sell off what remains of the fleet. Such a view is short-sighted in the extreme. This has never stopped the economic rationalists in the past. The age of world shipping is increasing. Within a few years there will be a massive shortage of world shipping. Indeed, if we started building today there would still be a shortage. This shortage will apply not only to vessels but also crews, especially officers. What is our response to this emerging crisis in world shipping? The response for many in Australia is to sell off what ships we have and to open even further the Australian coastline to the ageing rust buckets of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few countries are as dependent on shipping for their export revenue as Australia. We should be investigating urgently the possibility of shipbuilding in Australia. I wonder what has happened to the report on the shipbuilding industry entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the wake of the `Bounty'</EMPHASIS>, a report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology tabled in this chamber in May 1982. Why was it allowed to sink without trace?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes I wonder whether indeed we are the clever country. We most certainly are not a very adventurous country, especially when it comes to investment. We are not good at responding to challenges, forward thinking or planning. If we were good at forward thinking and planning, we would realise that Australia will be hit harder than most by the world shortage of shipping. We should be embarking on a shipbuilding project in Australia now, preferably at Port Kembla, as was recommended in that report. For those who say that it is too expensive to build ships in Australia, my response is: look at some of the shipbuilding nations now. Last June I inspected a shipbuilding yard on the outskirts of Copenhagen in Denmark. Their wage structure and work conditions are very similar to ours. In fact, their wage structure is slightly higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular yard had one ship being built and another ship on the order book. They would never start building one ship until they had another one in the order book. They have continually been able to do this. If they can do it with their higher wage structure, I do not see why Australia could not do it. Even Japan's wage structure rivals ours. Finland, with a wage structure even higher than ours, has embarked on a shipbuilding project. So much for those who say we cannot compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my comments on a matter of particular interest and concern to me&mdash;the recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. I do not want to say anything that might increase tensions between various communities in Australia. We in this country, whatever our background, have always prided ourselves that people have come from many troubled parts of the world to this country and not brought their problems with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disturbed at recent activities in Melbourne concerning the property of both Macedonians and Greeks. I appeal to those on both sides not to do or say anything that would increase tension. This appeal must go to those who occupy positions of responsibility in the community, such as the New South Wales Minister for Ethnic Affairs. I thought his statement condemning the federal government's recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia was not only unwise but also uncalled for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if Australia is the first and only country to recognise the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. In fact, we have been amongst the last. We waited feebly until the Europeans recognised Macedonia. It was only after the United States moved to recognise Macedonia that Australia belatedly followed suit. So much for an independent foreign policy!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have unfortunately placed restrictions on the opening of a consular office. I find this strange. I would urge that this consular office be opened as quickly as possible. I represent many Macedonians and I know the difficulty that they have faced in recent years over getting a visa when they wanted to visit the land of their birth or, indeed, as do many people who come from overseas, they wanted to arrange property settlements there. There has been a great difficulty in doing this because there have not been consular facilities in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it rather strange that we are demanding that they not display their flag or any other symbol. It would be like an Australian coat of arms without the kangaroo or emu being displayed and the flag that we share with several other countries, including New Zealand, not being displayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Macedonians are not to display their ethnicity, it is a wonder that we did not ask them to change their language. We are quibbling over the name Macedonia. What language are we going to say they speak? Are we going to deny that the Macedonians speak Macedonian? It is a nonsense. If a country is having a dispute with another country about the flag or the symbols&mdash;and I know that there are strong feelings on both sides about these issues&mdash;that is between those two countries. Australia has no role in taking one side or the other, regardless of the pressure that may be exerted by various community groups. </PARA>

I urge Greece to lift the embargo against Macedonia and to open the port of Salonika to enable supplies to get to Macedonia. Given the size and population of Macedonia, it is ludicrous to say that it has territorial claims on Greece. Macedonia wants only to live in peace and harmony with its neighbours, and we should encourage that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to participate in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). These bills deal with the money matters that directly affect the government and every Australian. Because of the wide ranging nature of these bills, it is inevitable that debate tends to range across a number of issues. I note with interest that my friend the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has just dealt with the coal industry, the shipping industry, linguistics and foreign affairs within the ambit of this debate, and quite appropriately so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will attempt to confine my remarks principally to the issues of taxation. But, in my opening comments, I want to reflect on the principal appropriation issue currently affecting this chamber: that is, the question of the so-called sports rorts and the involvement of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I am prompted to make a comment not merely because these are appropriation bills but also because of the remarks attributed to Senator Richardson earlier this week. He was critical of the opposition's criticism of the sports rorts affair because&mdash;as Senator Richardson said&mdash;after all, all the minister has done is ensure that the poorest electorates receive the most attention through this particular scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot let that remark go unchallenged. Had it been a fact that the poorest electorates were represented by the ALP and had therefore attracted the greatest portion of the funding, I would have no grounds for my criticism, but the simple and frequently forgotten reality is that the poorest electorates in Australia are represented by members of the coalition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HE4">Mr ANDREW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Moncrieff said, regrettably she represents one of those electorates, and so do I. My electorate, on a range of median incomes, is the 10th poorest electorate in Australia. All but two of the 10 poorest electorates in Australia are represented by members of the opposition. As a matter of fact, all but four of the 20 poorest electorates in Australia are represented by members of the coalition and all but 11 of the 40 poorest are represented by the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of that simple reality, we cannot escape the fact that the poorest electorate in Australia, based on median family income, the electorate of Wide Bay, received about $50,000 from the sports grants scheme. I believe that the electorate of Canberra, represented by the minister, received $450,000. So there are no grounds for Senator Richardson's claim that there was some sort of equity in the distribution of this money. Clearly, the electorates represented by people on this side of the House are the poorest of all, based on median family incomes. We are the people who have failed because of the way this scheme has been jaundiced. We have failed to attract appropriate funding for our electorates not for want of adequate representation but because clearly that representation was put under the eye of the minister, who manipulated the scheme to suit her and the government's particular ends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that the appropriation of moneys under the sports rorts scheme can be said to have been on the basis of need. Such an argument cannot be defended and should not be advanced by members of the government, particularly someone of Senator Richardson's status. I stand here, as does the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), representing more than my share of people whose incomes are below the national average. It is on behalf of some of those people that I want to address my remarks in this appropriation debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that this is all a one-sided debate. I am not suggesting that everything that we stand for is white and that everything the government stands for is black. The argument is never quite like that. As a matter of fact, in recognition of some of the needs in my electorate, the government initiated an inquiry into horticultural practice in Australia. This week, the horticultural task force, headed by Senator Sherry, handed down its report. I welcome that report and many of its recommendations. I point out for the benefit of the House that, in the election campaign, the opposition proposed to initiate such an inquiry itself. It was in response to that opposition initiative that the government set up its inquiry under Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does Senator Sherry recommend to assist the fruit growers in my electorate and some of those in rural areas who earn incomes far below the national median? One of the things Senator Sherry is recommending, which I endorse, is that new horticultural plantings ought to attract some form of tax deductibility. Under the present arrangements&mdash;as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, may be aware, given the nature of your electorate&mdash;tax deductibility is available wherever trees are put in the ground as replacements for existing plantings, but it is not available where trees are put in the ground as part of a new planting area. If the government is serious about ensuring that horticulture makes a net contribution of $2 billion to our overseas income by the year 2000, then this sort of initiative is what we need. I cannot stand here this morning and commend the government. All that has happened is that Senator Sherry has recommended that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) ought to introduce into the budget provisions that would allow for tax deductibility on new horticultural plantings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in this tax deductibility&mdash;as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will be&mdash;because both of our electorates have prominent wine grape growing areas. Quite a controversy was raging following the last budget, when the government proposed to lift the tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent and subsequently negotiated that back to a figure of 26 per cent on the grounds that it would offer the wine industry a package of reforms. Among those reforms was the proposal to allow tax deductibility for the planting of new vineyards. It was that particular reform that gave impetus to this call for tax deductibility for horticultural plantings as well. While the government may have been well intentioned in offering tax deductibility for the planting of vineyards, what it did was open a Pandora's box. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office was besieged by people, particularly dried fruit growers, who said, `How will the government determine whether the sultana vines I plant are being planted for wine production or dried fruit production?'. Even if we were able&mdash;I do not know how&mdash;to negotiate that particular minefield, what do I say to my other dried fruit growers who may be planting Elberta peach trees, which could be for either juice production or dried fruit production? Why are they to be disadvantaged as dried fruit growers as opposed to the dried vine fruit growers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry and his horticultural team have recommended that the government take up this plea to provide an opportunity for tax deductibility to be offered for all new plantings, whether in the horticultural or viticultural area. It is this effort of tax equity that I recognise and applaud. I encourage the Treasurer, as he prepares the May budget statement, to pick up this particular recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, you would also be aware because of the controversy that surrounded the wine tax package that there was a small segment of the dealcoholised wine industry which was effectively disadvantaged because tax on it went from 10 per cent to 21 per cent. While it was later pruned back, that represented an effective rise of 110 per cent in taxation simply because these were dealcoholised Yet their segment of the marketplace was not with the alcoholic spirit production but in competing with fruit juices and grape juices. They now find themselves at a shelf price disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a question to the Treasurer I asked that he address this problem, and in fairness to the Treasurer I must say that that day he responded to me and indicated that he would take the matter up. But, rather like the issue of deductibility for plantings, we still have not had any specific action from the government. While I have this opportunity I call on the Treasurer to pick up the issue of the inequity that dealcoholised wine producers are currently facing and the relative inequity that will apply to horticultural production if he does not introduce the recommendations suggested by Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further recommendation made by Senator Sherry that I would like to commend him for and bring to the attention of the House is the proposal that fresh fruit juices ought not to attract sales tax. In terms of giving horticultural industry a bit of an impetus, that has a great deal to commend it, but it has even more to commend it in terms of tax equity. After all, if for a typical Australian breakfast people choose to put milk on their cereal they are putting on their cereal what is effectively a beverage which is regarded by the government as food, that is, whole milk. Whole white milk does not attract sales tax and neither should it. But if people choose at that same breakfast to take another&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McEwen is much too flippant. If people choose at that same breakfast to take another whole food product known as fresh 100 per cent fruit juice, which in terms of its food consistency is no different from milk, they are consuming a product that has a tax on it. So, in the interests of tax equity, if this government is serious, as the honourable member for McEwen so loudly proclaims it is, about tax equity and taxes on food, there ought not be a tax on 100 per cent pure fresh fruit juice. This recommendation made by the honourable member for McEwen's colleague Senator Sherry ought to be picked up and introduced by the government in the budget&mdash;not as suggested by the opposition, though we have long called for it, but as suggested by a member of the government Senator Sherry in a report handed down this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said in this horticultural product report that it believes that horticulture has the capacity to generate $2 billion of net export income by the year 2000. The viticultural section has already indicated its commitment to reaching a target of $1 billion in wine exports by the year 2000. I believe these targets are achievable if the government is prepared not simply to hand down reports that make people feel better about an industry but to take the action recommended in those reports and to take wider action to ensure that horticultural and viticultural practice in Australia is more competitive and more able to meet the sort of competition that it faces from fellow overseas producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other areas where I believe the government could do a great deal to assist horticultural producers. The first&mdash;and this it is a topical issue given that it has been in the news so much in the last 10 days&mdash;is the question of wharf reform. It is a question of recognising that it is not just a matter of producing and growing the product in Australia. It is a matter of getting it overseas at a competitive price and on time. At that point we have in the past the failed. The government has failed to take the positive action that producers deserve when they are prepared to produce quality export products. In the past producers have found their products sitting on the wharf failing to be delivered on time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue is the question of industrial relations. Of all industries in Australia, the industry that offers the most opportunity for value adding is the horticultural industry. The success of our value adding very much depends on the sorts of industrial relations policies we introduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I was interested, as you would have been, to hear your colleague the honourable member for Throsby indicate that the Finnish people had a successful shipbuilding industry with a wage structure not unlike ours. He implied that the opposition would in some way be offended by that and that the opposition's target was to cut people's wages in order to be competitive. He is wrong. There is no way the opposition has ever advocated lower wage rates for Australian employees. In fact we went into the last election saying that we did not mind how much Australian employees earned; the more they earned the better we liked it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Moncrieff has said, there was no ceiling, but it needed to be productivity related. We need to ensure that what we are producing is what people are being paid for. I relate this illustration to my comments about the horticultural industry because the real lesson for me in industrial relations came through my involvement in the horticultural industry. Horticultural fruit pickers, frequently much maligned and seen at the bottom end of the socioeconomic scale, were the people who found they made the most money when they were no longer paid on an hourly rate but paid for what they did. Suddenly the job became interesting, worth while and productive. Their incomes went up dramatically and so did the fruit growers' gross return and net return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition is saying is that whether people are building ships or producing oranges or wine they ought to be paid for what they do. The honourable member for Throsby's insinuation that we stood for pruning wages deserves to be rejected out of hand. If we are serious about reaching export targets, if we are serious about generating more income for Australia in terms of what we sell overseas, and particularly if we are serious about value adding to primary production, we need to be serious about deregulating our industrial relations structure and allowing people to be more productive and to earn more for being more productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice with pleasure that the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) is at the table. I was in the chair when he was making a contribution in this debate yesterday. The honourable member for Fraser is a member of the government for whom, I believe, all people have a great regard because he is courageous, he believes in what he says and he stands by what he believes in. The honourable member for Fraser in picking up the point that, in his view, we are the lowest taxed country in the OECD made a plea in his speech yesterday for some form of jobs levy because he wanted to see an opportunity for further jobs creation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the sincerity with which he made that plea but I reject it out of hand. Frankly, all that the opposition has been about and the focus of our remarks in relation to these bills is to ensure that Australian taxpayers are not frustrated with additional unnecessary tax burdens. I see an opportunity for jobs creation, whether in the horticultural area as outlined by Senator Sherry or in the viticultural area or in any other area of industrial production and export, as we build our industrial base and become a more productive country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I pick up the point made about the long-term unemployed. Much of our present unemployment is a reflection of the fact that we have not been about developing export markets and giving the opportunity for more Australians to be involved in a productive way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the comments made, for example, by the regional task force. Look at the comments made about the opportunities that exist in regional Australia for developing export markets. As I said, I recognise the sincerity with which the honourable member for Fraser called for a jobs levy. But the opposition has said that we should resist anything that frustrates Australian employers in employing people. That is why the opposition stood for the abolition of the payroll tax&mdash;because it is a tax that distinctly and deliberately discourages employers from employing people. We want to stand for a tax base which is fairly apportioned and which minimises the degree to which employers are discouraged from employing people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we been opposed to the differential between leaded and unleaded fuel? Because the productive base of Australia, its rural base, would be adversely affected by such a differential. Is it true, as the honourable member for Fraser contended yesterday, that we are the lowest taxed country around the globe? Of course it is not. We are the lowest taxed country relative to the OECD. We do have lower taxes than Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, Denmark or Austria but we certainly do not have a tax base dramatically lower than the USA, or North-East or South-East Asia. As soon as I say that, the government asks if I want a lifestyle like North-East or South-East Asia. No, I do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not proposing that our tax level should fall; I am suggesting that as it rises we lose the opportunity to be competitive. If we are serious about generating jobs, we need to be serious about Australia's competitive edge relative to those against whom we compete&mdash;the people of North-East and South-East Asia.

Indeed, I was very privileged for a period to chair the Melbourne Wholesale Fruit and Vegetable Market Trust. In that role I learnt a great deal about the Victorian horticultural industry and indeed other states' industries as they affected the wholesale supply of fruit and vegetables through the Melbourne market. I concur entirely with him on his general view that there is a long-term export future for Australian horticultural products, which I do not think many industry people fully understand.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the honourable gentleman, I am personally an interventionist and I believe government has a major role to play in sectoral intervention in certain industries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the purpose of my speech to the House today to talk about that. Rather, I want to look at the opposition's economic policies as they were outlined in Fightback, much of which has not been renounced by the opposition in this place, and as they are applied by the Kennett government in Victoria to see the net effect they have on the ordinary men, women and children of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can pick up a Victorian newspaper today, be it the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, and see a series of headlines which are quite frightening&mdash;for example, `Victoria worst hit in record long-term unemployment levels'. There is no doubt that today Victoria is the economic basket case of Australia because of the Kennett government's new right economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why are there so many long-term unemployed? One of the reasons is that 30,000 Victorians were put out of work by the Kennett government&mdash;a figure it does not deny. Not only are there currently 30,000 people out of work, but more people will be put out of work as a direct result of the Kennett philosophy, the Liberal Party philosophy, of economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not just my view. The Victorian Minister for Finance, Mr Ian Smith, has publicly admitted that much of the unemployment in Victoria is a direct result of the polices of the Kennett government. In regional and rural Victoria, which so many members of the opposition claim to represent and to have an affinity to, the statistics are nothing short of horrible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the Kennett government's economic view of the world is impacting more heavily on rural Victoria than on the city. In education, for example, in my own electorate 11 rural schools have now been closed. In the future a number of other schools will be forced to close, though the Kennett government will say that that is a community response and it is not closing the schools. They will close because the government has, for small one-teacher schools, fixed limits on the number of students before the school will stop receiving funding. We are talking here about very small schools; one-teacher schools, primarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not sound all that bad when one stands here and says that we can afford to close one school here and one school there, but in rural areas the loss of the school is not just the loss of the education facility. It is the loss of a teacher, the loss of the teacher's wage which will not be spent in the local area. So, the private sector feels that loss of income. It is the loss of the community meeting place. When people move to rural areas the first place of contact with the community, particularly for women with children, is the local school. All of us who have lived in country areas know this. It is an unarguable proposition. If we take away the country schools we impact on the community at large. The local school is where working bees are held, where the community comes together. If it is taken away the social structure of the community is changed immediately. Just in education alone there are now profound effects on rural Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to transport and the closure of railway lines, it is very strange that on the Melbourne-Sydney line, which runs through my electorate, the trains still run but they do not stop at the stations. It is rather odd that we have people who live in towns with a station who can no longer catch the train because the train does not stop, it goes past the station. The logic of that, quite frankly, totally escapes me. One of the arguments for closing rail links and reducing the rail service was to save money. Of course, the buses are private buses contracted out by the state government. But strangely enough we now find that the state government subsidises the private bus lines for pensioners and schoolchildren. So where are the savings? A good service is removed and replaced by buses that have to be subsidised by the state government in order to get them to work. It is an economic nightmare and an economic nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in the town of Euroa at the present time the train still stops, but they have closed the public toilets. It is mostly elderly people at Euroa who use the train. If they have a need to use a toilet at their local railway station, one would assume that there is toilet paper hanging on a tree outside the station&mdash;because the toilets are closed. This is the nightmare that rural people are facing as a result of the irrationality of the Kennett approach to economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Victoria has the highest rate of long-term unemployed in Australia. That is not an accident. What is happening in rural areas? The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Australia and all of the state government departments are shedding staff in rural towns and are closing down services. Again, we face the simple economic reality: less wages in the town, fewer people in the town and fewer children in the town, placing pressure on school closures and on local shopkeepers who lose the wage spending capacity of the public servants who once lived there, and the town starts to diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the research done in Victoria&mdash;I refer to research done by the Municipal Association of Victoria&mdash;is showing a massive decline in regional Victoria.

We keep hearing the Liberal Party softeners saying how they care for people, workers and wage levels, but what do they care about injured workers? It is pretty simple&mdash;3,200 injured workers lost their Workcare payments in Victoria in one blow, one fell swoop. We listened to their softness and caring about wage levels, but what did they do when they got government?

We do not know what we are going to get at the bottom end because it is not about a social program; it is about cutting money. </PARA>

Four deaths this year in Victoria are alleged to have been caused by poor ambulance service.

If we look at the $10 billion cuts proposed in Fightback, which have not been renounced in this place, we see that Kennett is applying those same policies. What do we find?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I accept your ruling. In the run-up to the last state election the Kennett government, with the support of Piers Ackerman, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS>, who must have been a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party, convinced the Victorian public that Victoria had outrageous debt levels and that because of this massive debt problem there was only one solution: to rip into the public purse. But, if one bothers to actually have a look at debt levels as a percentage of state gross domestic product in Victoria, we find that the Labor government left a debt percentage of state gross domestic product which was half of that of Sir Henry Bolte's.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Henry Bolte is seen by most Liberals in this place as one of the great Liberal leaders of Victoria. If we dared to suggest to the Liberal Party that he was a financial incompetent, it would attack us all over the place and say that he was the great white knight of Victorian liberalism. Under his regime, Victoria had twice the debt level as a percentage of state gross domestic product that the Labor government left. This is the nonsense that we get in economic debate in Victoria. Jeffrey Kennett, to his credit politically, has managed to convince people that this is the major problem. It is not, but because of that the Liberal government is getting away with these massive cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not disagree that there is a role for case-mix funding in hospitals, but case-mix funding can be carried out in a number of ways. Case-mix funding can recognise in its funding program and levels that smaller hospitals require contributions from the public purse to pick up those non-profit areas that occur in rural hospitals. The Minister for Health Services in Victoria, Marie Tehan, who happens to occupy a seat within my federal boundaries, has cut something like $480 million from the state health budget. According to Dr Robyn Mason of the Australian Medical Association, research done by the association shows that over 50 rural hospitals will close in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can argue that there should be some rationalisation of health care, and one can find good arguments for why we should look at the way in which we deliver health in economic terms, but rather than sit back and say `How can we achieve a health result and save money at the same time?' this government cuts and then tries to work out what will be left at the bottom. For example, Heathcote, in the shire of McIvor on the northern highway, has a small hospital with 10 acute beds. It will be closed within 12 months under the current system. What will happen to trauma patients? Is there any proposal to put forward a system of trauma patients being stabilised within the town before being transferred to a regional hospital? No, none at all. The hospital will close. Someone will then have to work out what to do with trauma patients. The northern highway is the major link between Echuca and Melbourne. It carries large numbers of tourist traffic and large numbers of traumas occur on that road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members may be interested to know that there are no longer any obstetric services in Heathcote. A pregnant woman has to go to Bendigo for all obstetric services&mdash;the caring Liberal approach to health that we hear so much of. Again, when the policy is applied we find that the town will not deliver the very basic medical requirement of most people&mdash;obstetrics. It is no longer there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seymour has a hospital and this year it is estimated to run at a loss of $120,000 under its method of case-mix funding. It cannot continue to run at a $120,000 loss. Another hospital will close. But what happens to the town? If a hospital closes, we lose nurses. Nurses are paid wages. The wages are spent in the local community. Again, the town loses wages. Nurses are parents; they have children. So the school loses children. The infrastructure of another rural town gets ripped apart and the town diminishes in size and with that the flow out from regional Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hospitals are important; they employ people. Quite apart from providing necessary medical services for rural people, they are important in terms of income to the town. So teachers will be going; nurses will be going. In the same area five community nurses have been given their tickets and told, `We don't want community nurses'. There will be no more community in Seymour and Broadford. Soft, caring Liberal Party philosophy! Jeffrey Kennett is applying Fightback's policy of cutting $10 billion and the end result is unemployment, a drop in services and the devastation of rural Victoria. That is the policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to talk about cutting income tax, imposing a 15 per cent GST&mdash;and industrial relations. Let us look at the Victorian industrial relations system. What a ripper! It does not work. There is no industrial relations system in Victoria. The legislation of two-bottle Gude&mdash;he is known as two-bottle Gude, as the House probably knows, because he said publicly that he drew up the Victorian government's legislation on industrial relations over a weekend with two bottles of scotch&mdash;is a joke. It does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most state members of parliament of the conservative right wing persuasion&mdash;I hesitate to call them liberals these days&mdash;will tell us quite bluntly, `We've got to do something about it'. We read in the papers that Mr Gude is probably going back up to his mountain retreat. He might take four bottles of scotch this time to help him get the system to work again. Maybe four bottles will produce something better than will two. We might then get some kind of industrial relations system going in Victoria which will at least give both employers and employees some degree of hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been another attack on the family. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 17 February 1994 ran a story with the headline, `200% kinder fee increase'. We have another example of the soft, caring, concerned attitude towards families&mdash;families with children, families on wages. I heard the honourable member for Wakefield say that the coalition supports unlimited wages, yet I am not quite sure whether it was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who once said that there should be a $3 youth wage. I might have missed that somewhere along the line. I accept that we want unlimited wages, yet we find that fees of some Victorian kindergartens have risen by up to 229 per cent. It is worth while reflecting on that. These are the people we hear our conservative opponents say they are concerned about, care about and want to do something for. Those policies are put in place in Victoria and there is a 229 per cent increase in kindergarten fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 3 December carried a report from the OECD in relation to classroom sizes.

But, in reality, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, we now have the highest classroom levels in the OECD. We are the clever country which says, `We understand that we need to produce education results for our children so that when they leave and come into the work force they will be cleverer and better educated'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriation bills are for parliament to approve the expenditure of the government. We would expect from the government a good listing of exactly what is being spent. Today I want to address the absolutely appalling standard of the financial reporting from the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. I refer to the program performance statements for 1993, which came out several days after the actual budget papers, and to the budget papers, which give just the large appropriations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at division 270-3 in budget paper No. 2, we see allocation for the environment program of $37 million for 1993-94. That is an overall number and is obviously not much use to anybody looking at that program to see where the expenditure is being made, what the money is going on and whether the Australian taxpayer is getting value for money. That is why we have the program performance statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year I waited eagerly for the PPSs to come out so that I could see how the department of the environment was spending taxpayers' money&mdash;on what programs and whether these programs were worth while. The department of the environment divides its programs into nine subprograms. I will ignore subprogram 1.1 because it is just a policy program and has expenditure of less than $1 million. Subprogram 1.2 is climate change and environmental liaison. If we turn to that in the program performance statements, we find that there is an allocation for running costs of just over $1 million and for administrative expenses of $190,000. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we really want to know beyond that is where the money actually goes in environment programs. We find an amount of $9,660,000 allotted to the environment program. That tells us a lot. Where does the money go? How much goes to which programs? What programs are included in this allocation? There is no information in this section at all to tell the taxpayers how their $9 1/2 million has been spent except that, quite interestingly, in an environment portfolio it has gone on an environment program. We would not be surprised about that. So much for subprogram 1.2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps subprogram 1.3 on environmental planning is a bit better. Again we find an amount for running costs&mdash;salaries and administration&mdash;and the bulk of the money going to an environment program. There are no details. Of course, there is a reference to division 270-3, back in budget paper No. 2, which, as I pointed out before, is just a global allocation. Under `environmental program' we have absolutely no idea where the expenditure will be, to what programs it will be made or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at subprogram 1.4, conservation. Again, we have salaries, administration and something called, funnily enough, an environment program, which has an allocation of $5 1/2 million. But we look down and find no information at all. What programs come under the environment program? There is no indication. There is no indication of how much goes to what programs, what programs are included in it and how much the allocations are. There is some text which refers generally to strategies without actually mentioning any of these programs' allocations&mdash;whether they get a large or a small portion of that $5 1/2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subprogram 1.5 is natural resources management and again we have an environment program allocation of $3 million. We look at ANCA, which for those who do not know the portfolio is the Australian Nature Conservation Agency, at subprogram 1.9. Here we have quite a large expenditure of $42 million in, would you believe, a program. There are no details about what program and nothing about how that $42 million would actually be expended. There is also no indication as to where we might find the information, not even a reference to the original budget papers&mdash;simply an appropriation for the program of ANCA of $42 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Trying to get these figures to add up and match the actual budget paper becomes quite a mystery tour. If we look at Budget Paper No. 2, we find that the actual figures given there for the environment program do not add up. Budget Paper No. 2 states that ANCA gets $62 million in appropriations. However, the PPS states that it is not $62 million but $67 million. There is no explanation as to why the two are not reconciled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that subprogram there is capital works expenditure. The PPS refers us to section 848-2 of Budget Paper No. 2. The program performance statement gives a fairly clear capital works expenditure of $7,190,000. However, when we actually go to where it should be reconciled with the budget papers, we find that the Australian Nature Conservation Agency allocation for capital expenditure is actually $5 million with, again, no explanation as to why that $5 million does not line up with the $7 million in the PPS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These might seem rather esoteric figures and dry financial statements, but this goes to the heart of parliamentary accountability. If we cannot look at the financial statements given by the government to see how the parliament is approving money to be spent, what is the point of accountability? There is no accountability. I know that the sports program, which is administered by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, has had a lot of questions on its administration. I would suggest that this goes through the whole department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back to this discrepancy between the $7 million and the $5 million for capital expenditure, I have no question that this is a legitimate expenditure, but I question the way it has been reported. I understand from the department that the discrepancy is because certain moneys come in as income for the department and that is then expended, but they are not reflected in the appropriations because that does not come out of appropriations. That is one of the most sloppy pieces of reporting that I have yet to see. No business that I know of could possibly get away with this type of non-accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought I would check with another department and see whether this was common to all departments. Another department in which I have a particular interest is the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. I did not check through all the program performance statements, I just opened the performance statements of this department to see what that department gives. It gives the staffing and the administration. Then we have subprogram 1.2: Crops. On page 37 we have running costs for the Australian Horticultural Corporation of $2 1/2 million. It then says, `Australian Tobacco Marketing Advisory Committee&mdash;Allocation of tobacco charges under the Tobacco Marketing Act'&mdash;a very specific allocation of money for a very specific purpose. Anybody looking at the program performance statements can follow quite clearly where that money was going and why parliament was appropriating it to be spent by that department. Internal organisations contributions amount to $55,900; the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is then listed. They are well set out so that the parliament and the people of Australia know where the money is being expended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In subprogram 1.5, under the heading `Appropriation Bill (No. 2)' there is a payment to the Northern Territory and a payment to New South Wales. Under the heading `Appropriation Bill (No. 1)', it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth defence of common law action arising from atomic test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a specific entry which allows people to see where the money&mdash;$846,000&mdash;is being spent, which is a bit different from the $34,000-odd spent by ANCA or one of the other programs. ANCA might have another book that it puts out, but at the moment I am just referring to what is available in the program performance statements. There are other sections of the environment portfolio that have no other annual report. Allocations are given for the management of former atomic test sites. There are also international organisations contributions and allocations to the Joint Coal Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although that is not a sampling of all books, I did have a look through other program performance statements and it seems that they did give a clear listing of what was spent. It is only when we come to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories that we have this total non-accounting for money. This is not good enough. It is the sloppiest kind of reporting that we could imagine. I cannot imagine a sandwich shop turning in such incredibly poor lists. What would they say: appropriations on food, $500,000, and that is it? Even that would be better than we get in the program performance statements where we find that an amount of $9,660,000 has been allocated for the environment program under subprogram 1.2: Climate change and environmental liaison. What does that tell us is being done and spent on climate change? There are nice things that the department is looking at. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Resources assigned and action commenced to develop a National Greenhouse Gas Inventory.</PARA>
<PARA>But it is not listed there. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Climate change impacts were factored into national strategies on forestry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>How much did that cost? It further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Support was provided for climate change impacts research on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;assessment of vulnerability to sea level rise;</PARA>
<PARA>How much did it get&mdash;$100, $200, $2,000 or $2 million? There is no indication in these books at all. As I said, no business could get away with this. If it did, there would be severe questions by the shareholders, the Taxation Office and everybody else. Yet this government, with appropriations of $60 million-odd&mdash;depending on whether one reads this book or that book; they vary&mdash;can get away with just lumping everything into the environment program. If honourable members look it up and add it all up, they will be able to get an allocation for salaries and administration. Then there is an enormous lump sum. The summary table lists the programs from one to nine. What sort of accountability is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to address her department as a matter of urgency before the May 1994-95 budget so that we can see how that department spends its money. It should not go in for this totally inadequate, totally sloppy administration of its funds. We should introduce some accountability into the portfolio. If accountability becomes a part of the Department for the Environment, Sport and Territories, perhaps we will not have such sloppy accounting procedures in future and we might avoid such obvious disasters as the sports rorts affair. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the appropriation bills before the chamber. They deal with a range of financial appropriations for the purposes of the budget. In speaking to the House today on these appropriation bills it is opportune to have a look at the general state of the economy and where our budget and other strategies have placed the nation. There can be no doubt that the Australian economy is now in a position which is the best it has been in for some 30 years. The economic performance in the nation has been widely acclaimed by commentators within Australia and abroad. At the outset, I would like to mention some of the independent assessments that have recently been made. The Westpac Bank's most recent publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Market Insights</EMPHASIS>, deals with assessments of the Australian economy and other key trading partners. In its January-February document, when commenting on Australia, it said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy enters 1994 in its best shape in years. The business cycle has turned up. Exports continue to do well. Sustainable growth is expected over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inflationary pressures will remain low and interest rates will not rise until 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was particularly bemused at that last comment because I recall the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) a few days ago asking what was the silliest question any of us can recall being asked in this place, seeking an undertaking about interest rates and what level they might be at for the rest of the year. Having acknowledged the stupidity of that question, though, I thought it interesting that the Westpac publication, which was produced only a few weeks ago, made its assessment stating that it believed interest rates would remain low and not rise before 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Westpac publication also includes some estimates of how it sees the economy going into the future. Its latest assessment of the growth of the Australian economy estimates that real GDP is now growing at 3.4 per cent in Australia. That is a level which is not matched by any other OECD country. Every nation in Europe would love to have a figure like that and would love to have economic growth travelling along at nearly 3 1/2 per cent; most of them would love to have it travelling at three per cent. The fact of life is that we are one of the few countries in the world and the only country in the OECD currently recording economic growth at those levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other countries in the OECD table which are performing comparatively well&mdash;New Zealand and the United States&mdash;still have a growth rate well below that of Australia. On latest figures, Westpac's estimate for New Zealand's rate of real GDP growth is 2.9 per cent and for the United States it is 2.8 per cent. Our major trading partner, Japan, is estimated to have a growth rate of 0.5 per cent. In that lies one of the difficulties we have in maintaining our exports to Japan, which is presently going through a period of severe economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look further into the future, we see that the Westpac assessments for 1994 and 1995 provide an even more glowing endorsement of this government's economic strategies. Its forecast for 1994 is an economic growth rate in Australia of 3.5 per cent. That figure has been revised up by the Westpac bank. In 1994 New Zealand's rate of growth is expected to be three per cent and for the United States it is expected to be 3.2 per cent. The story gets better; Westpac's assessment for 1995 is that not only will the Australian economy continue to grow but it should increase its growth to record a four per cent growth rate in 1995. New Zealand's rate of growth is expected to decline to 2.7 per cent, with the United States growth rate remaining steady at 3.2 per cent. Pleasingly, Westpac estimates that the Japanese economy will experience significant growth in 1995, recording a growth rate of about two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very clear picture we get from that is that Westpac's assessment of the Australian economy is not just that we are doing well but that we are doing better than any other comparable economy. As Westpac commented in its summary:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recovery is firmly established in the US, Australia and New Zealand. But Europe and Japan will endure another tough year in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Business and consumer confidence in Australia has improved markedly and the leading economic indicators are also clearly positive.</PARA>
<PARA>Specifically in relation to Australia, Westpac said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy finished 1993 on a high note: solid employment gains have discarded the "jobless recovery" tag, while retailers enjoyed good Christmas sales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Better economic data has quashed any chance of lower short term interest rates in 1994 and has supported a recovery of the AUD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian dollar&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">from its 1993 lows. The GATT agreement is good news for exporters.</PARA>
<PARA>The Westpac assessment is unequivocally supportive of the outcomes that this government and its economic strategies&mdash;primarily through the budget but also through other instruments of government policy&mdash;have been able to deliver for the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Westpac assessment that has come out in the last few weeks that we can be proud of. The Business Council of Australia is not an organisation which often commends the government for its economic and industrial strategies. However, when the Business Council conducts its surveys, even it has to live with the outcome. Members of the opposition often quote the Business Council of Australia in this place. But they have been particularly silent about the Business Council's most recent survey of its members' views of how the economy is travelling. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of December last year reported on the council's seventh survey of business conditions. The overview of results was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the six months to 31 March 1994, respondents expect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.growth in sales volumes and values;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.growth in exports, but stronger growth in imports;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.growth in capital expenditure, at a faster rate than in the April 1993 survey;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.an improved outlook for employment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.low inflation.</PARA>
<PARA>That demonstrates the confidence amongst the members of the Business Council of Australia in the underlying strength of our economy. The Business Council then divided up the responses, looking at the manufacturing sector and the non-manufacturing sector. In relation to the manufacturing sector, the Business Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outlook for the total sales volume of manufacturers is for a continuation of positive growth . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the non-manufacturing sector it commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outlook . . . remains positive. Ten out of 11 respondents expect growth in real terms in the coming six months.</PARA>
<PARA>The Business Council went on to make the observation that the expectations in its previous survey in April 1993 were actually surpassed by the performance in the economy. Mr Ian Salmon, the chairman of the economic and financial panel of the Business Council said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Results of the . . . Survey . . . show a strengthening of the economic recovery. Sales volumes are expected, on average, to grow by 7% per annum in the half-year to 31 March 1994 . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is an amazingly good performance. Importantly, the number of survey respondents expecting to increase investment expenditure jumped from 55 per cent to 72 per cent. So 72 per cent of the membership of the Business Council of Australia say that they intend to increase their investment in the six months ahead. The Business Council, Westpac and a range of other commentators say that economic growth is not only doing well but doing better than it was last year and it is doing better than growth is in any comparable country. All these matters are in the public domain. Indeed, the Business Council of Australia is in regular contact with members of the opposition, particularly the opposition frontbench. But we have not heard a peep out of them on any of these matters because it does not suit their current purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the most recent National Australia Bank quarterly business survey reinforces the position of both Westpac and the BCA surveys. The report of the NAB survey for the December quarter for 1993 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As foreshadowed by the previous survey, results of the latest . . . Business Survey indicate that . . . conditions improved markedly during the December quarter 1993. Indeed, employment growth exceeded expectations for the December quarter and there was a sizeable increase in capacity utilisation.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a particularly important issue. There is no issue more significant to me, to my electorate of Brisbane, or to the government than the increase in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a source of great pleasure and pride to members on this side of the House that earlier this year the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was able to announce in the parliament a revision of Treasury estimates of our economic growth. Less than a year ago, we estimated our economy would be growing at a rate of about 2 3/4 per cent. As I just mentioned, we know that it is growing faster than that, and Treasury has revised the estimate up to 3 1/2 per cent. But, very pleasingly, we have also seen an increase in job growth beyond the forecast contained in last year's August budget. In this financial year an additional 100,000 new jobs will be created over and above the budget estimate. The budget estimated the creation of an additional 100,000 jobs. That figure has been doubled. That is a very substantial outcome and is directly attributable to the increased economic activity and the growth which the government has been able to engender through its industry policy, through its budget strategy and through its industrial relations policies. The</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the December quarter firms in all states reported an increase in employment except Tasmania where it remained unchanged. The largest increases were recorded in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to record in this House that a Queensland state Labor government has not only very properly and effectively administered an economy for the benefit of the business community but also ensured that the proceeds from the wealth that is created in Queensland are more equitably distributed. As a member from that state with a Labor government, I am delighted to be able to record that sort of performance for Queensland, which is leading the nation in employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other areas that are important in this mix of policies that has seen Australia's economic growth reach the top of the ladder. It is no accident that in the United States the Bill Clinton administration is now looking at Australia to study our industrial relations system; nor is it any accident that last year representatives from the United States administration were seeking advice from Australia about our health care system and about Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues of industrial relations and health care were central in the election 12 months ago. The policies that those opposite put to the people of Australia in the areas of industrial relations and health, which were so resoundingly rejected&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;have now been discarded by governments in most parts of the world. It is only the hard-nosed right-wing ideologues scattered around some parts of Europe&mdash;but appearing in a bit more abundance in this place&mdash;who want to stick to that hard ideological position on industrial relations and health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States Clinton administration now looks at us as one of the two or three nations in the world from which it believes it can learn some things in those important policy areas. This is against a background of the Australian taxpayer now paying the lowest percentage of income of any citizen in any nation in the OECD. The OECD's figures released at the end of last year show that, in Australia, as a percentage of GDP, all government taxation combined is now the lowest of any nation in the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this economic performance and the social equity that has come through industrial relations, Medicare and other activities have been achieved through efficiencies and restructuring. They have also allowed us to achieve a position in which we are now the lowest taxed nation in the OECD. What have we seen on the opposition benches while all this has been occurring?  There has been a fair bit of disarray on the opposition benches for the last 12 months, but that has certainly been heightened in recent weeks. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that long ago that there were only two people in the revolving door. Obviously it has been redesigned, because now there is a list as long as my arm. It is not just the old Howard and Hewson and Peacock show any more. Indeed, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is touted as a potential leader. We also have Senator Bishop, whom we expect to have in this place&mdash;if there is room on that ever-expanding front bench to physically locate another human being. There is also the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). The list goes on. Watching <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> these days becomes an entertaining exercise as we see opposition backbenchers trot out their latest theory on who should lead them. Not too many tell us that the current Leader of the Opposition should continue to lead them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst the government has been about establishing an economic record which is the envy of the OECD world, the opposition has been very deeply involved in internal navel contemplation. If there was any doubt about the prospects for the Leader of the Opposition's longevity in that job, I think the preselections in Warringah put paid to it. I think the person who missed out most when Mr Abbott was selected for the Liberal Party was not the person he defeated but the current Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the response of the Leader of the Opposition and his team to all this? The first thing they did was to try to enlarge the front bench. This is the growth industry of the opposition in this place. Those opposite have enlarged the front bench to the point where there is literally no more room to sit anybody. I think the observations of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), a National Party member, on that issue are as useful as any. The honourable member for Cowper wrote to his leader about the problem of having 37 chiefs and not many Indians left. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a Shadow Ministry of 37 . . . verges on the absurd and taints us as well as the Liberals.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that, as one of the few Indians left in the opposition, he felt that the Nationals were under-represented in the shadow cabinet. It may well be the growth industry, and it may well be a tactic to try to extend the life of the Leader of the Opposition in his current position, but it ignores the main game. So too does the other tactic of those opposite. Apart from worrying about their backs, their other tactic in last few months has been to turn attention to the bit shows, the sideshows, rather than to the main game. Sports grants and the minutiae of them are not big national issues. They are not part of the big picture. They are not about job creation. They are not about equity in the distribution of wealth. They are not about ensuring the rights of people. They are a useful diversion for the political leadership in the opposition, which is severely embattled at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention a couple of very specific issues in relation to the operation of government industry and budgetary policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the tourism industry is still outside the mainstream umbrella of the EMDG scheme.

Tourism, of course, is now the largest single export earner for our nation. It is a key industry&mdash;not just for states such as Queensland but for the nation as a whole&mdash;and we should be doing all we can to support it. The government deserves to be commended for its economic management. There is no doubt that the economy is now in strong growth and in the best circumstances that it has been for many decades. The Treasurer and his predecessors in the Hawke-Keating governments can be well proud of their efforts. </PARA>

I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa that there needs to be a system of high-speed spoke roads coming out from our cities; I do not deny that for a moment. But his government has not increased the amount of money provided for that purpose. In fact, it has cut it clean in half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great exponents of economic rationalism talk about competition. When speaking recently in this place on the subject, people interjected, `Let's have the days of John McEwen back again, haw, haw, haw'. They made a number of disparaging comments about John McEwen and his policies. It is unfortunate for them that people write history books and Australian year books. Such people list the figures that will indicate to future generations how successful a policy has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the so-called bad old days of John McEwen. When John McEwen left this House, unemployment in this nation for the last half of 1971 was 1.6 per cent. It is now 10.7 per cent. Bankruptcies were running at 2,428 in 1971. This last year ended, they ran at 14,718. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always say the words `current account deficit' as though they formed a single term. In 1971, there was a current account surplus of $691 million. This year, there is a current account deficit of $15,473 million. The budget in 1971 was a meagre and minuscule $8,000 million. The budget now is $115,000 million. It was a balanced budget then; it is now an unbalanced budget to the tune of $15,000 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, $US1.40 would buy $A1, and Y376 was needed to purchase $A1. Only Y70 is now needed to purchase $A1, and only US70c is needed to purchase $A1. That provides some idea of the relativities and how Australia has fallen so dramatically behind the other countries of the world. Finally, in those days, we were the third richest nation on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the judgment upon the McEwen era. There was 1.6 per cent unemployment then versus 10.7 per cent now. Bankruptcies then were approximately 2,500; now they are approximately 15,000. In those days, there was a balance of payments surplus, while now there is a balance of payments deficit of $15,000 million per year. There were then budget outlays of a meagre $8,000 million per year, while now they are $115,000 million per year. At that time, $US1.40 was needed to buy $1. It is now half that figure. The change has been far more dramatic in terms of the yen: the amount of money needed to buy $1 has dropped from Y376 to Y70. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say with great pride that I am a very strong supporter of the McEwen era. McEwen had the right approach in what he attempted to do. History proves conclusively that he was absolutely correct.

These men have been responsible for creaming and thieving $22,000 million from the Australian public. Please excuse me for not taking much notice of these people&mdash;they have been on the front pages of all the media throughout Australia and on television&mdash;who constantly told us how wonderful things were in the early 1980s.

There is not a great necessity to claim technical bankruptcy; very few people walk down that pathway. For every person who becomes bankrupt, at least 10 would have gone completely and utterly broke. Seven hundred thousand broke may be over three million Australians in families that have gone broke. </PARA>

Many of these people are honourable and hard working. It is part of the principles by which they live that they will pay back that money. So for the rest of their days they will live in an environment where it will be very difficult to find enough money to feed themselves and their kids. That is literally happening. </PARA>

It is rather interesting that Gough Whitlam doubled average weekly earnings throughout Australia; he doubled the wage structure. Everyone said, `Isn't he a wonderful man?'. During the same time, he also doubled the consumer price index. In fact, at the end of that three-year, arguably four-year, period people ended up in exactly the same position as when they started. There had been no growth in real incomes. Interestingly, in the four or five years prior to that there had been nearly a 30 per cent growth in real incomes. The CPI was restrained and average weekly earnings went up very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most fascinating phenomenon is that, for all those who vote for the Labor Party and enjoy average weekly earnings&mdash;wages or incomes, if you like&mdash;in Australia, under the government that is in office now, the CPI has risen 62.9 per cent and average weekly earnings have risen 49.4 per cent. So the average Australian is 13.5 per cent worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take into account the dramatic drop in the Australian dollar, from 95c to 70c as against the yen, the average Australian's purchasing power is eroded by another six per cent. Taxation has more than doubled under this government over a period of eight or nine years. It has risen from $41,000 million to $96,000 million and most of it has been through indirect taxation increases. Those increases take another 11 per cent off the average weekly earnings of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great argument that members of the government used against us before the last election, in an exercise in arch hypocrisy, was that the GST was going to make the average Australian poorer, and yet they are the people that instituted and dramatically increased indirect taxation on every single Australian. In fact, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;and I am flying by memory here&mdash;the government has almost doubled indirect taxation in Australia in its period in office. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you I am not flying by memory on all my other figures; they are all very tightly nailed down. As I have said, that carves another 11 per cent off the average weekly earnings of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we add those three components together&mdash;the dramatic increase in taxation, the loss in the value of the Australian dollar, and the average weekly earnings versus CPI figure&mdash;we have a loss of income of over 30 per cent. People want to know why they cannot afford to buy a new car. People want to know why they cannot afford to keep up their house repayments. The reason is that their real incomes have dropped dramatically, by over 30 per cent&mdash;30.5 per cent, to be specific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Brisbane told us about the great new world&mdash;the socialist paradise&mdash;that we are moving into. The remarks of the St Vincent de Paul Society and the Brotherhood of St Laurence are most pertinent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that we are walking into a great future. Let me just bring some realities into this House. We are opening up the Australian economy to totally free trade. We heard all that from the new honourable member for Werriwa. That means that anyone who produces goods outside Australia can bring those goods into Australia. If we are not internationally competitive then, of course, we will see our industries vanish&mdash;and at the present moment they are vanishing at a great rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be specific, the only industries in which Australia can compete are the agricultural industries and the mining industries. Outside of those two industries there will not be a job in producing anything in Australia because we are not cost competitive. I say that with such vehemence and passion because last year, out of $61,000 million worth of commodities exported from Australia, only $4 1/2 thousand million worth came from the manufacturing sector, and probably a third of that was as a result of the round robin subsidy on motor vehicles which will not exist over the next two years. So the real figure is about $3,000 million. As the Australian economy is opened up to competition, through GATT, the internationalists and the globalists&mdash;the international commodities brokers, if you like&mdash;having their way, that competition will come in and will cut down every single industry in Australia, every single producer in Australia with the exception of those in the agricultural and mining sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me no joy to tell this House that the agricultural sector is in desperate trouble. Our major input item, if you like, is interest rates. Our interest rates are 50 per cent higher than those in the United States; they are 9.5 per cent in Australia and 6.5 per cent in the United States, who is our biggest competitor in the field of agriculture. Our fuel price is 42c a litre even with the tax taken off, but it is 25c in the United States. Fertilisers&mdash;urea, or nitrogenous fertilisers, being the most important&mdash;cost $203 per tonne in the United States and $396 in Australia. Water charges are $3.90 a megalitre in California and $30 in Queensland. The honourable member for Brisbane praised the Queensland government, but that is how competitive the Queensland government has made Queensland, with water charges at $30 a megalitre. We pay $10 an hour for labour. I am not critical of my nation; I am proud that we pay the highest labour costs anywhere in the world. In the United States, California specifically, the labour cost is $4 an hour&mdash;and it is the biggest agricultural producing state in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can we be competitive in the field of agriculture? We are not competitive because our farmers are working below the cost of production. A recent survey shows that 74 per cent of the graziers in western Queensland were not paying their way; they were drawing on savings or they were getting money from jobs in the town et cetera. So those farmers are subsidising their product. They personally are working at a loss. They are non-competitive now, and it is only a matter of time before the door is closed and production ceases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What future is there for agriculture in Australia when we are nearly 100 per cent more expensive in fuel, nearly 100 per cent more expensive in fertiliser, 50 per cent more expensive in interest rates, nearly 1,000 per cent higher in water charges and 100 per cent higher in labour costs. Interest rates are set by the federal government, water charges are set by the state government, labour charges are set by the government as well. The government is responsible for all of those things.

Honourable members will be aware of reports that appeared in last week's media concerning allegations of a second massacre in East Timor, one which immediately followed the much publicised initial bloodshed on November 12, 1991. The allegations appeared in most of the major press and are attributed to Max Stahl, a British photojournalist who was responsible for footage of the Santa Cruz cemetery massacre. This footage was smuggled out of East Timor and caused both national and international distress at the time of its release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This original footage, shown on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program in February 1992, presented us with the horrible images of Indonesian armed forces firing unprovoked and indiscriminately into a crowd of unarmed East Timorese. The footage also displayed the soldiers beating members of the crowd after the firing had ceased, and a man who was stabbed five times and died shortly afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all remember what happened on that day in 1991. We may also remember that, initially, the Indonesian military put the death toll at 19 people. Later, the government increased the figure to 50 people killed in the graveyard at Santa Cruz&mdash;that is, 50 people that the Indonesian government is prepared to admit to in this incident alone. Of course, as honourable members are aware, this figure is not accepted by most international agencies and certainly is not accepted by the East Timorese. It is clear to all that the number murdered that day is much higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the United Nations Commission on Human Rights voted to condemn Indonesia as that country had never satisfactorily explained what happened to 207 demonstrators missing since November 12, 1991. The Indonesian military carried out what it described as an extensive investigation into 66 people reported missing since the day of the massacre. It found two. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Monday of this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There's still obviously some uncertainties about what actually happened and how many people are still missing and how many of those are dead.</PARA>
<PARA>The allegations of a second massacre are not new. Not unexpectedly, their denial is not new, either. Firstly, though, I would like to look at the allegations that have been raised in the new film and demonstrate that they are in fact consistent with many other reports which came from Dili directly after the massacre. Late last year Mr Stahl sneaked back into East Timor and filmed interviews with eyewitnesses to the second massacre. The interviews form part of a documentary which was presented on British television yesterday and which I hope will soon be shown on Australian television. It is my intention to try to gain a copy of this film and show it here in the federal parliament as soon as I can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two eyewitnesses in that documentary claim that, following the carnage at the cemetery, scores of bodies were piled into trucks and taken to a nearby military hospital. One of the eyewitnesses reportedly survived the firing by hiding behind a tree. However, after the shooting the soldiers advanced, telling survivors to stand up, upon which they were stabbed. The East Timorese eyewitness was discovered by the armed forces and they beat him with rifle butts until they thought he was dead. Taken to the military hospital, the man, pretending to be dead, saw other survivors stabbed, or fed with poison. Others he said, `were badly wounded and lay there screaming; he'&mdash;the Indonesian soldier&mdash;`threw a rock on their heads, just once, and, if they survived, he threw it again at their chest. It made a loud noise. It sounded like coconuts as they fall from a tree to the ground'. He believed that in total 10 trucks carrying bodies were taken to the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another eyewitness was a laboratory assistant on duty at the military hospital when the trucks arrived. He said that there were Indonesian soldiers surrounding the hospital when the trucks started to arrive so that no-one could get in or out. He said that the wounded were just thrown on the ground and some of them were run over by the trucks in which they arrived. He says in the documentary that the troops asked him if the hospital had any poison which would kill people quickly. He did not, so they were given some tablets that would kill people slowly. These were used on many of the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have to wait until the documentary is broadcast in this country before we know the full extent of the allegations, but there can be no doubt that they will be gruesome and that we will be appalled and that we will express our unmitigated outrage, as we always do. But the question is: will we do anything? The Indonesian government was very quick to deny the second round of allegations. It has done this, as far as I know, without raising a finger to at least check their validity. I very much doubt&mdash;unless pressure is brought to bear&mdash;whether it ever will. </PARA>

Why it has not chosen not to investigate them, knowing about them for all this time, will remain a matter for speculation and incrimination. In fact, the allegations raised in the documentary are totally consistent with reports which emerged from Timor immediately following the massacre. Stephen Cox, a British photographer, was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territorian</EMPHASIS> newspaper five days after the November massacre as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dead and wounded had been unceremoniously loaded onto trucks by the Indonesians, most of them Javanese, and driven away.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cox said he saw about 50 corpses but had no doubts that others were killed elsewhere. Six days after the massacre, a second Australian diplomat was sent to Dili to investigate accusations of a second massacre. According to accounts, army trucks loaded with as many as 70 people left Dili and headed west. The witness, who called for an international investigation said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people were naked, blindfolded, with their hands tied behind their backs, and were driven away by members of Indonesian battalions 700 and 744.</PARA>
<PARA>Two months after the killings, several witnesses were quoted in the Indonesian press telling of violence they had seen in the wake of the shootings. One parliamentarian was quoted as saying that he saw troop members stab wounded people after the shootings. Immediately after the November 12 killings I was personally contacted by three East Timorese families here in Australia, who told me how some of their family members were rounded up by Indonesian troops on the night of the massacre and taken away. These people, by all accounts, have never been seen nor heard from since. When I was contacted I without delay contacted officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, asking them to investigate these claims and ascertain the whereabouts of the people concerned. To this day I have not heard what happened to most of these people. The Indonesian government has never investigated these allegations and, if its track record is anything to go by, it never will. Basic human rights will continue to be abused in East Timor if things are left to the Indonesian government and the Indonesian military. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian government did run its own inquiry into the allegations surrounding the Santa Cruz massacre. It was of course not the first massacre perpetrated against the East Timorese&mdash;murder, torture and political incarceration are no strangers in East Timor. This particular massacre is simply a continuation of the Indonesian military's oppression in East Timor since they landed there in 1975. Initially the military confirmed that 19 people had died in the graveyard at Santa Cruz. The government's commission of inquiry later revised this figure to 50 and, as I said earlier, has admitted that many people are still missing. But where are these missing people? Some have undoubtedly fled the country. Others probably went into hiding, such as the two whom the Indonesian military were able to find. Most others are obviously dead and may never receive the justice to which they are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, however, in regard to these allegations that the Indonesian commission found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The handling of the dead bodies of the victims . . . was not carefully managed and identified accordingly. The opportunity to identify the victims was not given to their relatives or friends.</PARA>
<PARA>Since then, the Indonesian government has been very stringent with whom it allows into East Timor and under what conditions they may enter. Until recently, Indonesian journalists themselves were disallowed from entering for a period of six months. The International Red Cross has had tremendous difficulty in gaining access to prisoners in East Timorese gaols. While free enterprise marches on in Indonesia, freedom, it seems, does not enjoy the same prominence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to Australia's position on human rights, particularly in East Timor. The standard outcries at the time of the Dili massacre were expressed and were properly taken up with the Indonesian government. This parliament passed a comprehensive motion, which those opposite tried to water down, that called on the Australian government to do a number of things. We expressed our sympathy, our condemnation and our repugnance. We noted that the Indonesian government planned a commission of investigation and hoped that it would be conducted properly. Subsequently we expressed concern that it was not done in a fair and just manner. We sent our diplomats, our foreign minister and our Prime Minister to ask the appropriate questions. But still the answer as to what happened on that November day remains ambiguous at best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to bring justice to the East Timorese people using diplomatic channels and we have failed. Perhaps the best testimony to this failure and the best indication of blatant abuse is the trials which followed the events of November 12. The results of the trials were that only 10 soldiers responsible for the killing of at least 50 people and probably over 150 were given 18-month gaol sentences, which in most cases were suspended. At the same time, the unarmed protesters were handed out sentences ranging from five years to life. This is justice Indonesian style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further example of the failure of justice and lack of respect for basic human rights in Indonesia was provided in the mockery of a trial given to Timorese resistance leader Xanana Gusmao. Gusmao was denied fair representation, and was prevented from making his own statement to the court in his defence. I would like to remind members of some of Xanana's comments which he was denied the opportunity to deliver in the court. He pleads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of East Timor is the responsibility of the international community, a question of international law. It is a case in which universal principles are at stake, a case where the decolonisation norms of the U.N. have been manipulated, a case where Indonesia has disregarded the resolutions of the U.N., a case therefore of the flagrant violation of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the universal pattern of law, peace and justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to all friends of East Timor, parliamentarians from Europe, America, Japan and Australia, to go on pressing their own governments to change the double standards applied to similar cases where systematic violations of U.N. resolutions occur, as in the case of Indonesia's behaviour regarding East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Secretary General of the U.N. to ensure that the solution he seeks for East Timor is based on universal principles and international law.</PARA>
<PARA>The East Timorese people, not 300 kilometres from Australia, are being persecuted by the Indonesians while we talk about the diversity of our relationship and getting on with business. When will the rights of humanity be given the same importance as the rights of trade? Is free enterprise not founded on freedom or will economic accessibility continue to take precedence in Australia's consideration of Indonesia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has expressed limited support for further United Nations examination, not only of the matter of the Dili massacre, but also in respect of the entire human rights situation in East Timor. My plea is for this to be taken much further. There have been a number of visits of United Nations envoys to Indonesia to look at the situation there. All have come out with a list of concerns and recommendations that they believe the Indonesian government should implement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The special rapporteur on the question of torture expressed considerable concerns and the special rapporteur on judicial summary or arbitrary executions expressed similar views. The working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances also expressed very serious concerns, but still the killing goes on. All these expressions of concern led the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to release a resolution which again called on the Indonesian government to end human rights abuses in East Timor and to open the island up to greater international scrutiny. The Indonesian government worked tirelessly to try to ensure that this resolution was not adopted. It seems a pity that it is not as interested in working tirelessly to protect the rights of the East Timorese people with the same level of effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian government, like Australia, is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is clearly not fulfilling its obligations. Last year the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade released its manual on human rights. Page 2 of the manual looks at the interface between economic interests and human rights. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government . . . does not consider that economic rights should be accorded priority over civil and political freedom. A society which respects and promotes individual rights, with the physical and intellectual freedom they involve, is more likely than not to be in a position to enjoy economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>This was also raised last year by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, of which I am a member, in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's relations with Indonesia</EMPHASIS>. On the matter of East Timor, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could be argued that Australia should do more, such as making East Timor an issue at the UN.</PARA>
<PARA>Other key recommendations of the committee are to reopen Australia's consulate in Dili and the re-establishment of a direct Darwin-Dili air service. This would demonstrate to the rest of the world that the East Timorese people are treated in the same way as the rest of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise these issues for it is clearly time that Australia took a new approach to human rights with our nearest neighbour. It is all well and good for us to pursue their money and their trade, but surely such contact must also bring responsibility. Surely we must ensure that the people and governments with whom we trade allow their populations to enjoy the spoils of increased economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly important now that we have heard the announcement of the discovery of oil in the zone of cooperation in the Timor Sea. We need to ensure that the East Timorese, who, along with Australia are the legitimate part-owners of this valuable resource, are able to share in the benefits that this discovery will bring. While there is no doubt that increased trade and investment with Indonesia will bring increased prosperity for both of our nations, one of the benefits of increased wealth, as the human rights manual of the department indicates, should be increased freedom. By this I am not referring to the prospect of independence, to which many people in East Timor still aspire, but simply the freedom to live without fear; fear from the constant threat of torture and freedom to live without the horrible threat of death which exists every day in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what is to be done? Clearly, it is time for the United Nations to become involved in a much more comprehensive manner, not just by sending special envoys when the situation becomes unbearable, but by being involved at a variety of levels and in a constructive manner. Indonesia can assist by opening itself up to a full, independent, international commission of inquiry by the United Nations, not just into the massacre but also into the entire human rights situation on that island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian government should ensure that witnesses who choose to appear before an inquiry are given absolute and unconditional protection. Indonesia has nothing to fear from such a proposal and everything to gain. Only when it faces up to its international obligations to which it has committed itself can that country expect to gain the respect of the international community. Until that time, Indonesia will continue to be treated with suspicion and contempt for its flagrant abuses of human rights, like the ones that were committed on 12 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government should use its good relationship with Indonesia to convince the Indonesian government that the conduct of such an inquiry, and the implementation of whatever recommendations may flow from it, will enable Indonesia and East Timor to move forward with some hope for peace and reconciliation. This is in everyone's interests, including Australia's. I sincerely hope that both governments have the maturity and the commitment to the spirit, principles and conventions of the United Nations to follow this course of action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The appropriation bills cover nearly every aspect of defence funding. Before turning to the bills, I want to make some very relevant general points about policy. The Liberal and National parties have a strong and proud record in defence issues going back a very long time. For example, the Labor Prime Minister Chifley is often praised for the work that he did as Australia's wartime leader. Of course, he did a good job in the time that he was leader but it is also true that the Australian defence effort during World War II was largely underpinned by the organisation put in place by Liberal leader Robert Menzies in his first term as Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be remembered that, in the period after the war during the 1950s and 1960s, many members of the Australian Labor Party were isolationist and many of their fellow travellers were constantly campaigning to undermine Australia's strategic alliances which have been so important in maintaining Australia's national security. Without revisiting the Vietnam War and whilst recognising that it is fair enough to criticise government policy, Australia's defence personnel copped pretty rough treatment from Labor and from the unions in the late 1960s. It is true and it should not be forgotten that members of Australia's defence forces, some soldiers, were advised that they ought not to wear their uniforms when they left their bases for fear of the public reaction to the military at that time. The coalition parties were the backbone of the successful resistance to these campaigns of an isolationist nature during those years, much of it emanating from the Labor Party and its industrial supporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the late 1970s and even in the early 1980s the socialist left in the Labor Party was able to significantly influence Labor Party policy so that attacks on ANZUS were commonplace within Labor ranks. This anti-American and anti-Western alliance trend in the Labor Party saw influential figures in the Labor Party attack Australia's contribution in the Sinai and reject the Fraser government's policy of allowing both United States and United Kingdom ships to enter Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background of antipathy to Australia's role as an active member of the western alliance, the Fraser government in the 1983 election was able to campaign on its good record, which included a $6 billion defence re-equipment program, including 75 new FA18 fighters; new frigates; a commitment to and an established program for new airfields and naval bases; a good record of close cooperation with our ANZUS partners and other allies; increased surveillance of the Indian Ocean; additional support for Australian defence industries, including increases in exports of munitions; support for the Australian aircraft industry, including restructuring of the industry; the implementation of the offsets program; and many other important initiatives. Some of these decisions paved the way for the reorientation of equipment and personnel in the north and furthered the establishment of the two-ocean navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the end of this parliamentary term, Labor will have been in office for 13 years and for 16 of the last 23 years. Many people either have not experienced or have forgotten the political situation facing the last coalition government. It makes an interesting contrast to the experience of the Keating government and the Hawke government before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On many of the major policy issues faced by Messrs Hawke and Keating, Labor has had the policy support of the coalition. Often our policy differences have been that the government has not gone far enough, not that it has introduced the wrong reforms. For example, with the deregulation of the financial markets, we have said that Labor has not gone far enough and that it should have also moved to deregulate the labour markets. We have supported financial deregulation, but we have called on the government for complementary measures such as the better supervision of the banking system, which may have provided a means by which the problems of the state banks of Victoria and South Australia could have been mitigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar theme is discernible in the defence area. In the defence area, Labor has done many of the things which were commenced by the previous coalition government. It is not surprising that we have publicly endorsed the intention of some of those policy positions of this government. But when we were in government and Labor was in opposition, Labor was actively opposed to many of the policy positions of the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in defence and foreign policy, many elements of the Labor Party were totally opposed to the broad thrust of the coalition government's policy. Labor was basically anti-US, anti-ANZUS, and anti-Western alliance. This is not to say that this was the view expressed by the leadership of the party at all times, but it was always a factor in policy deliberations within the ALP. Against this background, bearing in mind the many initiatives of the previous coalition government, the coalition has a proud record in defence issues. When we are back in government, we will give defence the high priority that it should have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, as I have held the position of shadow minister for defence for only a few weeks, there are many issues on which I intend to focus as the opportunities present themselves in the time ahead. However, I want to start today by recognising the high quality and professionalism of the personnel of the Australian defence forces. Australia is well served by the men and women in both the Public Service and the military. They have dedicated their working lives to Australia's national security interests. Australia is fortunate to have people of the very highest calibre and motivation who are prepared to give their talents and energies in the public interest. These Australians follow in the footsteps of their predecessors, who have established an international reputation and recognition which compares favourably with other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time does not allow me to comment further on some of these personnel issues, but I want to say that we are concerned about ensuring appropriate conditions of service for all members of the armed forces. This issue is current and live and will continue to attract the strong attention of the coalition parties. We were strong in our opposition to the government's budgetary measures which were pushed through the parliament at the end of last year and which so significantly reduced the pay and conditions of those particularly at the lower end of the pay scale within the Australian defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the coalition's policy stands as printed, policies may be reviewed. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has established a review process. At this early stage, I am not flagging any areas for review, although obviously, as circumstances change, I will be very carefully monitoring policy. This is especially the case in 1994, as the government has just released its 1993 strategic planning review and, probably during the second half of 1994 or early in 1995, we will introduce a defence white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one policy area which is likely to be reviewed is the existing policy to cut defence expenditure by $200 million. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Strong Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was the excellent policy prepared by one of my predecessors, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the intention was to cut $500 million from existing programs and to introduce initiatives worth an additional $300 million, leaving a net cut of $200 million. The government described this as vandalism during the 1993 election, but after the election it proceeded to introduce its own cuts of a similar dimension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does spend a lot on defence. Looking at our region, using 1991 figures converted to US dollars at 1988 prices, we see that we spend more on defence than the combined budgets of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. On those converted figures, Australia's expenditure is $US6,158 million compared with $US5,783 million. A lot of people are involved, although Labor is cutting back the numbers. There are about 60,000 full-time regular members of the Australian Defence Force and 21,000 full-time civilians. In other words, about 80,000-plus people are involved full time with Australia's defence effort. In addition, there are about 26,000 army reservists, about 8,000 in the other two services and many other Australians involved indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defence forces represent the second biggest employer after Coles-Myer in Australia. Excluding transfer payments for the Commonwealth government, defence is its biggest expenditure item. Defence spending per head in 1992-93 was $561.84. So with an average family size of about four people&mdash;it is a bit less on average&mdash;we spend about $2,000 per family per year for Australia's defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commonly used measure of defence expenditure is to equate it as a measure of gross domestic product. During the Fraser years, defence expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, was 2.4, 2.4, 2.3, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6 per cent. In 1983-84 it started at 2.6 per cent for the first four years and since then, under this Labor administration, it has been 2.3, 2.1, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 per cent. The estimated figure for the 1993-94 year is 2.3 per cent. If the figure remains down at 2.3 per cent or less, then it will mean that during the Hawke-Keating years defence expenditure, as a percentage of GDP, never rose above that spent during the Fraser years. Furthermore, except for the first four years of the 13-year period of the Hawke and Keating governments, defence expenditure will have been as low as or lower than defence expenditure in any of the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was quite right to argue, in the period leading up to the March 1993 election, that there are savings to be had from efficiency measures in the defence vote and that that will continue to be the case for many years to come. The real issue is whether or not any savings so achieved should be directed elsewhere out of defence. Given the expenditure cuts already introduced by Labor and the declining trend in defence expenditure, obviously that existing policy commitment is properly the subject of a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we made the commitment to defence expenditure restraint in Fightback prior to settling on our defence policy. Defence policy should flow from an assessment of Australia's strategic circumstances. Our approach to whether we should review our current policy on funding will be affected by a number of factors which themselves have been changing since the commitment to the cuts was announced in Fightback in November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant elements of our strategic assessment contained in our defence policy in 1992 have been endorsed and updated by the government's strategic review released this week. I have already spoken about the review in parliament this week, but I think some basic points are worthy of emphasis. There are five factors that I want to mention today. Firstly, economic growth and modernisation in South-East Asia will continue over the next decade. Perhaps that is a very clear and obvious point to make, but it is an important one because of its implications for the strategic assessment. With greater economic strength, the review notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the challenge will be to maintain the regional standing of the ADF as our traditional capability-edge narrows . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, the review notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Asia is one of the few areas of expanding arms sales.</PARA>
<PARA>The review also says that we do not have an arms race, but it is also a fact that, with the building industrial base and the greater economic success of our neighbours, their capacity to build their military forces is greatly enhanced. Secondly, with more open economies there should be greater political representation of the emergent middle classes and continuing political stability. In turn, the review states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the prospects are good for our active involvement over the 1990's in a `regional security community'.</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the review points out that the strategic thinking of the United States has changed since the end of the Cold War. Dick Cheney, the former US Secretary of Defense, expressed the view recently that the US is more isolationist. Whether we accept that view or not, there is no doubt that we have seen a reduction in its military presence in our region and that has an impact obviously on our own strategic assessment. Fourthly, on page 14 of the strategic review 1993, it concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our strategic outlook for the 1990's is more complex and uncertain, although not immediately more threatening.</PARA>
<PARA>Fifthly, the review notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that Australia contributes to global endeavours to develop new multilateral security mechanisms and to prevent proliferation. New international security mechanisms can only complement the security we gain from a strong, independent defence posture focused on the defence of Australia, strategic engagement in our region, and the vigorous alliance with the US.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me synthesise that into two points. Firstly, Australia's situation is not more benign. Secondly, the role of the Australian military forces in the years ahead will be a changing one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of both of those factors, we should ask ourselves: if our circumstances are changing&mdash;which is going to cost us money in the end&mdash;and, secondly, if our strategic assessment is not more benign, then how does the government justify slashing funding? I think that is a very significant question. The significance is perhaps sharpened by the government's current approach. When it comes to money it was outlined recently in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jane's Defence Weekly</EMPHASIS> interview with the Australian Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made the judgement in 1991 that there would be no more real increases in defence spending this decade. Therefore to meet some of those capital equipment requirements we have to generate internal savings. What we will face over the next four years is a 2.25 per cent reduction in spending. That won't make it easy but we have indicated we wouldn't want to go any lower. I'm not expecting to go back every year to fight off another series of cuts. The Finance Department may have some views on that and we'll see who'll win.</PARA>
<PARA>Exactly! We will see who is going to win in this tug of war over the question of the ongoing financing of Australia's defence efforts. But, as the minister himself makes quite clear, this government's policy is to cut defence spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cutting defence spending has an impact right across the defence portfolio, particularly when the government has already entered into a series of commitments to purchase capital equipment. In other words, we have been on a program, going back to the Fraser years, to buy a lot more equipment for our defence forces. So the government is locked into purchasing a range of capital equipment which means that if we want to cut the defence expenditures then, because we are already committed to buying a new ship, aeroplane or whatever, the impact of those cuts tends to be on the personnel side. When we think about it, ultimately the success of our defence effort is reliant on our people. Yet we have seen in recent years a considerable emphasis on cuts to personnel expenditure. We have also seen cuts to the operational readiness as the government has tried to make do with the limited dollars that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, my message is that the defence of this country could not be more important. The funding of it is a critical issue. It is one which is very high on my list of priorities as the incoming shadow minister for defence. If there is one message out of my remarks today for those interested in defence issues, it is that I will be campaigning strongly to ensure, both in coalition and in government policy, that the necessary expenditure for our proper defence of this country is made available by the political process. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although in the main the appropriation bills are concerned with minor variations across a wide range of programs, departments and agencies, I draw the attention of the House to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and the government's additional commitment to aged and retiree care. In allocating another $15.2 million to cover the associated running costs of extending fringe benefits to all pensioners and $14.6 million for the care of veterans in non-departmental health institutions, the government is ensuring the effective implementation of policies that guarantee all our elderly, whether they be pensioners, veterans or self-funded retirees, a secure and better quality of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of fringe benefits to part-pensioners, and from July to self-funded retirees on low incomes, reflects the Labor government's dedication to ensuring the needs of older Australians are properly and adequately met. Taking care of the elderly not only is morally and socially right, but under the Keating government is a priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's record in this area speaks for itself. We have enabled aged retirees to stay in their own homes, comfortable in the knowledge that the government has provided and expanded home and community care services. It was also the Labor government which linked social security allowances and benefits to the consumer price index, reviewing pensions twice a year in line with the CPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As result of this and many other initiatives, the standard of living for our elderly has improved by about 14 per cent in real terms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initiatives such as the extension of pensioner fringe benefits and concessions to assist part-pensioners reconfirm the continuing commitment of the Labor government to improve the standards of living for older Australians. In July this year, all retirees of pensionable age who have limited income, that is, below the pension cut-out point, will also receive the new all-in-one fringe benefits seniors card. This seniors concession card initiative means that self-funded retirees on fixed incomes, who previously missed out on assistance because they were only moderately asset rich but income poor, will now become eligible for government assistance. </PARA>

These are the people who grew up during the Depression, who went to the war and who are now living their lives in a country that they made what it is today.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, I was the chairman of the Standing Committee on Expenditure inquiry into aged care policies, which came up with proposals that became the home and community care program. In the late 1980s, I was the chairman of the Prime Minister's aged care task force which went around Australia talking to people about what the government could do to improve the living standards of retirees. The seniors concession card is a direct outcome of the work of that committee. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems the biggest hurdle we face in meeting the growing demand to look after the greying population is the indifferent approach by state and local governments. Honourable members will recall the difficulties that we had last year with the New South Wales government, which was not willing to meet its contribution to the home and community care program. The Fahey government was so parsimonious that it would not match the Commonwealth's grant and people in my electorate found that their services had been reduced&mdash;a scandalous approach by the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that local government as well is not shouldering its share of the burden. I find it unfortunate to have to talk today about the Rockdale Municipal Council and Hurstville City Council in my electorate. These two councils, with their multimillion dollar budgets, have decided to axe the voluntary rate rebate to concession card holders. These are not councils that are poor. The Hurstville council has very significant assets, a very significant rate base, a very large income and very highly paid staff. The Rockdale council is very much the same. But it has decided, in a very parsimonious approach that is typical of the approach that the Fahey government has been taking in New South Wales, to do away with this concession. At a time when the Commonwealth government is trying to expand the benefits that are payable and provided to older Australians, these parsimonious local authorities are trying to wind back provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Rockdale council, by cutting the voluntary component of rate rebate it will save a total of $60,000. In the case of the Hurstville council, it will save $115,000. They are small amounts, but they mean a lot to the people who are losing the concession. As many of the distressed constituents who contacted my electorate office this week pointed out, the savings are minute. They could have easily been made by cutting out some ratepayer funded junket that aldermen on local government authorities in New South Wales are often quite happy to go on. It might be a good thing for the Hurstville and Rockdale councils to send one fewer staff member or a few fewer aldermen to some parks conference or something such as that and start to put some of the effort back in for the people who elect them to the local council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a few thousand dollars, hundreds of pensioners throughout the St George area have been made to suffer because of these two councils' uncaring attitudes. I have received dozens of phone calls and letters from distressed and angry pensioners in my electorate about the cutting of these rebates. These cuts represent between $20 and $80 a year to most of these people. That does not seem like a great deal of money, particularly to people on high incomes such as us. It does not mean that they will go without food and clothing. It is simply a matter of dignity and, for some, the difference between being able to buy a present for a grandchild and lashing out and buying a new piece of clothing for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday, I received a call from an 81-year-old pensioner, Mr Curtis of Millet Street, Hurstville, saying that on his estimation he was going to lose about $3 a week because of the meanness&mdash;and that is all it is&mdash;of the Hurstville City Council. Mr Curtis said he lives just near the Hurstville and Kogarah councils' boundary. It is interesting to point out that in the St George region of south-western Sydney there are three local government authorities&mdash;Rockdale, Hurstville and Kogarah. Mr Curtis lives on the railway line&mdash;adjacent to the railway line in Hurstville. I think Mr Curtis wishes that most of the aldermen lived on the railway line and the six o'clock train was coming through in a bit of a hurry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that as he looks out his front door across the railway line to Kogarah council he sees houses that are not all that much different to his. When he goes for a walk on the other side of the railway line, the people over there&mdash;the same sort of people&mdash;get the benefit because the Kogarah council, at least in this instance, has been decent. Mr Curtis, like thousands of other pensioners in my electorate, cannot understand why these glaring disparities in areas so close and similar to each other are allowed to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Curtis pointed out, the property values on which council rates are based are increasing while pensioner incomes are pretty much fixed. Mr Curtis and other pensioners who have rung me have pointed out that they were really able to use the benefit that the Commonwealth had given them by expanding the concessions to include people in this category. For most of them, it was something that they would look forward to for a year or so knowing that it was going to be a little bit extra in their pocket. They would get a little bit extra in their pockets if they lived in Kogarah, but not if they lived in Hurstville or Rockdale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A typical letter that I received this week is from Mr Harry Hutt of Churchill Street, Bardwell Park. Mr Hutt summarises the actions of the Hurstville council like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Federal Government under Paul Keating has demonstrated in many ways that it cares for pensioners, for example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its decision to grant very worthwhile tax concessions to pensioners, so that many pensioners pay little or no tax.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its decision to grant all pensioners fringe benefits&mdash;a substantial concession of significant financial assistance to pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hutt continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rockdale Council's decision negates Federal Labor policy to pensions in that Council has taken away a previous entitlement of pensioners. In other words Council has negated Federal Government policy on fringe benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that is not entirely accurate because in New South Wales there are minimum mandatory rate rebates, which were legislated by a previous Labor government. Nevertheless, I, like thousands of other people in Watson, find it absolutely scandalous that Hurstville and Rockdale councils want to take between $20 and $80 a year off a pensioner. As Mr Hutt said in his letter, `Surely this comparatively trivial amount could be saved in other less harmful ways'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that with a bit of creative thought Hurstville council could save $115,000 somewhere in its budget, and that Rockdale council could save a lesser amount, to allow this rebate to continue. As I said earlier, maybe they could give less thought to some of the things they send people to. These aldermen are very busy at present asking the state government, through the so-called local government remuneration tribunal in New South Wales, to pay them more. It makes me wonder how much it will cost Hurstville and Rockdale councils to pay these greedy aldermen a bit more and how better that money might be spent to help those people who have been ratepayers, in many instances, all their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have paid council rates all their lives. When those ratepayers retire Hurstville and Rockdale councils say, `You have been pretty good living here all your life; you have paid your rates and you have been a decent person, but don't ask us to help you any more. Even though the Commonwealth and state governments are willing to give you a rebate, don't ask us to keep the concession going. But the aldermen do need a little more pay, the aldermen do need another trip, and we will waste money in that way'. Maybe a few less new cars for the council officers and a few less civic receptions might be better than taking this concession off the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What raises my wrath is the fallacy that these councils are claiming that they cannot afford the rebate because of the additional number of part pensioners who became entitled last April to the seniors concession card and the associated fringe benefits. Earlier last year the councils were trying to weasel out of giving the rebate. They said, `It is not quite clear what the Commonwealth is going to do and we have to get compensation'. The Commonwealth said that it was going to provide compensation because of this concession card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth did not shirk from its responsibility. It said, `If we are going to ask other agencies, such as state and local authorities, to provide to part pensioners the same fringe benefits that full pensioners get, then we will give you some compensation'. We stood up and did what it cost us to do, but these weaselly local authorities are saying that it is very unclear. It is not unclear. They know what the facts are; they know what the truth is. It is time the voters in the municipalities woke up to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has given state and local government additional funds for the costs that were associated with the expansion of the fringe benefit concessionary entitlements. We have allocated in total $86.638 million to state governments as part of an ongoing compensation package. New South Wales got over $50 million in compensation that will assist with the cost of extending the fringe benefits to part pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that old Premier Fahey does not let a little money slip through his hands without having some of it stay on his hands. We saw the scandalous arrangement last year when he held on to Commonwealth money under the HACC program to balance his books before passing it on to the local HACC committees. He has done the same thing with this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given the New South Wales state government $50 million to help compensate it for the cost of this concession card. It is hard to discern exactly what is happening because the councils have not made any mention of compensation. It is difficult to even get a figure out of them as to how many concession card holders they have. I do not know how much in compensation the councils have been able to apply for, but I do know that they have been able to apply for compensation from February this year, again in June and then each quarter from then on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the few figures that I have to hand from Hurstville council, I know the argument that it cannot afford the voluntary rebates because of additional concession card holders is completely and utterly spurious. Last year Hurstville council had 5,511 pensioners on its books receiving a rebate. This year the numbers increased to 5,856&mdash;345 more than last year. It is easy to see that the Hurstville council will probably make money by putting the squeeze on the pensioners. Anyone can tell by looking at these numbers that it will come out very nicely with its compensation funding and with the money it will save in future years from the cutting of this rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must and should be remembered that rebates were introduced to ease the financial burden of people on fixed incomes to meet council rates, which are based on property values. Hurstville and Rockdale councillors should hang their heads in shame for putting the squeeze on pensioners, particularly when, as I said earlier, they are pushing for an increase in their aldermanic allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These same councils refused to even give a part rebate to new concession card holders last April. They claimed that they could not give the rebate unless people had a concession card at the beginning of the year, in January. So they stole half the year's rebate from pensioners. These councils failed to tell their ratepayers that under another section of the Local Government Act voluntary rebates are made at the discretion of the individual council. They know that they could have given the rebate, but they told the people, `Unless you had the card in January, we cannot help you'. They obviously copped so much flak last year for this low act that they have decided to avoid the problem all together this year by scrapping the rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These councils may and often do justify their actions by talking about the great service they provide for the elderly. It is just sad that they are usually referring to programs which are funded in large amounts by the Commonwealth, such as the home and community care program and the Meals on Wheels service. As honourable members know, the predominant funding for those programs comes from federal and state governments, not from the local authorities. The actions of Hurstville and Rockdale councils in taking this rebate away from elderly ratepayers are nothing short of disgraceful. They should think again. I intend to remind voters when the next election comes around just how miserly these councils have been. They ought to take a bit of a pay cut themselves. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

At the end of that first meeting she had signed a blank cheque, a blank piece of paper, no conditions, to hand over our standard gauge railway&mdash;the only profitable component of the entire proposed national grid&mdash;and the jobs of all those who currently gain employment from that particular piece of railway line. I represent a number of those people in places such as Merredin. They were all to go and they knew it.

It was not a new mine as such. That was a mine replacing Hamersley's worked out current mining activities and necessary just to maintain Australia's export effort, something which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) like to stick their chests out and boast about. </PARA>

She did not use this money, which remained in her bank account for&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;two years and, as with the Prime Minister, two tax returns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually the matter became a subject of police investigations and, of course, impending political embarrassment. Did Carmen Lawrence decide to take it on the chin? No. She set about to conspire to entangle one of the then members of the opposition, in fact the then Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court, in a matter entirely unrelated to him in order to create a smokescreen.

As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, these things do not happen without such arrangements. Furthermore, in this case she was the author of this thing&mdash;just to protect herself from the fact that she had kept $5,000 of public moneys in her bank account. What is more, Carmen Lawrence had good reason to know that Penny Easton had not committed perjury in claiming to the Family Court that her husband had received additional government golden handshakes, because Carmen Lawrence knew that Easton had secretly received such moneys from the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can choose very easily in the electorate of Fremantle. They can choose a voice in the wilderness with Geoff Hourn and thereby support the tirade of abuse and personal denigration we have heard from the honourable member for O'Connor, or they can choose a competent, able, dedicated woman in Carmen Lawrence, who will bring to this place a very strong voice as a member of a government that listens to people and that is steering this economy into growth&mdash;the highest growth we have seen for many years&mdash;higher employment and stability. That will be their choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to devote the rest of my remarks to the appropriation bills before us and say something about the improvement in the economy as well as comment on the coal industry and the effect it has on employment in my electorate. This year we are beginning on a much better note than last year; there is growth now in the economy. The figures that came out in the revision of the budget estimates a few weeks ago show that the growth in the total value of goods and services produced in this country this financial year is expected now to be 3 1/2 per cent rather than the 2 3/4 per cent that was forecast at budget time. That is very good news. We are looking at a growth rate of four per cent next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That 3 1/2 to four per cent increase in gross domestic product is the magic figure whereby we then start to pull down the pool of unemployment. Until we get beyond that 3 1/2 per cent, particularly as the participation rate changes, we will have difficulty in trying to reduce the pool of unemployment. There is one problem for us in that: as the number of jobs grows and the opportunity for employment increases, people who had previously dropped out will be coming back into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment growth in 1993-94, forecast to be three-quarters of one per cent at budget time, now is at the level of about 1 3/4 per cent. We had expected an increase of 100,000 in the number of jobs created in this financial year, but that has now been revised to 200,000. Those figures really give hope to the rest of the community and to those people seeking employment. As well, we had expected to see a reduction in the forecast inflation rate, or the consumer price index, of the order of 3 1/2 per cent, but it is back to under two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at an increasing growth rate, the lowest interest rates in 20 years, the lowest inflation rate in 30 years and the lowest level of industrial disputes since the 1960s, we can see that there is a good, stable base being established in the economy and very good prospects for growth.That is best reflected in the growing optimism among people that we are seeing now right around Australia. Things are getting better; we are past the worst. The growth is not coming fast enough at this stage but it will improve. The important thing is that the worst is behind us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook for the year ahead of us is much better than the outlook at this time last year. It was then much more spotty. We thought there would be improvement, but the rate of improvement did not develop as fast as we had hoped. To take an external index&mdash;an outside referee&mdash;the Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment shows that consumer confidence is at its highest level for five years. In my own area, the central coast of New South Wales and the Hunter, there is a much more optimistic outlook. All the jobs have not come there yet but people are feeling more optimistic. Things are starting to happen and new jobs are starting to be created. The task now is to accelerate the growth, and so create new jobs, as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to the coal industry. It is an industry which produces $A7.5 billion per year in exports, but it is open slather in that industry. No clear strategy for the coal industry has been put forward by the government, by the industry itself or by the trade unions. They have been working on developing a strategy, but what we effectively have is open slather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal reserves are under the control of state governments and, particularly in New South Wales, it is just open slather. Underground coalmines, with valuable coal reserves intact, are being closed down. The coal is being squandered or sterilised, and new mines are being opened up with overseas investment. It is a very clever strategy of our buyers, particularly the Japanese, to invest in coal loading facilities and new coalmines and to open up new sources of coal supply so that they can keep a lid on Australia's demand for better prices. In that way they can generate more supply and so ensure that the price is kept within the margin that they want it kept within, without regard to the effect that it has on Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this open slather policy, organised buyers&mdash;and Japan takes 50 per cent of our coking coal&mdash;are getting together and working out a strategy. They have a clear strategy&mdash;which I referred to in this House the other day&mdash;which is set out in the Akira Chimura report which was published a few months ago. It is a clear strategy by organised buyers of our largest export to depress prices, generate oversupply and benefit Japanese steel mills at the expense of this country's foreign earnings, its coal workers and the Australian coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a coalminer loses a job in the Hunter region you can bet your bottom dollar that three other people will lose their jobs as well, because that is the rate of the multiplier effect. The businesses that supply and service the equipment in the mines and supply the materials that go to underground and open-cut coalmining will be affected. So when one coalmining job goes three other jobs go, and the loss of those jobs will be to the benefit of purchases of Australian coal by Japanese steel mills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese invest in those coalmines and in the loading facilities. They then have full access to the cost structures of the mines or facilities that they are part of. They are in a very powerful position to know what they can extract from their suppliers and what the mills can extract from the suppliers of coal in terms of price reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They mouth the words when they say, `Since the Japanese steel mills want certainty of supply, then they should ensure that there is investment in Australian facilities to maintain that continuity'. However, that is not the real reason. The real reason is to get access to the information, to get the guts of their opponents' business, to know how hard to squeeze without strangling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They can squeeze right down until the industry is just surviving, but not actually dead, and that is what is happening in the Hunter region. That is what is happening in the Australian coal industry. Effectively, what has happened over the last 10 years, and particularly in the last five years since 1988, is that the benefits of improvement in the coal industry&mdash;with changed shift arrangements, changed working arrangements, multiskilling, better training, altered roster arrangements, around-the-clock working, seven-day working&mdash;all those productivity benefits, substantial as they are, have gone to the Japanese steel mills in respect of coking coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan has a similar strategy in respect of steaming coal. Let me just say that there is nothing wrong with airing this issue here. The Japanese are our customers, but they are much more open about this as an industry in Japan. They are dealing with buyers. They want to buy as cheaply as they can. They prepare their strategy papers. They publish their strategy papers. They meet as a group. They organise. They plan. However, in this country what we have is a group of unorganised sellers and producers who are competing with each other, and yet they are trying to deal with a group of highly organised, competent and sophisticated buyers in the Japanese steel mills and even in the purchase of steam coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, all of those difficulties bring the industry to a sad and sorry state. In 1970 there were 37 underground mines in my region, in the Newcastle and the Central Coast regions. Today there are 17. Thirty-eight per cent of the industry is said to be making a loss. That is despite the productivity improvements. This is really a reflection of the depression in coal prices over the past five years particularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese have gained through price cuts in the last 10 years an amount that is equivalent to one-fifth of our overseas debt: $A31.2 billion dollars. That is the dollar value of what they have extracted from the Australian coal industry over the past 10 years. So the sacrifices are made; the changes are made; the restructuring goes on. But all the benefit of that has been passed directly to Japanese purchasers of Australian coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over 1992-93, 1,500 mineworkers were retrenched in the Hunter region, mostly in the Newcastle area. Only 150 of those persons have been re-employed over the last 12 months. At the current rate of re-employment, it may be five to six years before those men can expect to get back into regular employment. In comparison, during 1987-88, 2,000 mineworkers lost their jobs in the Hunter but most of them were able to get back into work by 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Shortland, two years ago there were seven underground mines operating. Today there are five: Newvale 2, Wallarah, Chain Valley Bay, Wyee and Munmorah. The Friday before last, Moonee Mine at Catherine Hill Bay joined the other closed mines of the area. Moonee was putting out 311,100 tonnes of saleable coal over 1992-93. It has 15 million tonnes of good coal, valuable coal, untouched. This is another 15 million tonnes of coal that is being squandered in this country with the closure of that mine. Newvale 2 is operating at a rate of 470,000 tonnes a year, reduced from 630,000 tonnes. Chain Valley Bay and Wallarah are in the process of undergoing cutbacks with the retrenchment of a further 60 workers. Both those mines are under contract, but the new owners are not committed to the current level of output of 1.8 million tonnes. Wyee mine supplies Vales Point power station with 1.65 million tonnes of coal per year and Munmorah mine supplies 1.1 million tonnes, which is split between Munmorah power station and Vales Point power station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right across those underground mines, good coal&mdash;not coal that is of low thermal value&mdash;is squandered, wasted, buried forever because of the commercial practice and because there is no clear, firm industrial strategy for the coal industry. Most of all, in New South Wales, there is an open slather policy. Catch-as-catch-can, they can go in: whoever wants to invest, can invest and open up new mines, close down existing mines, without any regard to the longer-term benefit to this nation. They will rue the day when those who follow us look back and see what we did with those valuable energy reserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In New South Wales the treatment by Pacific Power of its employees, as it has closed mines down, is nothing short of despicable. I do not think that I have seen, in all my experience in industrial relations and transport in this place and elsewhere before I came here, an organisation which handles its employees as badly as that organisation. It effectively amounts to terrorising employees. First it says, `Jobs are going to go. Your pit may close', then, `We are not sure about it', then, `It looks more likely', then, `We think 40 per cent of the work force is going to go, but we can't tell you which ones'. And so it goes on and on. Then decisions are made to shift the market across to private sector mines at the expense of the publicly owned mines such as Pacific Power. If ever there was an organisation that needs the cleaners through it and needs the top management looked at, it is that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that I feel so strongly about is the despicable way in which it has treated miners, and their families, whose life's work has been for the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. The workers have been treated with total disregard. The commission lives in an ivory tower. It does not seem to understand the anxiety and the worry of families when the income earner is threatened with unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the message I bring to honourable members in the parliament today. It is very difficult for the economy to grow fast enough in our region to make up for the jobs that have been destroyed in the Hunter region and the Central Coast region by the government of New South Wales. In areas such as mines, power stations, the bus services, the railways, the health services and all of those sectors where there are people with special trades and skills, one cannot suddenly just take, say, a mineworker who has been thrown out by the state government and transfer him to a position as a tourist guide. One cannot retrain people and swap them around like that, so families continue to be affected by trauma and suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, honourable members should not forget that there is a multiplier of about three to one in the mining industry so that, when one miner goes, four jobs are lost&mdash;his and the jobs of three others. That is the effect of unemployment in the Hunter. We have had difficulty in creating jobs fast enough for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the statement from the government at the end of April on employment and its consideration of the problems of the regions such as ours. I ask, as strongly as I can, that special consideration be given to long-term unemployed persons, the persons who are semiskilled or trade skilled, who have more difficulty than anybody else in trying to find employment again once they have lost their job. I put that request to the government in the expectation that it will be strongly and favourably responded to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sports rort affair has given all Australians a clear indication of how this government spends taxpayers' money. The Labor Party, it is now evident for all to see, has made pork-barrelling an art form and has apparently done so with impunity. In the whole of this sports rorts affair it has become quite obvious that there are substantial benefits for those who are fortunate enough&mdash;and I use those words fairly loosely&mdash;to live in a safe or marginal Labor seat. There is no doubt that, on the measure of the sports rorts affair, safe Liberal seats are very much at the end of the government's priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible to argue, as the honourable member for Canberra and Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has, that demographics demand more spending in Labor electorates because in many respects they are poor by virtue of their being Labor seats, but I want to tell the House today that this is not always the case. A socioeconomic status index based on the latest census actually ranks my electorate of McPherson ninth lowest of 147 electorates in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of McPherson, which is based on the Queensland Gold Coast, actually has a number of what are perceived as negative factors in making this calculation. We have, for example, the highest proportion of people over 65 years of age. We have one of the highest unemployment rates and, interestingly, at the other end of the scale, we have a very high proportion of families with incomes below $16,000. We have a very low number of families on incomes above $60,000&mdash;just 10 per cent. Overall, we are ranked 127 out of 147 electorates in terms of the highest levels of unemployment. So on the basis of the census statistics, my electorate of McPherson and, to a very large extent, the adjoining electorate of Moncrieff&mdash;the Gold Coast as a whole&mdash;actually ranks in some respects as poor. Of course, the Gold Coast has many positive aspects as well, but in demographic terms we might well be regarded as poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been ranked very low because both of those electorates, fortunately&mdash;and I certainly give credit to the constituents in my electorate and in the electorates of my colleagues for their sound judgment&mdash;have chosen to make themselves safe Liberal electorates. This is reflected, of course, in the level of services that we actually receive from the government. There are a number of glaring examples of the treatment of the Gold Coast generally compared directly with the adjoining seats of Richmond and Page just on the other side of the New South Wales border, in the northern rivers area of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to say about the Gold Coast in this context is that it is also the fastest growing part of Australia and yet government services consistently fail to keep up with that growth. Often that is purely as a result of poor planning by governments at both federal and state levels. I could give a number of example of this. We have on the Gold Coast the Gold Coast University College of Griffith University. I have consistently pointed out in this place how inadequately funded it is. It has never been able to go anywhere near meeting the demand for places in it. Total QTAC preferences for courses at Griffith in 1994 were 14,821 and yet only 1,097 new places were provided at Griffith University on the Gold Coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in total QTAC preferences this year was 21 per cent above last year's figure and yet the government goes nowhere near meeting the demand for places at that university. Interestingly, across the border in the electorates of Page and Richmond the government has plans to spend $50 million building the Southern Cross University. That is an example of its priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about veterans affairs matters, my electorate has a very large number of veterans. For some time I have been attempting to have a Veterans' Affairs office opened up on the Gold Coast. One has been promised for early this year and that after a lot of hard lobbying. However, the northern rivers had one opened just before the last election. It also had, at the same time, a permanent office of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service put there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting fact is that the Gold Coast has twice as many veterans as the northern rivers area. We have 500 Vietnam veterans and 432 of their dependents as well compared to the northern rivers area of 298 veterans and 294 dependents. But we have to wait. The government gives the excuse that we are close to Brisbane but for anyone who knows the difficulties associated with travelling from the Gold Coast to and from Brisbane, that is a very poor excuse indeed. The fact is that Richmond and Page on the other side of the border are marginal Labor electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court Counselling Service is another example. This service has only just this week been reinstated on the Gold Coast. It was taken away in December 1991 because it was being over utilised and counsellors could not meet the demand for their services. When I took this matter up with the Attorney-General he said it was the Family Court's fault for not allocating funds to the Gold Coast. However, the Chief Justice of the Family Court told me that it was the Attorney-General who had not given them enough money to do it. The fact was it took us two years to get this vital service reinstated on the Gold Coast. It took an enormous amount of effort, not only on my own part but also on the part of a large number of local residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another federal government service that is provided to Australians generally is ABC radio and yet on the Gold Coast, believe it or not, we are still waiting for the ABC Radio National and fine listening service. My predecessor, going back a number of years, had been pushing for this. Promises have been made consistently by ministers to him and to me but they have always been broken. We are still not sure when the Gold Coast is going to have this very basic ABC service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go across the New South Wales border into Richmond and Page and what do we find? Of course, it is not difficult to guess. They have ABC Radio National on both the AM and FM band and they also have the ABC Triple-J service as well, which is not available on the Gold Coast either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It boils down very clearly to a matter of planning and priorities. The Gold Coast and the federal electorates that are based there have been given no priorities for planning to take account of the incredible growth there. After listening to the debate over the sports rorts affair it has become quite obvious to all what many of us knew anyway, that this is the way that the Labor party runs the country. I think that that is a very poor state of affairs indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corrupt way that the Labor Party wields power is not confined to pork-barrelling. In many respects, unfortunately, most people seem to think that pork-barrelling is somehow normal or excusable, although the extent to which Minister Kelly has taken it has put it beyond that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to spend a few minutes looking at the ABC. Many Australians are concerned about the perceived Labor Party bias in the ABC. When we look at the situation, we can see that there are obviously some very strong and longstanding connections between the ABC and the ALP. One wonders, for example, whether the new screening time for the rebroadcast of question time, that is, 1 o'clock in the morning, is as a result of the Prime Minister getting on the phone to his mate David Hill. We also know David Hill's background, the boss of the ABC: strong ALP connections going way back to the time he worked for Mr Wran, who was then the Premier of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now the Prime Minister has said to Mr Hill, `We have downgraded question time. We do not want to be too accountable for our actions, so let us make sure that the bulk of Australians that want to watch the rebroadcast of question time have to stay up till 1 o'clock in the morning to do it'. I do not think any of them are going to be too enthusiastically waiting up until 1 o'clock to see question time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member does not like it. Another director of the ALP is Rod Cameron. He has worked for the ALP for years. He has been its official pollster and he has been appointed to the ABC board. Not one of the seven principles which are on page 1 of the annual report refers to independence. There are all sorts of other you-beaut things the ABC is in favour of, like being identifiably Australian and so on and so on, but nothing about it being independent. One can seriously question whether it is when it is run effectively by mates of the ALP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent sacking of Pamela Bornhorst, who was the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> presenter in Queensland, was politically motivated. I asked some questions of the then Minister for Communications here about that. Of course, he said it was not, but it was quite clear that her sacking was politically motivated. Premier Goss had refused to be interviewed on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Brisbane for some time. Miss Bornhorst herself said at the time that she was `out of favour with the government'. There is plenty of evidence, I believe, in the sacking of Mrs Bornhorst that there was direct and indirect involvement, not only by Mr Goss but by some of his other people, particularly Minister Mackenroth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992-93 annual report of the ABC shows that ABC revenue from the government was $575.6 million. That is 9c a day for every Australian. It used to be 8c. People will like to know that it has gone up to 9c a day that we are all paying for the ABC. Every Australian has a vested interest in the ABC; we own it. As we own it, we have a right to believe that it will present a wide diversity of views. But it very often does not. One of the complaints I often get from people who listen to the ABC&mdash;and I must say that I spend a good deal of time watching and listening to the ABC&mdash;is that it is not entirely independent. The point I am making today&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) does not like it very much, but let me make the obvious conclusion&mdash;is that it is not entirely independent, not only because of the composition of its board but because of a whole lot of other connections, which I do not have not time to go into today, although I might do so on another occasion, that exist between the ALP and the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Talking about Australians owning the ABC&mdash;which we do&mdash;let me say to the House today that the ALP's decision to televise what they call the `highlights' of Sydney's annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras should concern most Australians. It would probably be fairer to say that they are going to be televising the `lowlights'! It might well be that many Australians might want to withhold their 9c, at least on the day that that is televised. A recent poll showed that 75 per cent of Australian people were against the televising of this particular event. Surely the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras in Sydney is against normal community standards. Yet, when this was taken up with the ABC, an ABC executive by the name of Vaughan Hinton said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as the ABC is concerned, we have a charter to reflect Australian life in all of its diversity, and the mardi gras is part of that diversity.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to say to him that many would regard it as perversity, not diversity. In any case, even if there were an argument for televising that particular event, perhaps he would like to run the same argument that maybe we see that paedophiles or rapists or murderers are part of the diversity too&mdash;but that does not mean that we encourage them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is worse than that. The ABC actually plans to televise the highlights, or lowlights&mdash;however you see it&mdash;of this event at 8.30 p.m. on a Sunday night, 6 March. I do not want to give it any commercials, but I want to say that 8.30 p.m. is family viewing time on a Sunday night for a lot of kids these days. I do not particularly mind if people want to go to Sydney and watch the parade&mdash;it might be quite a spectacle. But I really question whether we want it televised into our lounge rooms at 8.30 on a Sunday night. In this year, the International Year of the Family, that seems to be ironically inconsistent. Surely, if they have to telecast this event, they could do it at 2  o'clock  in  the  morning,  after  question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It shows something interesting about the ABC's priorities that it wants to rebroadcast the lowlights of the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras at 8.30 on a Sunday night, but that it puts question time on at 1 o'clock in the morning. The connections between the ABC and the ALP run very deep, and that should concern Australians, since we own the ABC. Much of what the ABC does is commendable. Many of us spend a lot of time watching the ABC. I reckon I get my 9c worth a day. But we ought to be concerned to ensure that, firstly, it is independent, and, secondly, that it does not get too carried away by some people who want to push agendas such as the televising of the particular event I was just talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also should concern Australians that this country is run by the ALP, with many of its union mates calling the shots. The Cooke inquiry in Queensland exposed the backroom deals and highly questionable behaviour that are commonplace in the trade union movement and in the Labor Party. The New South Wales right wing, in particular, is running the country from Canberra, and that is the reason that the honourable member for Canberra remains as Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That observation brings me back to my starting point. The minister is part of the royal family which is headed by Emperor Keating. It is obvious to us&mdash;and, I am sure, to everyone on the other side of the House&mdash;that that is the reason that she is still in her position today. She and her activities as minister stand as a dreadful indictment of the way the Labor Party runs this country: on the basis of patronage and of vote buying and, ultimately, of what one can only regard as being extreme political corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the sports rorts affair has done nothing other than to make that fact obvious to every Australian, then the minister has done us a great service because, to all Australians, obvious it has now become. In the context of the general remarks I have made in this debate, I would like to sum up by saying that many people despair of the way the fabric of our society is being shredded at the moment by the Labor Party and by this government. I hope that the next election, which may be as long as a couple of years away, will not be too late for the people of Australia to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the previous speaker, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), I will deal with realities rather than theoretical rubbish that I think he spoke of. I would like to draw to the attention of this House the recently announced strategies for growth in Australian horticulture by the federal government's horticultural task force. Whilst talking about the merits of this report, I would also like to take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House the positive growth and direction that have been taken by the primary industry groups in Tasmania and, more particularly, in the Huon and Channel regions in my electorate of Franklin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the horticultural task force has been forwarded to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) for his consideration. The task force was established in response to the Industry Commission inquiry into horticulture and was asked to develop an export growth strategy for the horticultural industry. This export growth strategy was based on the ongoing work of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation and the Horticultural Policy Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the horticultural task force impacts upon industries within the southern part of my electorate, namely, the apple and pear industry, the small fruit industry, the wine industry, the stone fruit industry and the fertiliser industry. On 30 November last year I arranged for the horticultural task force to meet with representatives of these industries, with a view to the task force familiarising itself with the specific concerns of this region and for those concerns to be put to the task force directly by industry representatives themselves. I would like to take this opportunity to report to the House what this horticultural task force found when it visited these industries in the Huon and Channel area of Tasmania and the consequent report by the horticultural task force in relation to these specific industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first stop on the task force itinerary was an establishment called Tascrays, a seafood catch and processing industry which has diversified into fertiliser products. The fertiliser developed by Tascrays is rather unusual in that it incorporates fish waste in combination with forest waste&mdash;mostly chips and bark&mdash;mulching this into what can only be described as a superb compost. This fertiliser, named OR-90, is currently being trialled by different sections of the horticultural industry, including the apple and pear industry and the Department of Transport and Works roadside planting division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compost, made completely from primary industry waste, has the wonderful capacity to not only promote tremendous growth but to also balance the pH levels in poor soils common to this area. The Huon Valley suffers badly from acidic soils, and currently the orchardists use sulfates, phosphates and nitrates as fertilisers and are dependent then on using lime to neutralise the acid content of their soils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the closure of Benders Quarry&mdash;a rather contentious subject in my electorate&mdash;local farmers lost their local and reasonably cheap supply of lime. Although at that stage I was not in agreement with the closure of Benders Quarry, the closure is now a fact of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local orchardists do have a continuing problem with their acidic soils, so methods must be found to solve those problems. The cost of lime to orchardists has increased due to the transportation costs involved in moving the lime from the only area available at present, which is in the north of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When faced with problems like these, sometimes it is necessary to not just look at solving the problem by replacing what has been lost but to look at other methods that may be used to reduce dependence on certain commodities such as lime. I see my role as one of instigating avenues for research into alternatives for the reduced use of lime by orchardists, and I am hopeful that the compost produced from seafood and forestry waste may just be that alternative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must add here that the state Liberal government and the Minister for Primary Industry, the former Premier, Robin Gray, have been sitting on their hands on this issue. They must come on board to help solve the problem of acidic soils and the supply of lime. It is not just a case of the federal government picking up and running with the issue. It is a matter for state and Commonwealth cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no longer the time to attack the federal government over its closure of the Benders Pty Ltd quarry. As I said previously, the quarry is closed and that is that. We must now work together to solve this problem so that our horticultural industry can prosper and develop further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stop on the itinerary for the task force was to visit representatives of the stone fruit industry of Tasmania. This industry is in a very positive position for growth, following a number of years of decline. Although, currently, the industry is only able to supply mostly domestic markets, its sights, like those of many other industries in Tasmania, are set on the South-East Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian primary producers have enthusiastically taken up the message of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Australian industry about focusing on our region for trade. The stone fruit industry in Tasmania is in an ideal position to target Asian markets due to a number of factors, including its fruit-fly free status and its clean green image. In addition, there are no codling moths in the orchards. If this were properly recognised by markets in Japan it would be an added bonus to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Demand certainly outstrips supply in the stone fruit industry. The industry is now set to grow markedly. I note in the report by the horticultural task force that the transportation of horticultural products is now critical to the development of this industry. The task force, in one of its many recommendations, said that a technical committee should be established involving airfreighting providers and users to identify trends that will impact upon the availability and cost of airfreight for horticultural products, and to develop programs that ensure the cost-effective and reliable utilisation of airfreight by horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendations on handling methods and training schemes for airline staff need to be implemented quickly so that groups such as the stone fruit industry can be confident when their precious cargo is flown to export markets. If these recommendations are implemented soon, the Tasmanian stone fruit industry will be well placed for export expansion at this time when the industry is in a growth phase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note this morning that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) mentioned in his speech that the transportation of goods is a problem and one which he feels has not been adequately addressed. If he is aware of any specific problems, he should immediately take up those concerns with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I can assure the honourable member that his problem will be quickly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we had the situation where a Tasmanian shellfish exporter had extreme difficulties with airfreighting his products to Japan. I immediately contacted the then Minister for Transport and Communications, now Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, about this problem. Following my representations, new procedures were introduced within Qantas to solve the problem that beset the Tasmanian shellfish company. These changes and procedures will now benefit all companies around Australia. I implore the honourable member for Wakefield to come forward with details of his concerns over the transportation of primary industry goods because they can and will be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable members would already be aware of the fine wines produced in Tasmania. During its visit to southern Tasmania the horticultural task force visited the Elsewhere Vineyard. Representatives of the wine industry had the opportunity to put forward the views of some of the wineries, such as D'Entrecasteaux, Hartzview and Elsewhere. Concerns over the recent federal budget decisions were mentioned, and there were rather frank and fruitful discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that, when the industry has a difference of opinion over government decisions, the best way to find solutions to these types of problems is to see the industry directly involved. To that extent, I see myself as a conduit between the industry and the ministers responsible. The local wineries were particularly concerned with land use and the influx of residents buying out small parcels of land, thereby causing a rise in prices and having other implications that impacted on their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note that the horticultural task force has responded to that concern by recommending that the Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council develop regional approaches to structural adjustment in the horticultural industries, utilising interest subsidies, re-establishment grants and land trading to restructure production in regions where property sizes are too small to be viable. Consideration also needs to be given to providing funds directly from the Commonwealth through appropriate regional organisations, including private agricultural firms, farm organisations or local government, to farmers and farming groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The apple and pear industry in the Huon region is one which I am very close to and one with which I intend continuing a close working relationship. The apple and pear industry in the Huon is a very progressive group aggressively marketing its products into the Asian region. Unlike its mainland counterparts, its industry is export driven. The Huon apple and pear growers are leading the nation in this regard. The Huon region is unlike any other in Australia. It has particular qualities, and fortunately those qualities are what Asian buyers are looking for. The climate in the Huon ensures a particular type of apple, one with a hard skin and crisp bite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmania Apple and Pear Growers Association has had difficulty in getting value for money through its relationship with the Australian Horticultural Commission. This is primarily due to its export drive and its specific regional qualities. These concerns have been taken on board by the horticultural task force and I am pleased to see that the task force has recommended that the Australian Horticultural Commission continue to review its operations to enable it to operate flexibly in order to meet the diverse needs of different commodity groups, particularly in relation to the need to place an increased focus on export market developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here I would like to pay tribute to the President of the Tasmanian Apple and Pear Growers Association, Mr Tim Reid, who has shown the kind of leadership that is required in the modern world to promote the industry he represents. There will be continuing good news from this group in relation to export dollars and an increase in local jobs. I expect some further major announcements in relation to this in the near future. The Huon and Channel region is showing excellent prospects for economic and employment growth and has set in place the type of structural change that is required to propel itself into further export growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Senator Nick Sherry, the chairperson of the horticultural task force, for his hard and dedicated work. Senator Sherry has effectively, through the report of the horticultural task force, assisted the industry in the Huon and Channel region to set itself up ready for the turn of the century and beyond. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak this afternoon about the problems the townspeople of Wilcannia are experiencing. It is a town which has been in the news a lot lately and received nationwide publicity a month or two ago after some outbreaks of violence in the town.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before doing so, I would like to set the scene. Wilcannia is a town in western New South Wales, is based on the pastoral wool industry in a fairly arid area and is situated on the Darling River, 250 kilometres west of Cobar and about 200 kilometres east of Broken Hill. It contains some very beautiful sandstone buildings, including the post office, the police house and the court house. There are other sandstone buildings which have been abandoned and are derelict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time Wilcannia was known as the Queen of the West. It was one of the biggest inland ports, if not the biggest, in Australia. Wool was loaded onto the paddle-steamers that went down the Darling. Today most shops have been either closed or abandoned. Every shop in town, I think, is up for sale but one could not sell any of the shops; in fact, people cannot even give them away. The two main shops left are the main corner store, the grocery shop, and also the service station, and both of those are in danger of closing in the coming months. Incidentally, I bought petrol in Wilcannia the other day and paid 89.9c a litre, which contrasted rather markedly with the 54.9c a litre I paid in Sydney some time ago, a 35c a litre difference. That is something that country people have to put up with which city people forget about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one drives into Wilcannia, one sees Aborigines scattered around the town. Children will be hanging around street corners, and it seems to be immaterial whether school is on or not, and also a number of adults. There is very high unemployment amongst the Aboriginal people in Wilcannia, in excess of 95 per cent. These sorts of problems have been present to one degree or another for decades, but I believe the position has worsened considerably over the last 20 years. There is a fear in this town that if something is not done soon the town will close and, regrettably, it will end up as nothing much more than a glorified Aboriginal mission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The town has been torn apart in recent times by violence and vandalism aggravated by alcohol abuse. It has driven many fine citizens out of the town, both black and white. Every business, as I say, is up for sale and for many the situation is one of despair, and they feel nobody is interested. I believe that violence combined with alcoholism amongst the Aboriginal people on the scale that I alluded to is a relatively recent phenomenon in Australia and reflects many things, such as the disillusionment building up over time, and drug abuse creeping in. No-one in Australia knows yet how to deal with this problem, and the difficulty is that it is usually situated in small isolated towns, far from the big cities; Wilcannia is 1,000 kilometres from Sydney. It has been ignored largely. Nobody is particularly interested in it, but to solve the problem is going to need a lot of time and thought given by the best available people that we have in this country. There has to be a recognition that we have to do something about this problem. It has to have a special focus of attention and patience is going to be needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the House that time and effort expended in this area, though a considerable effort may be needed, will be well worth while because, if we can find a solution to help the Aboriginal people and help these towns, it will provide a blueprint for application elsewhere. I cannot overemphasise the magnitude and seriousness of the problem that exists not just in Wilcannia today but in Bourke tomorrow and Brewarrina the day after, and it is even building up in larger centres like Wellington and Dubbo. Nearly all of those towns, of course, are in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that any effort toward success, if it can be achieved, will be repaid a thousandfold, because we will not be just saving a town or towns. If we walk away from this problem, we are condemning a race of people to oblivion, and I believe that Wilcannia today offers the challenge. Crunch time has arrived for a decision to do something about this. If the problem is allowed to drift, if we just continue to salve our conscience by sending an extra policeman to the town or another social worker or whatever, as important as these things may be, we are avoiding our responsibility and the problem will continue and worsen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I offer solutions, I would like to examine the situation in a little further detail. As I say, unemployment in the Aboriginal population is over 95 per cent. There is a lower education standard amongst Aboriginal people than I believe there needs to be. There is almost total loss of tribal elder authority, which I find very sad. The Aborigines in that town own virtually nothing. They do not own any business at all. They hardly own a house between them; the houses they live in are rented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those things added together are the ingredients for a cauldron of trouble, disillusionment, despair and apathy. There are no meaningful pursuits for people to occupy their time. It is bad enough not having a job in, say, Sydney or Melbourne, but people without a job can occupy themselves in other ways. They can join various organisations, go to the beach or play sport, but unemployed people do not have most of those options in Wilcannia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what it does to Aboriginal youth. There is a very high truancy rate in Wilcannia as well as a drinking problem and petrol sniffing, and I believe that drugs alarmingly are creeping into the town. Then there is every degree of mischief available, from the milder types of vandalism to the more serious break-ins, and thieving in houses, shops and of cars right through to violent assault, which is a fairly new phenomenon. In one case recently a teenage youth belted a person staying at the caravan park over the head with a tree root just to steal a few dollars. The person who got belted over the head was in hospital in a coma for some months. These youth problems seem to start from about 12 to 13 years on. When they are combined with poor education and the fact that many of these children are subject to sexual abuse and that we are about to breed another generation without work&mdash;probably the second or third generation&mdash;we can see that the problem is very serious indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the adults have no jobs, and there is no incentive amongst the Aboriginal people to self-start with jobs because welfare, as we know, is fairly easy to get. Of course, all this ultimately leads to a lack of pride, a lack of purpose and a loss of dignity amongst these people. They soon drift into alcoholism which becomes entrenched and they end up with a total loss of self-respect. Amongst some Aboriginal people this breeds a resentment mentality. They end up with a chip on their shoulder against the law, against society as a whole and against history, some of which seems to be being rewritten for them. They end up with a negative outlook and with a `don't care' attitude. Their health suffers. Those who are heavily dependent on alcohol end up with pancreas and liver problems, eyesight problems, a low immunity to diseases, heart attacks and the DTs. Their hygiene deteriorates and the houses they live in are neglected. Rubbish can be seen accumulated in the yards, prams and toys on the roofs, old cars lying around and dogs wandering everywhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to see what happens with the families. The wives are frequently bashed, and I think they are the unsung victims of the situation. There is often sexual abuse of children. Children are neglected and there is little discipline. As I said earlier, there is a total breakdown of elder authority. We end up with a race of people with no direction and no purpose&mdash;in other words, a lost generation. We, as Australians, are witnessing the destruction of a race of people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can ask the question whether we should try to do something about it. And is there an answer? I believe we should try. If we claim to be a Christian society, if we claim to be a caring society, we must try. But is there an answer? I believe that despite the deteriorating situation there is an answer, although that answer has not yet been found. It does not lie in most of the present attempts that have been made. I hasten to add that money is not the answer, welfare is not necessarily the answer, and what has been tried to date is not necessarily the answer. These things are often part of the problem, although money in some instances could facilitate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need in towns like Wilcannia is a total rethink. There is no magic answer. We need pioneering ideas&mdash;ideas that are embedded in commonsense that come from the heart and the brain rather than from the cheque book. I stress that any attempt to succeed must not be half-hearted. The best people possible must be put in place to do the job or we may as well forget all about it and not try. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few obvious things that might be done for the youth. I believe that the truancy laws should be enforced to get the children to school. Of course, this is a state matter. Where damage has occurred in town, I believe the children should pay for it and, if necessary, the welfare cheques of the parents should be garnisheed. This would tend to make the parents more responsible than they have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We probably need a detention centre for youths in Wilcannia or, at the very least, in Broken Hill, 200 kilometres away. At present, to lock up a youth, police have to take the youth to Sydney, 1,000 kilometres away. This is patently ridiculous. We have to give more encouragement to children to go through and complete the Higher School Certificate. We have to give them a goal after this&mdash;in other words, a good chance of getting a job to make it worth their while. We have to breed a generation of responsible adults and, hence, responsible parents who will look after their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we should have organised activities after school. There are none in Wilcannia at present. Aboriginal children are naturally good at things like sport and cultural activities such as dance. In fact, in these areas, I would say they are considerably superior to white children. I believe they should give the best person they can find available&mdash;I know of such an Aboriginal person in Wilcannia&mdash;the authority and the wherewithal to do something with those children after school every day. They should be organised into activities, such as sport, and put into uniforms, as used to be the case several years ago. I think it would pay handsome dividends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the adults, there are some obvious things that can be done. I believe the alcohol-free zone in the town should be enforced. I have noted that, in other towns, where it has been enforced, it works very well indeed. All alcohol sold in glass should be banned; that has been done to a large extent. If necessary, I think we should very seriously consider banning alcohol 100 per cent in that town. That is a drastic step to take but, if it means saving the town, it may be well worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they are put down by the law, I believe fines should be enforced and, if necessary, they should be paid by garnisheeing the money out of the welfare cheques. In my hand, I have a notice of order for compensation for some windows broken at Max Helmers' store&mdash;I spoke about this earlier&mdash;amounting to $625. It says that it has to be paid back at $100 a month. I can tell honourable members now that not one dollar of that will be paid back. It never has been and never will be under the present system. This sort of nonsense has got to stop; it has to be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, something must be done about the horrific alcohol abuse problem in that town: Alcoholics Anonymous, education, all those types of things. In a town of less than 1,000 people, over 20,500 people were picked up for alcohol abuse in 1993. I think that illustrates more than anything else the magnitude of the problem.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a drying out halfway house in Wilcannia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To move onto the harder solutions, above all else, we need jobs for the Aboriginal people. It might be said that there is no work to be done in Wilcannia but that is wrong. There is a whole range of work from least skilled to most skilled. The least skilled could start by cleaning up the town. This could be continued right through to teaching Aboriginal people skills in the building industry, in the roadworks industry and that type of thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing in a town where Aborigines outnumber non-Aborigines by about four or five to one that the Aboriginal people do not own even one industry of their own. An obvious industry to consider for Aboriginal people in Wilcannia would be sandstone cutting. As I said, the town has many sandstone buildings; there is a lot of sandstone in the district. It is a product that is hard to purchase around Australia, and such an industry should be seriously considered. These people could be taught about the building industry, and in hands-on teaching they could restore some of the buildings in the beautiful town of Wilcannia. Roadworks need to be done. For example, they could start building the road between Wilcannia and White Cliffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The post office is up for sale. I am informed by the regional manager for the western area that Aboriginal people could be trained and are capable of running that post office. A grape growing industry could be started, similar to that in Menindee, to capture the early market. A cultural centre could be opened in the town. There are many opportunities. For example, the CDEP scheme&mdash;the work for the dole scheme&mdash;should be revamped in Wilcannia. When that is properly supervised it works very well, but it must be properly supervised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these suggestions do not necessarily mean spending more money because many of the wasteful dollars that are spent in this area could just be redirected. But, even if they cost more money, the individual lives saved, the rescuing of a race of people and the benefit that would accrue to the community would make the cost well worth while. When we are doing the sums as to whether or not we should do some of these things, we should factor in the benefit to the community: a dollar figure cannot be put on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined the very serious problem of despair which exists in one of the many towns in my electorate. Success, if it comes, will largely depend on the ability and commitment of all sectors of the community. We must have cooperation between the federal government and the state government; fault lies on both sides. These governments, which tend to be more centralised than they should be, must recognise the plight of country towns in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal particularly to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) in the federal parliament. If he is prepared to tackle this problem head-on, and if he will give an unequivocal commitment to do so, then I believe the rewards could be great, not just for Wilcannia but for all of Australia. I will take a very keen interest in his response to this matter, and I am sure the people of Wilcannia will too. We will do everything we can to assist on a bipartisan basis. The problem is so serious that it cannot be allowed to drift as it has in recent years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we discuss the appropriation of funds, much of which has been collected from taxpayers and the customers of government business enterprises, I wish to touch on defence, employment and industry, and the defence item I want to talk about relates a lot to employment and industry. The government is at the moment considering where the armaments depot, which is presently based in Sydney, should go. The choice has been narrowed down officially to two, with a third choice very much in the running. The official choices by government are Eden and Jervis Bay. The other choice is Point Wilson in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At lunchtime today I had the pleasure of taking a group from Bega Valley Shire to see the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) to discuss the possibility of the armaments depot going to Twofold Bay in Eden. Both the minister and the Bega Valley Shire representatives were well prepared and this led to a particularly useful discussion. As well, the shire representatives had the pleasure of talking to Captain Wally Warrington from the navy, who was able to give them some of the technical details that they wanted to hear about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message I got from what was said this morning was that we ought not to put a lot of effort into a big campaign for the Eden option at this stage because there is going to be a second round of decision making in the cabinet. I hope that round of decision making will be concluded by late March or early April so that we will know a bit more about what the government is thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be kept in mind that Point Wilson in Victoria has reasonable prospects of receiving the depot and that it will probably be in the running. At the moment there is a big question about the chemical works. There was a minor disaster at the chemical works in Melbourne, which could have been a major disaster of the significance of the Bhopal disaster, and the cost of moving those chemical works&mdash;which is about $200 million&mdash;may mean that Point Wilson is still in the running for the armaments depot, so it has to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The considerations that are being looked at include the maximisation of safety measures, including the safety of material travelling along roads, and we also need to consider&mdash;the government has acknowledged this&mdash;the economic effect on other industries so that there would be no economic harm to them if the navy's armaments depot did go to Twofold Bay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cabinet has assessed the two most likely alternatives, Jervis Bay and Twofold Bay. Twofold Bay, of course, has some disadvantages in relation to Jervis Bay. The government owns a lot of the land at Jervis Bay and there have been a lot of environmental studies there. In the case of Twofold Bay there are some title and weather problems. There is also the question of the continuation of the Harris-Daishowa woodchip mill, which will be viable for many years to come. It is pretty clear that it would be able to continue. Twofold Bay is also some distance from naval instrumentalities which would still remain in Sydney, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be about 60 visits per year apparently to the wharf which would be based at Twofold Bay if the base goes there. This would give scope for other use. The councillors who came with me today were able to talk about one of those alternatives being a wharf to service industry in the region, and the developing pine wood industry, for instance, would have a great opportunity for the sharing of a wharf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The navy would apparently have a year-wide program indicating when it would be used, and it is certainly a possibility that Twofold Bay would be a viable option. The people in Eden need to acknowledge that politics and the environmental movement may discount Jervis Bay. They need to acknowledge that if Victoria fails to cater for Point Wilson then all that is left is Twofold Bay and Eden, because Gladstone has already, I believe, been written off by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the people of Eden need to consider that Eden is still a very serious option. They do not need to make up their mind. There may well be two years for environmental impact statements. There may well be two years in which people have plenty of time for consultation and for sending the message to government about their views of the effect on important industries&mdash;and I include the timber, fishing and tourism industries which are based in the Eden, Pambula and Merimbula areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I mention those industries, I should mention that the viability of those industries is also very important not only to the local people in the area but also to the government. It is significant that the federal and state governments have now agreed to the setting aside of 55,000 hectares of forest to go into a national park so that the pristine wilderness areas in the south-east forests can be kept free of industry activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under that federal and state agreement, the viability of the industry is assured for a long time yet. If the sawmills in the area are prepared to put in funds, if they are prepared to invest, then the government has also got funds available for the restructuring which will occur as a result of the setting aside of those park areas with federal and state agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the important fishing industry, where important conservation measures are in place which are not easy for the industry. It is not easy for people who have been fishing for generation after generation to cope with the idea of conservation of species, many of which we are just learning about. It is interesting that in the Narooma area two people&mdash;Jim Dorling and Jim Grant&mdash;have set up genetic systems which are now being examined by government agencies and which would ensure the viability of the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if the wharf in Eden were completed, it might also be an outlet for our important wool industry. Until recently, the wool industry has been very much in the doldrums. About three weeks ago, prices started to move towards and above the 520c needed for the viability of the average farm, and that movement is very welcome for the average farm. We have China entering the market now, and the prospects for wool are much better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the beef industry also important in the region, I note that the United States has indicated that it is prepared to take an extra 80,000 tonnes of beef per year before its 31 per cent tariff applies. Korea and Japan are also going to buy more. So there are much better prospects for the beef industry. The dairy industry is showing itself to be very innovative in this region. In the production centres or processing works of the Moruya, Bega, Cooma, Bowral and Nowra areas, production is up 12.4 per cent&mdash;and it is all selling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in Cooma is also showing progress by selling overseas. It has always been a flag carrier for government. The government has now sold that organisation to the staff and they are selling overseas. They are getting business which, in the end, is helping the Cooma area. We also have the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, which is going to be an important link in the proposed national grid between Tasmania, South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. That national grid is going to mean cheaper electricity for people, as long as the states&mdash;and I particularly mention Victoria and New South Wales&mdash;cooperate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, New South Wales is taking an average of $300 off every business and household in tax, and is a little reluctant to agree to that national grid. That is an absolute disgrace, because it means that states which are prepared to cooperate are not able to sell their electricity at the best and cheapest prices; and it means that the consumer is paying more, and that we are not getting the national grid off the ground as quickly as we should. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority is prepared to take action to ensure that it is an important link, particularly between Victoria and New South Wales, in the development of that grid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of tourism, the government has had some innovative proposals for regional tourism. Already there are organisations particularly interested in taking advantage of ecotourism opportunities, and of important opportunities for cooperating together, to ensure that in the Snowy Mountains and on the south-east coast of New South Wales the opportunities are maximised. Recently there was an important move by the Shoalhaven Tourist Association to analyse tourist association surveys which have taken place. The analysis showed that 21 per cent of people who visit those areas visit them because they show an Australian way of life. We are now getting people coming from overseas who are more interested in seeing an Australian way of life than they are in visiting areas with high-rise flats and what one could call overdeveloped tourist facilities that only cater to people who are interested in looking at how movies are made. </PARA>

<PARA>The Prime Minister deserves censure because he is a leader whose unbounded arrogance has led to the ultimate weakness; that is, he has not got the guts to do what everyone in here and everyone out there knows should be done: to sack the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for misleading this parliament on three occasions and for being overwhelmingly incompetent, overwhelmingly negligent and politically corrupt with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This censure motion goes well beyond a situation where the Prime Minister is simply protecting a favoured mate or, as we say, a member of the royal family. The Prime Minister also deserves censure for three other main reasons: firstly, for refusing to require and enforce proper standards of ministerial performance, ministerial accountability and ministerial competence; secondly, because the Prime Minister himself has, in fact, misled this parliament; and, thirdly, because the Prime Minister has set out to demean and undermine the parliamentary processes, particularly by his changes to question time which have significantly weakened ministerial accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt that the government is taking water over the Kelly affair, over `Kellygate'; and there is absolutely no doubt that, as Ros Kelly sinks, she is taking others with her&mdash;the Prime Minister and other ministers that are involved on a daily basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also point out that you are now up to your armpits in the cover-up of what is a blatant exercise in political corruption. Mrs Kelly's problems, Prime Minister, are now your problems. As she drags you and other ministers down, Prime Minister, you are going to face very significant political consequences of your failure to act and your mishandling of this situation. This is very clearly an open-and-shut case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has been incompetent and she has misled this parliament. She must resign or she must be sacked. The minister is an embarrassment. She is an embarrassment to the government, she is an embarrassment to the parliament and she is an embarrassment to herself. We have censured her many times, we have asked her many questions, and every time she has tried to dig herself out of a hole she has dug a deeper political grave. She has got something of a reverse Midas touch: everything she touches turns to crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go through in some detail the three main reasons why the Prime Minister is to be censured today. Firstly, the Prime Minister has abandoned any pretence of ministerial standards&mdash;standards about competence, standards about accountability. The Prime Minister has abandoned any pretence to accept or enforce those standards. Just look at the activities of the minister in question. She has clearly abused the office to which she has been appointed. She has clearly abused the trust of the office that she holds. She has run a politically corrupt operation to try to buy votes in Labor marginal seats. She has created in effect an ALP slush fund using taxpayers' money with no proper standards, no documentation, no audit trail and no accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at the appalling way in which she has responded to our repeated questions and cross-examination on this issue. She started out by saying all the documents had been given to the Auditor-General. When that one did not carry water, she moved on to say, `I did it all in my head'. When that one did not carry water, she said she used a great big whiteboard. One attempt after another to obfuscate&mdash;never a clear-cut answer, never a direct answer, to any of the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just look at some of the appalling program mistakes that were made. She gave the Mount Gravatt Workers' Club $200,000&mdash;and the club did not even exist when the grant was made. What about when she went down to Bendigo and told the people to deal with the local member, who was the Labor Party candidate, as the person who would organise the funding? There was the eastern suburbs Maitland Cricket Club: the club had no ground and no development application had been lodged when she gave it $49,000. That was clear-cut gross incompetence. There is no alternative conclusion to draw&mdash;clear-cut gross incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed in this morning's press that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which has been looking into the sports rorts affair, is already starting to form its opinion on you. This is a very significant change, because this is a committee you stacked to try to minimise the damage. It is now coming to the view that it will question your ministerial competence. Why would it not, after the list of facts that I have just given you? It will also question your role and say that it was totally inadequate and deficient&mdash;as reported in today's press. There is a very clear message to you, Prime Minister, from your own stacked House of Representatives committee&mdash;Ros Kelly is finished; Ros Kelly has to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More important than her incompetence is the fact that she has misled this parliament on at least three occasions. The first occasion was when she said that all the documents had gone to the Auditor-General. We found a fax to the honourable member for Gellibrand (Mr Willis) which had not been included in those documents. Similarly, this week we referred to a minute from the Department of Finance in relation to the Altone Park project in Perth, and you would not confirm that that document had gone to the Auditor-General either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second time you misled the parliament was when you actually dropped the Prime Minister in the deep end. You might remember that back on 8 February you gave a clear-cut denial. You said, `I did not discuss the distribution of any specific grants with the Prime Minister'. This week, on 22 February, you said the Prime Minister was involved in the $1 million commitment to Altone Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third time the minister misled the parliament was in relation to the issue of eligibility. When she was before the House of Representatives committee on 9 February, she said, `If a project wasn't eligible then it wouldn't have been funded'. She repeated that in this parliament on 22 February. But later the same day she added to her answer and admitted that the department's ineligible project for the Pine Rivers youth band was actually made eligible by her. That is three separate occasions on which this minister has clearly misled the parliament. Any one of them is a hanging offence; all three of them are threefold hanging offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason the Prime Minister should be censured is that he himself has misled this parliament. He did this while mindlessly attempting to defend this incompetent minister. Back on 21 February, honourable members might remember, the Prime Minister was asked a direct question about the commitment made to Altone Park. He said, `I have no recollection of that issue, none whatsoever'. That is a Ronald Reagan memory if ever I have heard of one. Stephen Smith, your ex-staffer, had lobbied you for that grant. There is no way you could possibly have forgotten that. When Stephen Smith lobbies, people remember. I am sure the Prime Minister would have remembered that. Also, you personally authorised the $1 million&mdash;a convenient loss of memory at the very best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, also on 21 February, you stated categorically that all the minister's proposals&mdash;referring to the minister's proposals under this sports rorts program&mdash;were eligible ones. This was clearly wrong, as admitted by the minister the very next day in relation to the Pine Rivers youth band. She actually turned a grant that had been determined to be ineligible by her department into an eligible grant. Therefore, the Prime Minister clearly misled the House in saying that all her proposals were eligible. So, Prime Minister, I believe that in the circumstances where you have misled the House&mdash;and misled the House very directly&mdash;you have a very real problem. It highlights the problem; it does not solve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a situation back in 1975 when Gough Whitlam had a similar problem in relation to Rex Connor. You might remember the situation. Gough Whitlam had a better understanding of the significance of this parliament, and he was far more inclined to give this parliament its true place in Australian society&mdash;unlike the Prime Minister, who spends all his time trying to undermine and demean the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whitlam had a solution. He was honest enough to come into the parliament and say that the minister had misled him. I imagine that we are about to see the Prime Minister take the same escape route. Whitlam said that O`Connor had misled him in saying that all the documents had been made available. I am sure that, now we have demonstrated that this Prime Minister has clearly misled the House, he will use the same escape route. If he does not, he will continue to go on misleading this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final reason why the Prime Minister is to be censured today relates to the changes to the question time arrangements and other changes which demean and undermine the processes of this parliament. I focus particularly on the so-called `Ros-ter' system, obviously named after the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. It is a way of reducing&mdash;</PARA>

He would have us believe that he is not the arrogant person that we all think he is and that he is actually quite a kind, humble and vulnerable person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, it is almost about time I got some protection. One of the great political scandals of all time was the Watergate affair. We all remember the significance of the Watergate affair in the US political system. At the heart of that affair was a committee to re-elect the president, which was called CREEP. We have in Australia our own version of that CREEP&mdash;the committee to re-elect Paul, which was administered by the minister, the honourable member for Canberra, Ros Kelly, in the sports rorts program. I point out to you, Mr Speaker, that the two CREEPs&mdash;the Australian version and the American version&mdash;have a lot in common. I think probably most importantly both governments involved won their elections dishonestly; they capitalised on the circumstances and both won their elections dishonestly.</PARA></TALK.START>

He decided to draw a very unfortunate bow in terms of the debate and the censure motion before this House this day. On that occasion, the Prime Minister referred to the Rex Connor of old, the Rex Connor who resigned his ministry in particular circumstances. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was never any suggestion of impropriety on his part, not a bit, but he resigned his position because he gave conflicting advice to the Parliament. He was a man of honour. What honour is there here?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a good question. What honour is there here now when the Prime Minister some 12 years ago said that because misleading advice had been given to the parliament that minister should resign? Prime Minister, you made a weak case here today that somehow this minister had done nothing overly wrong. You said that she may have just misled the Auditor-General a little and may have just misled the parliament but there was no real corruption involved. The Leader of the House and Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) made the same point yesterday that on your own criteria&mdash;the criteria coming from your own quote in 1982&mdash;this minister should resign, resign now and resign quickly so that this sports rorts affair can be completely tidied up. </PARA>

Some of you might remember what the Leader of the House had to say yesterday with regard to a sort of hands-on Pontius Pilate role in relation to controlling and monitoring departmental expenditure beyond the Department of Finance. Well, some of us, including the shadow minister for finance, me and others, read with interest the annual report of the Department of Finance. I point out to the honourable member for Swan, the Minister for Finance, that his charter, mission statement and role are pretty well laid out on page 3 of this annual report, just in case he has not read it himself. You admitted yesterday that you are a new minister, so let me help you. In the annual report it states that the department's mission is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Serving Australia by promoting value for money in the management of the Commonwealth Public Sector through quality advice and service to clients.'</PARA>
<PARA>She is one of your clients in that context. It states further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The values important to discharging this Mission are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>please listen&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">high ethical standards, fairness, impartiality, accountability and mutual respect.</PARA>
<PARA>In case you have not seen it, that is the mission statement of your department. It goes on to detail the role of the Minister for Finance and the role of the Department of Finance. Again, in case you did not pick it up in the briefings you had with the Sir Humphrey equivalent when you took over the department, I will read it to you. Amongst other things, that role is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. evaluation and review of governmental programs and associated expenditure and staffing proposals&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is a fairly significant role&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. governmental financial administration and accounts, including administration of the Public Account;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. oversight of Commonwealth public sector financial management policy development . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Sports and recreation is right there in the middle of that role. To cap it all off, let me read what is on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department's responsibilities cover all facets of Commonwealth public sector resource allocation and management. Moreover, Finance is the principal source of financial analysis and advice on budget outlays.</PARA>
<PARA>In case you have not read it, minister, I will put it on the table. You tabled this two weeks ago. It might help you to come up to date with what your department's responsibilities are in relation to this sports rorts affair. They are very big responsibilities. This is another reason why you are accountable along with Ros Kelly and Paul Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an extraordinary duo we have in Keating and Kelly&mdash;of course I should refer to them as the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, and everything else, for a little while longer. One forgot to put in his tax return and the other forgot to put in returns for the expenditure of $30 million of taxpayers' funds. That is a pretty glaring duo effort, and one they should now pay the price for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition correctly spelled out in this debate, was the $30 million of the sports rorts affair equitably distributed? The answer is no. The Labor marginal seats received twice as much money as coalition marginal seats&mdash;and the poorer seats are not all held by Labor members. Many of the blue-collar suburbs of Australia are voting for the Liberal Party, as is clearly demonstrated in electorates such as Cowan and Stirling. A great effort was put in by those members to win those seats and they now carry out capable work on that sports committee. The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) and others proudly represent in this House many blue-collar workers. They and their electorates deserve a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question is: were departmental guidelines and recommendations adhered to? No. The Pine Rivers youth band is just one example of where they were not, because it was ineligible. Could the minister please start reading the statements before she reads the cover? That is where she went wrong a few days ago, on Monday. She stood up and gave a supplementary answer on Tuesday and, of course, she forgot to actually read what the department had fed up to her for that supplementary answer. As the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) correctly points out, buried in the middle of it was the ultimate clanger of all time: the admission that the Pine Rivers youth band was ineligible for a grant. The minister breached her own undertaking to the House and she misled the House in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is: was the matching funds requirement adhered to at every stage? The answer is no, in no way shape or form&mdash;I will not dwell on that. Simply, this comment relates to a whole raft of material the coalition has from right across Australia as far west as Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth question is: was any audit trail kept intact? The answer again is no. In no way shape or form did the minister keep an audit trail intact. That is why she must resign. That is why she is accountable to that ultimate court of law in terms of parliamentary democracy: the floor of the House of Representatives and the parliament of Australia. That is why she should read the message flowing from this debate, flowing from the Senate, flowing from an extraordinary committee report where even leaping Leo is prepared&mdash;</PARA>

What an extraordinary thing to do to spend a couple of minutes on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in which he was trying to raise issues to censure the Prime Minister, he threw into the middle of it the failure to adequately protect Prince Charles during his last visit to Australia. He went through a whole series of other suggestions which were absolutely unrelated to the issues at hand. It was a weak speech, followed by an even weaker one, and the last thing that the opposition wanted was to actually have an opportunity presented to any member on this side of the House to give an answer to it. It was a deliberate effort to prevent a discussion in this place by an opposition which has made an art form of endless chanting and disruption during question time and which then goes to the point where a censure motion is moved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But to debate a censure motion in that fashion is absolutely absurd. I must say that, for those of us on this side of the House, there has been some chagrin in having to debate these matters, particularly with the honourable member for Bennelong. He has gone around the country in a state of extreme unction discussing what are appropriate levels of ministerial propriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong places a program which has been in existence for six years, which has been before Senate estimates committees for six years and which has had opportunities for public and parliamentary scrutiny for six years with his own performance as Treasurer when for six years, or thereabouts, he presided over the greatest defrauding of the taxation system. Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost at the bottom of the harbour&mdash;half the Liberal Party finance committee in Western Australia actively engaged in the process. No doubt at the time he would have said, `Because this involves no personal corruption or fraud on my part, I ought to survive'. No doubt from time to time he had to discuss these issues with his Prime Minister of the day, presiding as he was over the greatest scandal in public life. It is certainly the greatest in the time that I have been a member of parliament. He paid no penalty for that, except subsequent election to the Liberal Party leadership. I take just one quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Far from the picture presented by Treasurer Mr Howard of a tax office which did not tell him enough of what was going on in 1978 and 1979&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we remember those calls&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the record shows a continual flow of information from Mr O'Reilly to Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA>Billy Hughes is dead, but you are not yet. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At several stages Mr O'Reilly wrote to Mr Howard saying the problem was assuming more urgency. Would he write to Senator Durack to get some response?</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on with this instance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A week later he was writing to Mr Howard again trying to head off cabinet doubts and warning that if action was not taken the whole range of government anti-avoidance activity would be of no avail. The same day he wrote again saying the changes cabinet wanted could be accommodated in legislation put before parliament that year.</PARA>
<PARA>The point of raising this is to get some degree of perspective on the issues that we are discussing here today. If ever there was an issue on which everybody has lost their perspective it is this one. The Auditor-General did a study of this particular program and said that he could find no evidence of fraud, he could find no evidence of political bias and he could find nothing that would normally cause him to issue for censure, but he was unsatisfied with the recording of materials so that he could make a judgment on these matters. What was revealed in that process was a set of administrative procedures which he determined were unsatisfactory and which the minister subsequently agreed with him were unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was expenditure not on a program that had to do with hundreds of millions of dollars. When the business community failed to bear that Malcolm Fraser actually introduced a petrol tax to cover it. That hole in the revenue was filled by a petrol tax on every Australian. That hole in the revenue from the business community, the Liberal Party's mates, was why that petrol taxation arrangement started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot compare and contrast that set of events, which produced no ministerial resignation, no discussions of ministerial propriety but a program absolutely rampant with fraud, with this. Of course we all know that at the time one of the advisers to the honourable member for Bennelong was the current Leader of the Opposition. We have that situation contrasted with what was admitted by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to be quite clearly a set of unsatisfactory administrative procedures which could be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then go to the actual program itself. There were two elements of the actual program. The first was a process in the department which classified grants into four divisions, starting with ones that seemed most acceptable under the criteria and going through to those that were not. The other, incorporated in the guidelines of that program, was substantial ministerial discretion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not unusual to that program. Many programs have substantial ministerial discretion. So, when guidelines are established, the program gets under way and there are anomalies or people who fall outside the guidelines, there is an opportunity for a minister to intervene and put his or her own judgment upon it. It is not unique to this program; it is a common feature of just about every government program you care to name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations that came through from the department produced these results: in the first category of those most acceptable, the minister approved of 55 per cent; in those in the category that were next, 28 per cent; in the one after that, 19 per cent; and in the one after that a few made it through&mdash;and that is it. One ought to think that a program which had both ministerial discretion and an appropriate set of offerings from the department on what conformed with the guidelines would, in any normal circumstances, produce an outcome very like that. That is the sort of result you would see from that program. That is, in fact, all that has resulted from that program. So it is not particularly surprising, sitting down and looking at those particular outcomes, that the Auditor-General came to those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there were the questions of whether or not these programs were likely to produce a situation where fraud became endemic in one way or another to them. Then we have on them the two checks in that process. The first of those checks was the requirement upon a particular committee associated with a club or whatever that was applying for those grants to make a contribution itself, or sometimes a local authority, or sometimes a state government. That was one check. The second check was that, unless the program moneys were spent on the purposes, money would not be paid across. Those are both pretty strong checks on any program. `If you don't build it, you don't get it'&mdash;that was the second check. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast the administration of that program again with that which the honourable member for Bennelong presided over when he was there. Would you say that there was comparability between the two? Would you say that the propositions that those opposite had engaged in on their side of the House were better or worse than an outcome based on that set of operations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministerial discretion is important here because, when you got through that 20-minute puerile speech from the Leader of the Opposition, the ground at the end of the day on why he said that the Prime Minister ought to be censured for maintaining the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was that in a couple of answers she had misled the House and she gave the Pine River band $11,000. What happened there? A note went from the department to the Pine River band&mdash;$11,000 for instruments&mdash;saying, `Look, we don't think that you fit into the criteria but, if you feel you've got a case, approach the minister'. The department advised the Pine River band, `Approach the minister'. In other words, `Invite the minister to exercise her ministerial discretion on your behalf', which she subsequently did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is particularly wrong with that? Why is that misleading the House? Why is that such a devastating problem in a program whose criteria were established and publicly known, so that you were able to make judgments upon them? For that she is supposed to be censured by the House. The $11,000 Pine River band instruments bid did not fit into the criteria because it was not a building. But, if you are talking about a program related to capital programs, what is a capital program for a band? A capital program for a band is instruments. All right, so it does not meet the criteria because it is not a building, but the department clearly thinks that that is a pretty good ground for giving a grant under these propositions. So what does the department do? It writes to the Pine River band and tells it to appeal to the minister. There is nothing more commonsense than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite then go to another issue: in one or two of these instances they have found that it was not the case that the particular club or community group concerned was obliged to raise dollar for dollar for the particular programs they entered into. Again, if you look at the criteria for the programs, you will see that there is a capacity upon the minister to make a variation in that regard as well. That is the second big misleading of the House that the minister is supposed to have engaged in&mdash;the fact that there are one or two programs which, given the criteria of the program, she is allowed to exercise independence on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They come rocking into this place&mdash;`Let's have her head! Let's have her head for a grant to the Bundaberg Netball Association because the Bundaberg Netball Association failed to come forward with a dollar for dollar contribution to the program'. What a pathetic crew. They proposed the total haemorrhaging and collapse of the taxation system, combined with imposing a massive petrol tax upon the ordinary Australian to pay for it and to keep Johnny Howard's balanced books. We had no removal of him during that. It was all good solid support for the old Johnny Howard when he was under threat and under attack from the then honourable member for Fremantle and others at the time. Were they calling for Johnny Howard's resignation for misleading the House when he kept getting up in this place saying, `I am not aware of these things that are coming to me', despite the fact that he was getting a weekly letter from the Commissioner of Taxation telling him? Oh no, there was no misleading of the House. Tax evasion? Minor issue. No worries about that. What we will have is the head of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories because of 11 grand to the Pine River band&mdash;`She misled the House with 11 grand to the Pine River Band!'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is puerile. It was an extraordinarily puerile speech from the second speaker. You disrupted the prime ministerial reply because you concealed the puerility of your speech. You are not worthy of further debate on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before this debate was adjourned for question time I was talking about some of the regional tourism strategies that have been developed and particularly how they will benefit the south-east region of New South Wales and the ACT. I might also mention some other great benefits that have occurred from government policy. Two or three nights ago, I unveiled a plaque at the Eden swimming pool. Honourable members would never have guessed that the extension to the swimming pool was built with funds provided by the sporting grants. I will just briefly mention those grants because they were an important part of the appropriations in previous budgets. I strongly support the moves made by the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) within the government party to continue those sporting grants. They have benefited a number of towns&mdash;Eden, Narooma, Bungendore and Cooma. These towns have taken advantage of the grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points about issues that were raised by honourable members opposite&mdash;that these grants were not allocated on the basis of issues such as equity and fairness. A number of honourable members raised the fact that in their electorates there was a greater proportion of poor people. When one looks at the electorates, certainly from an income point of view, their electorates do show a lower average income. If I look at my own electorate, for instance, the people of Queanbeyan have a much higher average income than the people of Bombala, which is a rural area. But on the other hand&mdash;the ABS statistics do not show this&mdash;if we were able to look at the comparative assets of the areas then we would find that the people in Bombala have a higher level of assets on average than the people in Queanbeyan. When we look at the two areas we find more poverty in Queanbeyan. That does not mean that Bombala is a wealthy area nor does it mean that it should not be eligible for grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fallacious for honourable members such as the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford), the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) to talk about their electorates as if they were the poorest. They may be the poorest in income, but certainly they are not the poorest by any means in assets. In fact, when I go around the electorate of Eden-Monaro the only complaints I hear about the sporting grants are from people that did not get them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I got far less allocation, for instance, than the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) did, and I am supposed to hold a marginal Labor seat. I got less than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I got less than the Treasurer (Mr Willis), who does not have a marginal Labor seat. So I do not believe for one minute that the allocation was on the basis of marginality; I believe it was substantially on the basis of need. The only criticism that I have, and it is the same as the criticism of the Auditor-General, is that records should have been kept. I felt that the way grants were allocated on previous occasions, where priorities were given and honourable members were allowed to comment, was a good basis. Certainly, I go no further than the Auditor-General, in fact I would agree with him that there is no evidence of political bias and no evidence of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of employment, which is another important issue: there have been calls, especially from some of the social service organisations and from this side of the House, that the government ought to consider a jobs levy to solve the unemployment problem, particularly the problem of long-term unemployment. Rather than do that, we ought to learn a lesson from what happened in December when there were substantial income tax cuts for a number of people, and confidence in the community started to turn in favour of a growth economy. People started to believe that the economy was growing because there was more money to spend on the needs that people had had for sometime. They found they had more money. I believe that the tax incentives from lower taxation had a dramatic effect on the economy, on consumer confidence and on business confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to look at tax incentives rather than at a jobs levy, as the tax incentives are associated with the recovery that has already happened. For instance, the Department of Employment, Education and Training has its task force on management in Australia. We have had some micro-economic reforms in so far as workers are concerned, getting more productivity. So let us now look at management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the department has a task force on management. The best of our managers are equivalent to the best in the world but the standard does drop somewhat, particularly in small business. I have tried to refer people to business enterprise centres in New South Wales&mdash;I congratulate the New South Wales government on the formation of those centres&mdash;but very often those people feel that they have nothing to learn. They say they know their trade pretty well and very often they do know their trade pretty well, but that does not always mean that they are good managers; nor does it mean that they are able to do the cash flows and look at the productivity of their enterprise in the way they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to develop an attitude to improve productivity. I believe we should start at school. A lot of people in small business are underemployed. I was in small business for 25 years and a lot of them are underemployed. If we are looking at productivity we ought to be looking at what is happening in small business. I look forward to the report from that task force on management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend a project, by Peter Morris of the south coast Business Enterprise Centre, on venture finance. He suggested that venture finance be provided to businesses by providing tax incentives to private enterprise to encourage them to invest in venture finance. I hope to talk on this at a later time, but I commend him for his suggestion which has gone to Treasury. I think it is a great suggestion. I also commend the Jones committee on long-term strategies, which is looking at alternatives. I believe we should look at tax incentives to encourage employment in areas where there are not high levels of employment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doling out public funds as political patronage is bad enough. But from a political perspective, it was not as bad as being caught. Your actions were naive in the extreme and contemptuous of convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unsuccessfully. But it did not stop the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) from saying what she did to representatives of the Bendigo Regional Recreation Board when they went to see her about an indoor swimming centre project. This indoor swimming centre had the support of the municipalities in Bendigo and the YMCA, and the Victorian state government had allocated $500,000 to the project. It had the broad support of all of the people in Bendigo; they wanted this indoor swimming centre. I gave it my absolute and utmost support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the minister came to Bendigo and met the Bendigo Regional Recreation Board on 4 March 1993 and told it that the Labor candidate, Mr Helper, was the person to see to obtain funds for the indoor swimming centre. Have you ever heard anything like that? It is an absolute disgrace. It is shameful. The advice to the Bendigo Regional Recreation Board was that the project met the criteria. We have already had evidence from the minister's own mouth that some of the projects that were funded were ineligible and did not meet the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a project that was supported by everyone in the Bendigo community, yet because of political interference and bias people were told by the minister to go and talk to Mr Helper, the Labor candidate, because he was the person to see. Not only do we have the minister saying it; we also have a statement in an editorial today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bendigo Advertiser</EMPHASIS> that in fact&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no maybes; but in fact&mdash;the local Labor candidate at the time let it be known that organisations wanting sports grants should have gone through him rather than through the sitting member. There we have it, from both sides of the equation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister probably gave the candidate the instructions to go out and tell people in sporting organisations: `You go and tell them that, if they do not deal through you, you will not get any money'. That is the sort of caper that they have been up to&mdash;political bias and collusion between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the minister and corruption of the electoral system. That is what we are talking about. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Prime Minister went to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and said, `Here is $30 million.

The Prime Minister was giving $30 million to this program and saying, `Go out and buy me an election win'. That is what it was all about. Then the minister had the gall to go to ALP candidates and tell them to tell the sporting organisations that they must deal through the ALP candidates. It is absolute corruption of our electoral system to use a program in that way. There was collusion between the ALP candidates trying to win marginal seats held by me and by the honourable member for Ballarat. I might add that we were not the only ones; there were others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently had correspondence and inquiry from the town of St Arnaud. The St Arnaud Council put an excellent submission to me. It fitted right into the environment, sport and territories portfolio. The project the town put up for funding was going to take care of an environmental problem and provide water resources to a golf course. Do honourable members think that would get up?  I would have thought it had a pretty good show. In fact, the minister wrote back to me and thanked me for indicating my support for this project: `I will bear it in mind when I consider the allocation of funds under the program'. That is what she told me. What the project was doing was taking sewage effluent, treating it and then relaying that water onto a golf course. So it would have fixed two problems: it would have fixed an environment problem in the township of St Arnaud and it would have also provided much needed water resources to this golf course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It put in an excellent submission. It was one that I supported. It was looking for $223,500, so it met the criteria of the program. The sum of $250,000 was the maximum amount that one could get. It had the support of the St Arnaud Golf Club. It had the support of the town of St Arnaud. It had the support of the neighbouring municipalities. What they were doing was seeking money for an environment and sport issue that fitted into two of the areas that this minister is responsible for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They could have recycled that sewage water. It could have been spread on the golf course and St Arnaud would have had a magnificent golf course. The honourable member for Ballarat and I would have been pleased to have played at their opening. But, no, the minister did not see any value in that at all, because she was too busy looking at the marginal ALP seats and looking after the people on that side who all had their snouts in the trough and all had their handouts. She was looking at the Mackerras pendulum, ticking them all off as she went through the programs and saying, `Here's one. He needs a bit of help'.

It not only dealt with a serious environmental problem but it also was to the advantage of a sporting organisation. I would have thought that would have been right up the top of the list. But, regrettably no, it was not, and the minister funded other programs. I think the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Lavarch) had a program funded which was quite clearly ineligible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program was probably based on some fairly sound principles. It was one way of getting some money into sporting organisations. But the Auditor-General and the parliamentary committee have already found that the minister was deficient in her administration and kept no records except the whiteboard. What way is this for a government to run a program of that size? She was carrying around 2,800 applications. Is that why my golf course fell off the whiteboard? Did it simply get rubbed off the board before it got proper consideration or did she look at the Mackerras electoral pendulum and say, `No, that can't be funded. It is not a seat that we can put some money into'. It is absolutely blatant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister has been right up to his neck in this. There is no doubt that he has been in collusion with the minister over the allocation and application of these funds for that program. It all went to ALP seats. It went to marginal seats where the ALP thought it could win the seats away from Liberal sitting members or National Party sitting members. We have already had evidence of that from members of the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that the program was quite badly administered. No records were kept. Ineligible applications were funded. Projects that did not meet the criteria in any shape or form were funded by the minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways for us to get on top of some of these problems, and I want to discuss these today. What can we do about this situation? Schools are still turning out people who are illiterate and who have numeracy problems, and we need to turn that around. The young people coming out of schools today with these difficulties are at risk of becoming the next prison population. The highest level of illiteracy in any population group in Australia today is in the prison population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody condones the breaking of laws, but anybody who has taken the time to get involved in assisting prison groups would know that there is always a reason for people being in prison. It often comes down to frustrations associated with unemployment, low self-esteem, lack of money, lack of family support or the inability to express oneself. There is a link between illiteracy and prison, and we should accept that and society should come to grips with it. These days young people are most likely to be unable to cope with the pressures of being illiterate. Having no education can result in people ending up in prison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to allocate money and resources in areas which will address this problem. Let us look at the figures. The average cost of keeping somebody in prison for one year is $45,000. There are also costs involved prior to the person being convicted, such as the costs of police, the court, social welfare, vandalism and health. The cost of keeping a child at primary school for one year is $3,500. That is pretty efficient for most state bureaucracies today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How does this relate to tackling the problem of illiteracy? If we could put money into improving basic education, literacy and numeracy difficulties of children at preschool, we would overcome many of the problems associated with people in prison. We should also continue to endeavour to lift the lot of those in prison with difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference in the cost of education of a primary school student and a secondary school student is $1,596 a year. That figure comes from the report of the national schools program, which was tabled in the parliament a couple of weeks ago. There is a critical need to close the gap with respect to cost between the primary education level and the secondary education level. If we achieve that in the next few years, then in 10 or 15 years time we will have cut down the prison population of Australia. But in order to take advantage of that great opportunity, we will need to provide our education system with not only money but also resources. We can decrease the illiteracy rate of prison populations in 10 or 15 years time if we are determined to put in the effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those people in society who argue for more police, heavier penalties and longer terms in gaol for people who break laws should also be lobbying for more resources for our primary school system. If we target that system, we will end up keeping people out of prison. If we put money even into preschools, we will start to overcome some children's difficulties. If we can help the children in the school systems who are at risk, we will end up keeping people out of prison. We need to focus on that point and we need to make sure that the government does too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some schools operating today are taking a much more positive view of illiteracy and they are looking at it in a different way. They are endeavouring to come to grips with the problem. Some isolated schools are trying to help their children under great difficulty. We need to give them assistance. We also need to give assistance to our teachers, particularly our new teachers, who need to be trained to understand the direction that they should go in. As the state education departments are cutting back on teaching numbers, there are fewer teachers in our school system, which causes difficulties such as increased numbers of students per class. They are also cutting back on resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the cost of education at primary schools is $1,500 less than that at secondary schools, and this should be looked at. Most of the teachers at secondary schools are female, and many of them are younger females. They have little clout in the overall politics of education departments and they probably have little clout within their union to raise the issues of educational needs. So we have a section within our education system which is neglected and which needs assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need to act in the area of early childhood support. The government has set up a review, following the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>. The government will need to act on some of the recommendations resulting from that review. The government will need to have ministers who will take up the challenge to pursue that and it will also need a cabinet to give it support. I believe the government will need to get the states and the territories on side in order to pursue new policies and new ideas in this field. I believe that, by starting a program, we could eliminate illiteracy from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago the world took on the elimination of smallpox from the world. Through the World Health Organisation smallpox was eliminated. That was a great achievement. I am sure thousands of people dedicated themselves to achieving that goal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formative years of young people&mdash;between grades 2 and 3&mdash;are critical. More and more evidence is coming forward to show that during and prior to these years children are at risk of not getting the basic skills and understanding of numeracy and literacy which they need. So it is this age group that we must focus on and which the government must focus on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe it is just the federal government that needs to focus on this need. We have to make sure that every state and territory education department focuses on this need also and that their ministers are aware of the difficulties and tackle them in a positive way. They need to say, `This is a problem and we are going to tackle it'. Let us all put education for young people first. Let us change the prison population in 10 to 15 years by putting resources into education. Let us make sure that our children can read and write before they leave primary school. Later is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with an issue that many members of the House have raised during this debate and that is the issue of the family. I have been a little concerned that those opposite have endeavoured to define the family. I think it is very difficult for this parliament or any political party to come up with a definition of what is right or what is good as a family. Modern society is very diverse. I know of lots of different sorts of families. In the broader sense, a family consists of people who support each other in day-to-day life. That is very important and I would have thought that that is what being a family is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People from dysfunctional families and people who do not belong to a family structure or support group are the ones that have the most difficulties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about the family we also need to talk about support for people who may not have traditional families. We need to continue to give support, which has been considerably lacking in the past, to homeless youths. I also believe that we should be positive about the family and family life whether it is traditional or not. I would define the family more broadly than those opposite. They seem to cling to the idea that Australian society is made up of families of mum and dad and two kids. Our statistics show us that that is not so and that our society is much broader. I rebut the idea of some of those opposite who blame this government for somehow changing the family. I do not believe that is true. I believe our society changes and governments have to come to grips with those changes and support those people who need it as a result of those changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available I would like to refer to a greater problem than that of the Kelly affair in this parliament, and that is the waterfront strike in Sydney. Some 55 personnel are holding up the whole waterfront of Australia&mdash;every port around the country&mdash;because of an industrial dispute. Whilst we are excited to know that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) will be resigning some time in the future, I think all Australians are very concerned that the exporters, the miners and the farmers have been affected by the activities of one stevedoring union, the maritime union in Sydney, which has seen fit to renege on an agreement that was signed some 18 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the waterfront has been a major difficulty to exporters and all Australians over the last 25 years, it is fair to say that a lot of progress has been made on the waterfront because of mechanisation, changes in attitudes and, more particularly, reductions in the number of personnel. In 1985-86 there were 8,000 waterside workers around Australia in the various ports. In 1992-93 there are about 4,000 waterside workers conducting the same amount of activity and obviously doing it a lot better with the aid of modern mechanical equipment, containerisation and cranes. The bulk commodity area has historically worked very well apart from the intransigence of the unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a bit of progress in this regard. This government has even made a little bit of progress although it is not as much as the ministers would have us believe. We have this very unfortunate and, in my view, critical situation with the monopoly by the stevedores in the Maritime Union of Australia, as it is called; it is no longer the wharfies union. They have a more respectable name but obviously they have maintained the same attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamentally, the dispute revolves around the redundancy of 55 waterside workers who are part of a union, who entered into an enterprise agreement under which the job for life attitude that has been endemic on the waterfront would be removed and those waterfront workers who were no longer required could be declared redundant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I clearly indicate to the House that on 28 March 1994 the Brereton industrial relations proposals will come into effect. What the government and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) would have us believe is that enterprise agreements under these new industrial relations arrangements will be of a first-class nature. But the reality is that the enterprise agreements are between the management of any particular company or firm and the union involved. In this case, with a long tradition of union domination and union monopoly on the waterfront, these enterprise agreements are between the union and National Terminals (Australia), which is a stevedoring company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point I wish to make is that industrial relations in Australia will change after 28 March. If the minister does not bring forward the proclamation of the new industrial relations, when these laws come into effect it will be more difficult to put personnel off. I think that is very clear; greater procedures will have to be undertaken to remove people from the work force. In light of these events, 55 people at Sydney have seen fit to hold up what is going on and renege on an agreement that was entered into in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 November 1992, National Terminals entered into an agreement with the Maritime Union in good faith. It resulted in long discussions with the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, WIRA, which is well known to members of this House and people associated with the waterfront. Of course, all honourable members of the House would be aware that employment on the waterfront was for life&mdash;having a brother, father or a son on the waterfront was the only way to enter that particular mode of employment and once a person got the job he would be there forever no matter what his performance was like. In addressing the issue of employment security&mdash;nice words for jobs for life&mdash;WIRA, in its final report dated October 1992, made this suggestion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commitments to employment security contained in Clause 8 were honoured during the period of the IPA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the interim arrangements&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Review discussions the Parties agreed that Future Employment Arrangements including employment security are matters for negotiation between individual employers and unions.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, everyone had agreed that there was scope for negotiation to solve this problem of there being too many people on the waterfront. Whilst there had been great strides in reducing personnel numbers from 8,000 to 4,000, it was obvious a few more should go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that report, Australian Stevedores entered into a retirement and redundancy agreement effective from 1 November 1992. It was signed by John Coombs on behalf of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, which has since merged into the Maritime Union of Australia. That agreement was signed and both sides understood the impact of the arrangements&mdash;that this very touchy subject of redundancy and reducing the work force would be addressed in a negotiating style and that both parties would hopefully benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section (f) of that agreement, a company has the right to declare a redundancy situation and to call for volunteers from the employees. The agreement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that sufficient volunteers are not forthcoming as a result of the application of the above procedures, the Company, the Unions and employees shall confer prior to the Company commencing required retrenchments.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear what was agreed to. I think arrangements were reached after extensive negotiation. It is worth noting that during this period the company sought volunteers, paying more than $22 million to 282 volunteers. That is almost $100,000 per man. That has been the sort of payout, depending on the entitlements, made to the waterfront volunteers involved. They have come out of it very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that background and given the spirit of the stevedoring company, one would have thought that the union could have negotiated a further arrangement. But that was not to be the case. The 55 members of the union maintained their position and they said that they wanted to have their jobs back at any price. It is worth noting that ports around the rest of Australia, as I understand it, have agreed to these terms and conditions, have negotiated contracts and have agreed to changes in work practices&mdash;which is essential to the outcome of improving waterfront efficiency. These changes include using updated equipment and generally improving output to try to make Australia, as an exporting nation, somewhere near world standards in terms of moving containers quickly, getting a quicker turnaround of vessels and generally cleaning up our waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of one particular group of the Maritime Union are now saying that they will renege on an agreement which was signed by their secretary and agreed to by everyone, and</PARA>
<PARA>that they are going hold up the whole of Australia. I think this is a total disaster for the Australian economy and for the waterfront in particular. It means that we are seeing a test run of the sort of problem that I predict will happen under the new so-called enterprise agreements put forward by Minister Brereton. When the real pressure comes on in relation to redundancies and sacking people because of changed circumstances under the new arrangements it is going to be much more difficult. We are seeing a bit of a test run on the waterfront, where it was agreed to make these changes, to gradually reduce the work force and to allow a more productive arrangement. With only two stevedoring companies and one union on the waterfront now, there is still a lack of competition, in a genuine sense, between the stevedoring companies and the monopoly position of the union members themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have been advocating that genuine enterprise agreements be instituted. That is what we advocated at the last election and we have not moved away from that position one bit. We believe that the real malaise on the Australian waterfront has been this lack of a genuine enterprise agreement between the management&mdash;in this case, Stevedores&mdash;and the waterfront workers. We have fundamentally agreed to this position. We have advocated it and the government has, after a lot of discussion, held a number of inquiries&mdash;I understand there have been 20 inquiries into the waterfront since the 1930s&mdash;trying to overcome this problem of permanency of tenure and, of course, the waterfront practices which are legend in the Australian work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my concern on behalf of the farmers, the exporters and the importers that a union of 55 personnel could hold up the whole Australian waterfront at a cost of millions of dollars per day, particularly in Sydney, by reneging on a contract that had been agreed to. I would hope there would be some sense of responsibility. I understand that today there is great bitterness at the waterfront, that pickets are being held strongly and that the men are concerned about the arguments. I place on record my concern on behalf of a number of my constituents and the exporters that such a small number of people would renege on a very important agreement after five to eight to years of discussion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee) recently announced a $1 million boost to backpacker tourism. This is a welcome initiative to this industry, which is worth about $1.5 billion to the Australian economy. In November last year I raised the issue that backpackers to this country have a right to expect proper conditions and standards of fire safety in accommodation and that in a significant number of cases they are not getting it. I pointed out that state governments and local councils have allowed too many defective establishments to continue trading. Not only is this putting people's lives at risk; it is giving the industry a bad name and damaging Australia's tourist reputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time I have received support from the New South Wales Backpacker Operators Association, individual operators and a number of individuals who have been subject to the appalling conditions in some of the hostels. There has been an angry response from a number of authorities who seem more interested in defending their pride than addressing the fire problems that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been subject to what I regard as a campaign of intimidation by the owners of at least two hostels with defective fire standards. That campaign has consisted so far of a major article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper character assassinating me, a writ for defamation&mdash;but not to the media outlet on which the supposed defamatory remarks were broadcast&mdash;and a political campaign through North Sydney Council. The writ is designed to buy time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this campaign is obviously to avoid spending some hundreds of thousands of dollars on fire protection. It now turns out that one of these hostels at 41 Cremorne Road in my electorate has been for sale for some time for $3.5 million. Every effort has obviously been made to sell before proper fire orders are issued. A tame North Sydney Council has aided and abetted this by delay and by largely ignoring the recommendations of the New South Wales Fire Brigade. The brigade specifically warned the council that deletion of any of its recommendations could prove detrimental to the overall fire safety of the buildings. Yet the council has watered this down on the pretext that the building is not a backpackers hostel but houses 90 low-income North Sydney residents, ignoring evidence to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the council should be severely censured for incompetence at best, and exposing its ratepayers to the risk of massive insurance claims, particularly with North Sydney's history of a death in the same area from fire some years ago as well as the tragic Luna Park fire. While social and economic factors must be considered in applying fire regulations to existing buildings, there is no case for compromising public safety in tourist facilities. Alternative accommodation is readily available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was a classic piece of intimidatory character assassination and a defence of backpacker accommodation at the Excelsior Hotel in Sydney. I thought it unusual at the time that a national newspaper would bother with such a subject, until it was revealed that the ownership of the hotel was the same as that of the hostel at Cremorne. While I do not believe the journalist P. P. McGuinness was acting on behalf of the owners' commercial interests, the effect was the same and I believe interests associated with the hotel approached him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a 30-year history of very direct involvement in the problem of building fire safety. To be accused of cowardice, ratbaggery, hypocrisy, lack of integrity and irresponsibility by a national newspaper for raising the serious issue of inadequate fire standards in tourist accommodation is a misuse of the power of the press, especially when such intimidation happens to be of financial assistance to the owners trying to avoid fire regulations. These regulations may be unduly onerous in the newspaper's view, but they are the law and must be applied equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I have a record of responsible use of parliamentary privilege over the last 12 years. I have not named any of the owners of backpacker hostels and I do not do so now. The issue is public safety and the slowness and lack of enforcement by the responsible authorities. State fire authorities must ensure that proper fire standards are implemented. In New South Wales there needs to be a revision of administrative procedures. The split responsibility between state and local authorities is not working. This issue will become even more important with the influx of tourists for the Olympic Games. </PARA>

The first matter concerned articles in several newspapers this morning which referred to a draft report of the committee and which, the honourable member said, purported to reveal conclusions reached by the committee. The honourable member said that the committee had considered these matters at length at a meeting this morning and had concluded that the publication of the material had caused substantial interference with the work of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to some comments made in this place yesterday by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) on both a speech I made in the House yesterday and a paper that I have circulated very recently regarding industry policy. I want to reassure the honourable member that I have not deviated from the true path as far as he thinks and also disagree with him on a couple of points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member suggested in his speech, which I read subsequently, that the Australian textile, clothing and footwear industry is as efficient as similar organisations in the rest of the OECD. Surprisingly enough, the honourable member quoted a study by John Matthews and Linda Weiss elsewhere in his speech which clearly indicates that that is not the case and gives fairly substantial evidence as to why the textile industry in Australia is struggling. So I disagree with him on that point. I suggest to the honourable member that there is little future in this country for certain types of manufacturing in that industry, particularly those focusing on long runs with low quality and competing on low costs, but there is considerable potential in many areas of the industry and that potential is starting to be realised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of my family in the Brunswick area were involved in the clothing industry for almost 100 years up until about three years ago. The type of clothing that they were involved with was essentially low quality, high production run items. Effectively, the factory that they worked in ended up closing essentially because of the nature of the product that they were producing. There is very little future for Australia producing that type of product, irrespective of things like tariff walls, government assistance and the like, but there is a considerable future in other areas of clothing manufacture as an example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what the honourable member for Wills said, I do not agree with the notion that competitive advantage is effectively a fairly static concept. He criticised me in his speech for suggesting that I almost seem to be accepting the neo-classical position on this issue. I specifically criticised the neo-classical economists on that issue from precisely the same standpoint of the honourable member for Wills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer him to my paper where I pointed out a fairly striking performance on the part of the World Bank, which has historically been dominated by people who take the neo-classical view. The World Bank in 1987 described the South Korean steel industry as arguably the most efficient steel producer in the world, yet in the early 1970s the same World Bank had refused loans to South Korea for steel production on the basis that South Korea had no competitive advantage in steel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also say to the honourable member for Wills that I did not, in his terms, cast a shadow over interventionism. I want sophisticated intervention into economic activity. I was arguing against some of the more crude forms of interventionist proposals that historically have come from, amongst other sections of the political spectrum, the Left in this country. Therefore, I agree with him that sectoral policy is significant. I did not, as he suggests, support the notion of international competitiveness without sectoral policy. I support sectoral policy, but the question is: what sectoral policy? What is the policy going to be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member seems to have some problems with my reference to the Left being instinctively interventionist. I was simply describing what I see to be fact: that the Left position has always been interventionist and that there is now something of a theoretical problem in the left because of internationalisation. Our interventionism has essentially been based on assumptions about Australia's ability to control economic activity within its borders that are no longer totally correct because of the internationalisation of economic activity across the globe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I make is that the references I have made to issues such as import replacement and government purchasing have perhaps been not fully understood by the honourable member for Wills, although I would accept that there is still disagreement between us on these issues. My basic position on these issues is that an indiscriminate approach in areas like that is of no great benefit to the Australian economy and may in fact be harmful whereas a discriminating and targeted approach can be of considerable value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a particular industry sector which either is internationally competitive or has reasonable prospects of being internationally competitive, then underpinning an industry strategy in that area with particular forms of import replacement or government purchasing mechanisms is of considerable value. The key questions are: what imports are we going to replace and what products is the government going to purchase? I therefore reject an indiscriminate strategy in those areas, not the use of those techniques. I am suggesting that they could be used in a much more sophisticated way as part of broader interventionist industry policy strategies. There have been examples such as the purchase of software by the Taxation Office, which occurred only as a result of industrial action being taken by the PSU. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom McLean was born in the Rockhampton region at Mount Morgan in 1901. It is interesting to know that the area of Rockhampton, along with Mount Morgan, Yeppoon and Emu Park, has provided probably more of the real pioneering and building spirit, particularly in Queensland, than any other part of Australia. He was born at the mine site at Mount Morgan and his parents then went on to a farm near Yeppoon. The point I make is that he was `born' into Mount Morgan, and Mount Morgan is itself a centre of great history for BP. That was the company that took money away from Saudi Arabia and put it into the goldmine in Queensland. BP is known as the quiet achiever and that could also describe Tom McLean in certain ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom left the area of Rockhampton and came to the Mackay district. He knew what the difficulties of living were. He went through an economic depression and all of this, I believe, made him attuned to what people were really looking for and really wanted. He did not have the opportunity of an education, but I dare say that he had more commonsense, more nous, more business sense and more practicality built into his one body than the whole of this parliament with all of its academia. He was a simple person from a great generation of people who built this nation of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said at his service that he was too young for the First World War and too old for the Second World War but that did not stop him participating. In fact, he joined the army. Only Tom would know the reasons he joined the army and later on he probably used those experiences to get money out of reluctant bankers and people like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during his service in New Guinea that he found his love for the sea and boats. In fact, at anchor in Port Moresby at the time he was working there was the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shangri La</EMPHASIS>, a vessel used by Douglas MacArthur on his return to the Philippines. Tom was determined to own the vessel when he went back into civilian life. This he did. He bought the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shangri La </EMPHASIS>and started a company by the name of Roylen&mdash;a name which became synonymous with tourism not only in the Mackay region and the Whitsundays but also elsewhere. He cobbled together the name from his son's and daughter's names&mdash;Fitzroy and Helen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very simple man, a man who did not have much of a brief for academics. He certainly had none for accountants or bankers. In fact, his belief was that the only reason accountants existed was that they received a percentage of a client's income tax for the year; he was absolutely certain of that. I could never prevail upon him, but he probably beat the system. Bankers, accountants and lawyers were the bane of his life because he was a practical person who did things. He did not do them with great flair. I suppose the highlight of Roylen Cruises was when he built on the fairmiles, which were the Second World War vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tom had about eight or nine vessels with which he opened up the Whitsundays. I am not saying that he was the person who created tourism in the Mackay district, but he did gain a respectability for those earlier pioneers like the Busuttins of Brampton and really built on an opportunity. I do not think he ever sought satisfaction in earning or owning money. His satisfaction was in seeing a thing to be done and doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had a brief political fling. He took the hardest of all seats, Bowen, which was held by a communist at one stage, but he did have that political interest. He had an interest in people. He was rewarded with the MBE and he was able to meet comfortably with royalty or anybody else. I pass on my condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The recent bushfires in New South Wales brought home to all Australians that certain summer reality that the threat of bushfire devastation is not far from us all as we enjoy what the summer has to offer. For Victorians like myself, it was a sharp reminder of that day roughly a decade ago when fire devastated our state on the now infamous Ash Wednesday. Watching graphic reports of the valiant efforts of professional and volunteer brigades to contain that recent disaster in New South Wales, one's admiration went out to those firefighters who risked their lives in defence of life and property. I felt a certain sense of pride in the fact that other states were prepared to commit human resources, capital equipment and expertise to fight the fires and limit the damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment briefly on the volunteer fire brigade force that formed the backbone of that effort. Volunteer firefighters are a rare breed. They spend considerable time in training for this important community task and they spend time, at considerable personal risk and emotional strain, fighting fires. However, time is not all these people give to their communities. The volunteer emergency work and training they perform may involve financial loss as well. There is always a cost involved in these commitments. For many volunteer firefighters, it might well be an opportunity forgone to work additional hours or to take on a part-time job to supplement the family income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, communities benefit from their volunteer firefighters. Many communities would not be able to afford to maintain a professional firefighting presence in their areas to cope with complex emergency situations which occur in industrial and residential communities. But, given the risk and the time commitment involved for volunteers, it is becoming increasingly difficult for communities to retain and recruit new ones. It is time perhaps that we consider modes of compensation that say to experienced and dedicated volunteers that we really do appreciate their efforts on our behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting proposition has been put to me by one of my constituents, Mr Royce Collier of Portarlington, who has recently retired after years of dedicated service to the Victorian volunteer fire brigade and to his national administrative body. He has put the proposal not for himself but to strengthen and nurture the volunteer force that he has unselfishly committed himself to down through the years. He has proposed that the community consider a sliding scale, long-service awards program that would financially reward volunteers with over 10 years of committed service to the movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, the average length of service of volunteer firefighters in Australia is 7 1/2 years. If this could be extended to 10 years and beyond, the cost benefits to the community would be obvious. There would be obvious savings to the community in a reduced turnover of personnel and there would also be considerable savings in the use and maintenance of equipment by experienced personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a scheme, which I understand operates in a similar mode in the USA, would retain valuable expertise in the volunteer force and be a powerful expression of the appreciation and gratitude of the community to these unsung heroes in our midst. It is a worthwhile proposition that I intend to take further and will explain further to the House at another time. I certainly thank Mr Collier for the time and the consideration he has put into this proposal  on  behalf  of  his  fellow  volunteers. </PARA>

We have not been told that there is anything wrong, we are going to be treated fairly and equitably, and the program will be allocated in accordance with proper ministerial principles and accountability.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in Victoria. There was a lot of disappointment; nevertheless, even at that stage, most country people accepted that the program had been administered fairly, allocated equitably and that ministerial responsibility had been observed. That is what they thought. Now we find that the story has unfolded. The Auditor-General has revealed his concern at the department's maladministration and failure to perform. The minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other ministers are now involved in a conspiracy to conceal the truth of their maladministration. All members of the community in Australia&mdash;not only those people who applied in good faith&mdash;can now see through the illusion that was created; they can see through it. It was a deliberate illusion to let people think that this program was going to be dealt with fairly. Now it is exposed for all the world to see. I conclude by putting to the House that the only difference between Tonya Harding, Michael Jackson and the minister is that some people think Tonya Harding and Michael Jackson are innocent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise to pay homage to some communities in my electorate and bordering on my electorate, one of which, the city of Wollongong, is very close to your heart. An agreement between the municipalities of Wollongong, Shellharbour, Kiama, the Illawarra Area Health Service and the World Health Organisation Collaborating Centre on Community Safety Promotion has been established. It is a program run by the World Health Organisation to recognise safe communities. It has been promoted world wide by the World Health Organisation as a strategy for communities to reduce injuries at local level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Health Organisation has established 12 standards which form the basis of the safe communities program. Within the program there is a strong focus on greater intersectoral cooperation and community participation in promoting safety at a local level. Currently 40 to 50 communities across 15 different countries are working to establish safe community programs. However, currently only eight communities have been officially recognised by the World Health Organisation for achievements in injury prevention. These include Lidkoping, Motala and Faulkoping in Sweden; Toulouse in France; Esbjerg in Denmark; Wang Khoi in Thailand; and Castlemilk and Corkerhill in Glasgow, Scotland. Illawarra&mdash;including the municipalities that I mentioned earlier&mdash;has been the first Australian community to be proclaimed by the World Health Organisation for the many achievements in injury prevention. Coming from that community and having been an alderman on one of those constituent councils, it is with great pride that I recognise the achievements that have been made under the Illawara healthy cities program. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GV5">Mr KNOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an excellent program, as the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs has said. Under that program, in 1992 the Illawarra established a whole range of long- and short-term safety programs. The first, the child injury prevention program, started in 1987. I must pay my respects to the RTA which externally funded this project with the aim of reducing accident injuries amongst all age groups in the Illawarra and making it a safer community. It addressed issues such as childhood, age, sports, domestic, road and workplace safety. The Illawarra safe communities program is all about working with all sectors of the community, such as health, education, local government and industry and community groups, et cetera, to identify local safety issues and find solutions to these problems. It also involves pooling of resources and working together on innovative safety projects. So far this has resulted in support and involvement from all sectors of the local community.</PARA></TALK.START>

Cooperation at this level and making our communities much safer for all those involved is an ideal that we all respect and are prepared to work for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) My Department has been conducting a review of low volume compliance plate approval arrangements as part of the Department's own policy of continuous improvement of its operations. The review also addressed the issue of whether the intent of the scheme, to provide access to specialist or enthusiast vehicles not otherwise available in Australia, was being achieved. The review found that the arrangements under the low volume scheme are not always being followed. The main areas of concern relate to assurance that vehicles meet the standards, particularly in regard to emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The option for low volume approvals up to 100 vehicles per annum has been removed for imported used cars. It is still available for new vehicles. The decision was taken because of concerns that some operators were seeking to use the option to operate at 100 vehicles per annum in arrangements to avoid the full cost of certification and the $12,000 duty on used cars imported in large numbers. These activities were seen to be contrary to the intent of the low volume scheme as set out in (1) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. Departmental officers inspected twenty vehicles and concluded that an issue existed. Action has been taken to advise operators of acceptable procedures to ensure compliance of production vehicles.</PARA>
