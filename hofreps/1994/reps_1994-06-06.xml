<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women, elections and parliament</EMPHASIS>. This report relates to a reference from the Senate proposing that the committee conduct an inquiry to discover the reasons for the gender imbalance in Australian parliaments, develop strategies for reducing the imbalance, and identify the aspects of parliamentary procedures and practices which impede the full participation of Australian women in Australian political life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself is short. It reflects the committee's conclusion that a conventional parliamentary committee inquiry would not be the best way for this committee to participate in a debate about ways to improve the representation of women in parliaments in Australia. The committee was assisted in reaching this conclusion by a paper prepared for it by Ms Consie Larmour of the social policy research group of the legislative research service of the Parliamentary Library. Ms Larmour's paper has been included as the appendix to our report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee regards this paper as accurately stating the present situation with regard to the matters broached by the terms of reference for the inquiry. It is the intention of the committee to make the paper widely available and to invite comments on it from the community. This will assist the monitoring process which the committee recommends for itself in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the first of the proposed terms of reference, namely, the reasons for the gender imbalance, it was apparent to the committee from Ms Larmour's paper that existing research had already established the reasons for the imbalance of men and women in Australian parliaments. It was the same with the second proposed term of reference, which asked the committee to consider strategies for increasing the number and effectiveness of women in political and electoral processes. The goal of achieving equity in representation has been accepted by all Australia's political parties, although the International Parliamentary Union has endorsed parity of representation without recommending a specific date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is general agreement within Australia that women should have equal employment opportunities, including in politics, but that there should not be an imposition of quotas. The immediate issue which all parties would endorse is the view that women should not be disadvantaged as compared with men in obtaining endorsement for seats in parliament. The report and appendix describe current ideas and strategies for achieving this aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee felt that matters had moved beyond the point of proposing strategies; these had already been identified and were now being implemented as actual programs by the various parties. The committee has concluded that the most valuable role it can perform in the light of this ongoing activity is to monitor developments on behalf of the parliament so far as they relate to the electoral process. Accordingly, it recommends in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Minister for Administrative Services authorise the committee under para (1) of its resolution of appointment to monitor developments in the area of the participation by women in the electoral process and to report on this matter from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not consider that it was authorised to conduct an inquiry on the third of the terms of reference. The report notes recent developments to introduce sitting hours for the Senate and the House which we see as being more conducive to family life than the traditional hours. However, matters of parliamentary procedure and practice are outside the scope of the authority conferred on the committee by the parliament and would be more appropriately undertaken by the respective procedure committees of the Senate and the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the committee to distribute the Parliamentary Research Service paper among community groups, inviting comments and responses from within these communities. To this end, the research service paper has been printed as part of the report that I have just tabled. Mr Speaker, I commend the report to the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I have a few moments to spare, I will take the opportunity to address the House on some of my personal views on this matter, as distinct from those in my capacity as the deputy chairman of the committee. The Liberal Party believes that, in every sense of the term, women must have a fair go in all aspects of Australian society. We must ensure that women are not placed at a disadvantage. One of the big issues, therefore, which all members of parliament and the community as a whole have to address is the identification of the fact that women have been placed at a disadvantage in the past in relation to accessing the political system. This does not mean that there have not been many outstanding women in Australian politics over many years, and it certainly does not mean that there is not a growing number of women in the Australian political process at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that there are 11 women Liberal federal members and senators at the present time. We have had a number of women both in the outer shadow ministry as well as in the shadow cabinet. There are, in fact, now over 30 Liberal women in state and territory parliaments. Three of the eight New South Wales Liberal women are ministers; two of the nine Victorian Liberal women are ministers; one of the five Western Australian Liberal women is a minister; and one of the eight South Australian Liberal women is also a minister. In the recent South Australian state election, five out of the six Liberal women candidates won seats, compared to one out of 10 Labor women; only two of the successful Liberals were considered to be in safe seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the historical view, it is interesting to note that the first woman to be elected to any Australian parliament was Edith Cowan from Western Australia in 1921. The first woman elected to the House of Representatives was Dame Enid Lyons from Tasmania in 1943; the first woman federal cabinet minister was Dame Enid Lyons. The first woman elected to state cabinet was Dame Florence Cardell-Oliver in Western Australia in 1947. The first woman elected as state president of a major political party, the Liberal Party, was Miss Joy Mein in Victoria in 1976. The year in which the first woman elected to each state parliament from non-Labor parties was: Western Australia, in 1921; New South Wales, in 1925; Queensland, in 1929; Victoria, in 1933; Tasmania, in 1955; and South Australia, in 1959. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was under a Liberal government that the policy of opening the armed forces to women was achieved in 1941. The introduction of child endowment was established in the same year. The women's bureau to develop ideas and arguments for reform of women's employment was introduced in 1963. The lifting of the marriage ban in the Commonwealth Public Service, a most profound and vital reform, was introduced by a Liberal government in 1966. Perhaps the most significant reform of all was also introduced by a Liberal government in 1972, with the equal pay legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Care Act to assist non-profit organisations to establish and operate day care centres was introduced in 1972. The introduction of family allowance payments directed to the mother occurred during 1976-77. The national inquiry into the role of women, which led to the establishment of the National Women's Advisory Council, was introduced by the Fraser government. We also established the Human Rights Commission under Dame Roma Mitchell, the first chairman. We established the first Institute of Family Studies in 1980, and signed the Copenhagen Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which formed the basis of the Sex Discrimination Act of July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all fundamental and profound reforms introduced by the non-Labor parties into the federal parliament of this nation which have supported women, families and the overall principle that in this society women must be equal to men in all respects, especially in relation to their opportunities to access the political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the important things we need to note in the present environment, however, is the tendency for the government now to take the view that having women in parliament can be achieved only through quotas. We oppose the introduction of quotas because we fundamentally believe that the principle of a quota means that you often end up taking second best. This parliament and the people of Australia deserve the best at all times. We need to have women of outstanding quality standing for pre-selection and, in so doing, feeling that they have as good an opportunity as any man to seek the support of the preselectors and ultimately the support of the electors of those respective electorates. Then and only then will women be able to stand in this House and say, `We are here as your equals. We have been put here by the people of Australia on the basis of what we can contribute to the Australian political system and to our nation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we do not support the introduction of quotas. But we certainly support the introduction of programs within political parties which will encourage women to stand for pre-selection, will encourage women to be trained and to be given every possible opportunity to feel that they can advance within the process, knowing that there are no bands, that there are no glass ceilings and that there are no constraints holding them back. It is only then that the women of Australia will be able to say of the Australian political system, `It is fair and under it we are equal in all respects.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters commissioned a paper from the social policy group of the Parliamentary Research Service of the Parliamentary Library. The committee has concluded that the most valuable role it can perform in light of that report is by way of ongoing activity to monitor developments on behalf of the parliament so far as they relate to the electoral process and how they affect women. It is the intention of the committee to distribute the Parliamentary Research Service paper inviting comments and responses from the community. These community responses will be collected and, where appropriate, reported to the parliament. After wide community consultation for its reference into equal opportunity and equal status for women in Australia, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;I was also a member of that committee&mdash;stated in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Half way to equal</EMPHASIS>, the Lavarch report of April 1992:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes that it is incumbent on political parties to redress the gender imbalance where it currently exists so that it more accurately reflects the constituency.</PARA>
<PARA>Its recommendation was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that all political parties examine their selection procedures for systematic discrimination against women and develop appropriate affirmative action programs which give women equal opportunity to take a greater role in the political process.</PARA>
<PARA>Last Thursday, 2 June 1994, the Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), made her first speech in this place. I think it is worth quoting two parts of that speech because I think they summarise basically my view in relation to this matter. She quoted the political columnist Alan Ramsey, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are rarely any free kicks for women in politics. No matter how much or how little ability they might have, and whatever the expedient rhetoric of the time, men run politics and women get only what men will you them to have. Mostly they're manipulated, exploited and patronised.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister concluded her speech as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My message to women is: do not wait to be asked; do not wait to be pressured into political life&mdash;put up your hand and demand that you participate. To quote a very feisty woman, Sarah Henderson, `All the strength you need is within you. Don't wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel. Stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself.'</PARA>
<PARA>The statistics, as revealed in our report at page 54, are appalling. The statistics on women in Australian parliaments as at 13 April 1994 are as follows: in the House of Representatives there are 15 out of 147, 10.2 per cent; and in the Senate, 17 out of 76, 22.37 per cent. In all the parliaments in Australia, women have 132 positions out of 841, 15.7 per cent; for lower houses, it is 81 out of 604, 13.41 per cent; and for upper houses, 51 out of 237, 21.52 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we as a parliament are to retain any credibility in the community, we need to be representative of our constituency. We need more women in the parliament. We need more people from ethnic backgrounds in the parliament because they too are underrepresented; but it will not just happen. I am part of the Left in New South Wales. My seat in this parliament was obtained not because it was given to me but because I took it. And that is what women need to do&mdash;take their rightful place!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco from 9 November to 3 December 1993. The delegation to both the Middle East and the Maghreb occurred at a very critical time in the conduct of the peace process. More recently, we have seen those agreements, which were of enormous historical significance, come to fruition: on Friday, 13 May, the last Israeli soldiers withdrew from Jericho; and on Wednesday, 18 May, the last Israeli soldiers withdrew from Gaza after 27 years of occupation which followed from the 1967 war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a great privilege for the members of the delegation to represent the parliament at such a critical time. The issues that were addressed, the people we met, the places visited and the institutions observed were of enormous value to the delegation and, as a result, of enormous value to the parliament. I commend the report to all honourable members; in fact, I commend it to those people in the wider community who have any interest at all in the Middle East and the Mahgreb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I offer a special thanks to the host governments and all of those outstanding people who represented them during our visits. Their hospitality was absolute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay special tribute to the members of the delegation: the deputy leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), Senator Gerry Jones, Senator Baden Teague, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), and Mr Peter Stephens, the secretary, who has been kind enough to grace us with his presence in the advisers seat this morning. I thank Peter very much for the way in which he undertook the initial preparation and the way he facilitated and assisted all of the delegates and their spouses during that delegation. Had it not been for his professional competence and commitment, it could not have been as successful as it was. His follow-up was carried out in the same exemplary manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was particularly pleased, as I have also indicated, to have as a member Daryl Melham, who is the son of Lebanese parents. It was of great value not only because of his high standing within the Australian parliament but also because of his high standing in Lebanon. It provided a personal dimension to that deputation which could not possibly have occurred otherwise. Daryl was able to represent the Australian parliament at a conference in Lebanon during the visit of members of parliament of Lebanese descent to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the independence of Lebanon. As we were sure he would, and as was subsequently confirmed, he carried out that responsibility with great dignity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to thank you, Mr Speaker, and the former President of the Senate, Senator Kerry Sibraa, for the personal commitment which you both brought to this delegation. I was very conscious, as you know, of your intercession during the delegation's visit to ensure that the purposes of this parliament were fulfilled by it. I thank you and, of course, the former President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among other things, the delegation visited Morocco. This was the first time a delegation from this parliament had visited Morocco and it was the first delegation of any kind to visit Morocco after the introduction of democratic elections, so that was particularly important. One particularly impressive element of the visit and the people we met and the discussions we had was the almost 1 1/2 hours we spent with Yasser Arafat, the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, and a person I had identified, as would others, as being the personal symbol of the aspirations of the Palestinian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trip undertaken by the delegation which was so ably led by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) covered an enormous area in the Middle East and North Africa. It is an area which we, as Australians, do not see much of primarily because it formed part of the old French empire or colonies and, as a consequence, the connections we had with it were almost wholly of our own making. Peter Stephens, as secretary of the delegation, played an enormous part in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For my part, I was particularly keen and pleased to see the business opportunities in those areas, not only in Syria, which will be difficult, where we currently sell sheep, but also in Beirut where the reconstruction program is immense in every respect. I have not seen a city as devastated as that since Berlin. The rebuilding program, which will cost billions of Australian dollars over five to 10 years, presents enormous opportunities in communications, construction and general administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We moved on to Tunisia and, once again, saw a country with which Australia has very little contact and a small amount of trade. One Australian there is doing a very commendable job in agriculture and we ought to assist such people to pick up in the areas in which we can deliver considerable expertise, in particular, soil rejuvenation and management, and fencing and trees, to bring stability to the general landscape, which is certainly in need of it. Those areas of Tunisia which we visited where money has been invested in the rural sector, are very productive, but an enormous amount still needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same situation applied to Morocco, another country with which we have very little connection. But there are  opportunities there in agriculture and in some of the manufacturing sectors to be taken up. I raise these matters because our representation in North Africa is run from Paris. It is quite a step to take in France, the associated EC countries and then go to North Africa, which is so much further down the line. In Morocco we are represented by the Canadian Embassy. As such, once again our connection is a step back from positive endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Trade Office in Paris seems to be doing a good job. The representative whom we met impressed me with his capacity to be able to get out and about and to put together a commercial program. But, if we are going to be fair dinkum about our investment and our involvement in North Africa, it would be necessary to have somebody based in Tunis or somewhere in that area to cement our relations. In itself, that will not help unless Australian business is prepared to make the extra effort to go into those areas. Business says that it will cost money, and certainly it will, but these businesses must be pushed along because there are millions of dollars in opportunities for us in those areas. I will not take up any more time of the House. I simply thank members of the committee and the secretary for their help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is enormous goodwill towards Australia throughout the Middle East and the Maghreb. The sacrifice of young Australians in the liberation of the region in two world wars is remembered with affection and gratitude. The Australian government fully supports the Taif Accord signed between Lebanon and Syria at the conclusion of the civil war, which includes agreement on a framework for the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and the extension of the Lebanese government's authority throughout Lebanon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major concern for the Lebanese government, expressed to the delegation on a number of occasions, is the continuing violence and security situation in southern Lebanon. There is an appreciation of Australia's even-handedness in the problems of the region and a special appreciation of our fulsome support for the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations. All opportunities were taken to emphasise Australia's support for the peace process and the necessity for a just, lasting and honourable peace among all the people of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has made clear over several years that it opposes any activity in Lebanon by outside forces which compromises Lebanese sovereignty. In this connection Australia considers Israel should withdraw from Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolution 425. The withdrawal of Syrian forces would also represent a major step towards full realisation of Lebanese sovereignty. As a result of the civil war the Australian Embassy in Beirut was closed in 1984. Lebanon is keen for Australia to reopen its embassy in Beirut as this would represent a vote of confidence in Lebanon's process of national reconciliation. This matter was raised repeatedly with the delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has advised the Lebanese government that it hopes conditions in Lebanon will soon permit an early resumption of resident representation. In the meantime, an Australian government office has been opened in the Mayflower hotel in Beirut to facilitate the provision of immigration and consular services to Australian and Lebanese citizens, and it has attracted a considerable number of clients. As far as the delegation is aware, the office has operated without any significant incidents since it opened. The delegation recommends that the Australian government give priority to re-establishing resident accreditation in Lebanon as soon as the security situation permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was honoured to be part of the Australian parliament's delegation to the Middle East.

It certainly impressed me, as someone from the land, that invaluable research is being done where all the wheats of the world originated from. We, as a nation, ought to make sure that we promote the work that is done there, particularly to our Australian wheat growers.

As we talk here today, it is rather distressing to see that troops are, once again, assembling on the border of Lebanon. It certainly disturbs me and it should disturb all Australians. In Beirut, we visited the Commonwealth war graves. It was particularly distressing to me and members of the delegation to see the desecration of the war graves in Lebanon.

Over 60 per cent of our trade is now in the Asia-Pacific area. Eight of our 12 largest export markets and six of our major suppliers are located in that region. Two-way trade between Australia and the countries immediately to our north&mdash;the ASEAN nations&mdash;grew by 45 per cent between 1990 and 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore essential that Australia participate fully in the affairs of the region. The ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation, AIPO, provides an important avenue for us to develop our links with the ASEAN nations. There is no better means for promoting those links than regular face-to-face contact during which issues of mutual national interest can be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bilateral dialogue session at the conference between the Australian delegation and representatives of each of the ASEAN nations covered a wide range of topics, including regional security, the development of APEC and the east Asian economic caucus, human rights, tourism and health issues. Importantly, the dialogue session was friendly as well as frank and I was struck by the goodwill that exists for Australia. It is something upon which we must continue to build. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no better way to demonstrate Australia's commitment to the region than by active participation in regional forums such as AIPO. AIPO is an important means of strengthening parliamentary institutions in the ASEAN countries. It is self-evident that it is in Australia's interests to support, through our continued participation, the excellent work of AIPO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While in Malaysia for the AIPO conference, the delegation had a chance to undertake a number of bilateral meetings with Malaysian ministers and officials. We had a lengthy and very cordial meeting with the President of the Malaysian Senate. Remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that over 100,000 Malaysians were educated in Australia&mdash;graduates of Australian universities&mdash;and the goodwill that exists within Malaysia towards Australia is there to be seen and appreciated. For myself, I appreciated the courtesies extended to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prosperity that Malaysia's economic development has brought in recent decades is clearly evident in the skyline of its capital and in the modern factories which are everywhere apparent. The bilateral visits undertaken by the delegation to the Republic of the Philippines and to Brunei Darussalam were also highly informative and most effective in strengthening our relationship with those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Philippines in particular we had an extremely busy program that enabled us to accomplish a great deal. We had discussions with a number of ministers and key officials and dialogue sessions with members of the Congress and the Senate, and were honoured with a detailed briefing by the President of the Philippines, President Ramos, the most distinguished leader of his country. We visited the islands of Cebu and Mindanao, which provided us with an opportunity of seeing the potential of those areas as well as the excellent achievements of Australia's aid program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubting the special warmth of the relationship between Australia and the Philippines. Australia has provided considerable aid assistance to the Philippines&mdash;more than $30 million annually&mdash;which has been well targeted and effectively implemented. That aid has produced real benefits for the Filipino people and, let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is appreciated by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Philippines needs assistance particularly with the protection and regeneration of its forests with land care. Australia's expertise in these areas would be very much welcomed by the Philippines government. The report also mentions our visit to the Philippines eagle breeding program in Mindanao. The eagle is the symbol of the Philippines, its independence and its pride, and whatever assistance Australia could provide to ensure the success of rescuing the eagle from extinction we should give willingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia could also provide technological assistance to the Philippines Commission on Elections, which is in the process of modernising its voting system. The people of the Philippines have fought to keep their country democratic. Australia should do what it can to help the democratic system in the country to function efficiently and honestly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many opportunities for greater economic involvement by Australian companies in the Philippines. There are opportunities in infrastructure development, food, mining, sugar, tourism and marine industries and the provision of educational services and pollution control materials and methods. The Philippines have so far largely missed out on the rapid growth experienced by other ASEAN countries but the potential is clearly there, as is evidenced by the recent months of dramatic growth in the economy of the Philippines. In recent years the government of the Philippines has implemented many economic reforms and investment is welcomed. Those Australian companies which have invested in the Philippines are reaping the rewards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should become involved in the economic development of the ASEAN growth triangle of the southern Philippines, Brunei, Sulawesi, Kalimantan and Labuan. This region is very close to our northern shores. In eastern Malaysia, where Australian troops fought during the period of confrontation, there is much potential for Australian investment and trade and an Australian presence to work in cooperation with Malaysia. I commend to the parliament that there be a more active involvement in this area. Among the recommendations in the delegation's report is the suggestion that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) consider the establishment of regular direct air links between Darwin and Davao city on Mindanao and that measures be taken to increase commercial shipping links between Australia and the southern Philippines and, may I add, eastern Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our visit to Brunei demonstrated to the delegation that our relationship is on a sound footing. We were received with every courtesy and assistance. We held very useful discussions with ministers and officials across a wide range of portfolio areas. The report identifies some matters where difficulties have arisen and areas that warrant investigation. There is a certain lack of confidence on the Brunei side in the capacity of Australia to supply meat which has been killed according to halal requirements. This needs to be fully examined to correct the impediment to trade between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much that could be done to develop education links between Brunei and Australia. A recent agreement for more cooperation and training in education was signed between the University of Brunei and James Cook University. A delegation of representatives from Australian education institutions could help provide and promote mutual understanding and could help develop twinning arrangements at the tertiary level. Although Brunei is not a large country, it does have considerable wealth. There are opportunities for Australian companies to become involved in the development of Brunei's infrastructure needs and in the provision of food and consumer goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was particularly pleased to be given a thorough tour of the oil and gas developments on which Brunei's wealth is based. By way of contrast, we also had the chance to travel into Batu Apoi forest reserve and to the Kuala Belong Field Studies Centre. It is clear that Brunei recognises the wealth of its flora and fauna as well as that which lies under its lands and seas. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)is of the view that the Australian Government should declare Anzac Day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year and on no other day.</PARA>
<PARA>I indicate to the House that this motion carries the unanimous endorsement of the national RSL executive and is in fact RSL policy. As Anzac Day is currently subject to state acts, it is its legitimate request that Anzac Day should be a federal responsibility, should become Australia's day of national commemoration and should be held on 25 April each year. I make it clear that that request&mdash;which I regard as a very simple request and one that ought to be acceded to by this parliament&mdash;is not intended to compete or detract from any other national day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of Anzac Day this House agreed on the significance of Anzac Day and endorsed the statement that the Anzac Day tradition and its commemoration, far from being a glorification of the waste of war or a celebration of militarism, represents a statement of values and ideals of service of enduring relevance to the people of Australia. The fact that Gallipoli claimed over 7,500 lives, that 46,000 Australians lie in the cemeteries of France and Belgium, that 18,000 Australian troops perished and have no known grave and that 152,000 were wounded changed forever Australia's perceptions of itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of a generation, the talent wasted that can never be measured, the generation gap that struck at the very heart of Australian country towns, regions and cities, and the enduring tragedy for those thousands of Australian women whose grief and reparable loss had to be lived with day by day meant that the term `Anzac' wrote into our national lexicon concepts of sacrifice, commitment and mateship that have come to embody the finest qualities of our people. Anzac Day is now the day when we remember our war dead&mdash;all young and in all conflicts. It is a day which gives common purpose to all who were born here or who have come here and want Australia to be their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be no member of this parliament who has not been involved in Anzac Day ceremonies. There is one aspect of those ceremonies that we would do well to evaluate in this year of 1994. Why is it that the numbers of those attending these ceremonies have increased dramatically in recent years? Why do young Australian backpackers going overseas make constant visits to Gallipoli, almost in the nature of a pilgrimage? I believe that, in a sense, the parliament is lagging behind what is happening in the community. Australians, both here and overseas, on Anzac Day are voting with their feet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the ranks grow thinner, the audiences grow larger. One only has to attend a dawn ceremony and see the tear-stained faces of older generations and young people to realise that Anzac Day has inspired very real commitments in all generations of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mentioning that, I think we have to pay a very real debt of gratitude to, and place on record, the role played by the Returned Services League of Australia in its staunch advocacy, defence and development of current Anzac Day ceremonies. This nation is very much in its debt and is the reason the motion comes before the House in this way. It would have been open to me, as it would have been to some of my colleagues, to advance it through the party room, but because Anzac Day is not and cannot be the prerogative of any one political party or any one individual, it has to be the responsibility of this parliament, both in the sense of the role of the individual member and the collective responsibility of the parliament itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that our parliamentary system, based on the Westminster tradition, is always and inevitably in an adversarial situation. The average Australian who listens to the parliamentary broadcasts or even attends this place could conclude that there are very few things about which we in this place are agreed. I believe there is at least one thing&mdash;that is, Anzac Day&mdash;about which this parliament, in its individual and collective membership, is agreed. It is necessary that we do that which I think, as I have already pointed out, the Australian people recognise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the ranks of the original Anzacs are very small indeed and that those who served in the last world war are reducing in number.

<PARA>Surely there would be no-one in this House of this parliament who could disagree with this motion. It is straightforward. It does not impose any encumbrance whatsoever to 26 January being regarded and maintained as Australia's national day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrary to what certain people have interpreted this motion to mean, it intends that Anzac Day shall be an official day of commemoration&mdash;no more than that but, most importantly, certainly no less than that. This motion has unanimous support of the national executive of the Returned Services League. In fact, the official announcement of it was made on 14 April this year in the company of the National President of the RSL, Major General Digger James&mdash;I do not know him by any other name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed by the New South Wales state president of the RSL that it has its `200 per cent support'. This motion had the support of the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating), and the unqualified support of the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and the Leader of the National Party of Australia in this place, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). I would expect that on this day of presentation of the motion it would have the wholehearted support of all sides of this House. It is a strange coincidence that our motion is being put before the House on the 50th anniversary of D-day in Europe&mdash;itself a very significant date for the whole of Europe and, in fact, the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mover of this motion, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, has put the case most eloquently. I must pay tribute to him at this stage of my speech and say how pleased I was that he phoned me from Melbourne, and we have had many a discussion since then. Though I have supported this motion totally as a member of the opposition to show that there is a bipartisan approach to this in every possible way, I still have no hesitation in saying that this is his motion. Anything that I might add about Anzac Day has nothing to do with issues other than tribute paid to those Australians who gave of themselves and, in fact, themselves to defend our country. We have all attended Anzac Day services, dawn services in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise one significant point, and that is that there are very few Anzacs left with us. It so happens that the veterans of the Second World War now have a declared average age in the mid-70s. One can see that in the not too distant future we shall have only memories of our veterans. Unless we take the trouble as a parliament to legislate to ensure that Anzac Day shall be celebrated for eternity in Australia as a day of commemoration on 25 April in each year, we will be  doing a disservice to all those Australians who served their country in the armed services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could go on for hours with anecdotes of particular veterans and particular moving observations of Anzac Day itself. Suffice it to say that I have attended the dawn service of the Miranda RSL for 30 years. As each year passes, the dawn service, in particular, becomes more significant to the general public here and all around Australia. In fact, there is a growing interest in, and a search for knowledge about, Anzac Day and its significance by young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One more anecdote is that a number of years ago, when I was in Zimbabwe observing the election of Muzorewa, I was part of the celebration of Anzac Day which was held at that country's memorial to the fallen who had served and died for their country in the interests of peace. Our small service, with MPs from both sides of this House, was observed and shared by many of the local citizens of all political colours. This commemoration is worldwide, and it is deeply felt by all people of all races, colours, religions and backgrounds. I am sure that each member of this House can tell of equally moving and significant commemorative celebrations. As one grows older, one can only hope that this commemorative day will be celebrated by future generations of Australians as yet unborn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate at this time to bring a rather interesting point before the House which relates to the composition of the Australian forces which landed at Gallipoli on Anzac Day in 1915. One-third of those Australians who went to Gallipoli were migrants to Australia. I wonder whether honourable members had considered that such a large proportion of our fighting force which served Australia in that capacity 80 years ago were migrants. We must never allow that spirit to be lost. I hope that people will contemplate the spirit that caused people to be Anzacs and to fight for Australia since then. I believe the fact that such a large percentage of Australians at Gallipoli were migrants should do much to convince the present migrant population of Australia, among whom I count myself, to appreciate the reason for the continuing commemoration of the Anzac spirit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finish by expressing my personal thanks to Senator David MacGibbon for assisting with this motion in the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To many people, Australia Day denotes when Westminster decided that this land officially became its penal colony. It was not a great day for the convicts that came out here; nor was it a great day for Aboriginal people, and it is not very significant for a lot of ethnic groups here in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that we have had, for instance, with the states being unable to recognise 26 January as an official holiday for Australia Day, indicates what could happen with Anzac Day.

Lest Anzac Day become a date to be varied when pressures are on, we need to support the motion&mdash;and we need to support it now.

I hasten to add that we are not remembering a failure. Certainly, the landing at Gallipoli could be seen as a military failure, just as Vietnam could probably be seen as a military and perhaps political failure, depending on how we look at it. But we are not remembering failures when we remember Anzac Day and when we remember people who represented us in wartime.

This changed; there was a maturing of our nation at Anzac Day and after it. It really was the genesis of new world links that were espoused by Curtin, and later Menzies. It was before the debate, for instance, about what should be our official flag. There was a vitriolic debate in the 1930s about whether it should be the Union Jack or the blue ensign, as we know it. It was the genesis of Australia seeing itself as a nation, not as part of another nation. </PARA>

Anzac Day not only commemorates those who served at Gallipoli; it is a time to reflect and remember all those who served Australia in all conflicts, from the beaches of Turkey in the First World War to the jungles of Papua New Guinea in World War II and in every other conflict where Australians have served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was in the First World War at Gallipoli and in many other battles that Australians, perhaps unknowingly, forged a new identity for their nation. The cost to our young nation of serving in that war was enormous. An entire generation of Australians was affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The distinguished war historian C.E.W. Bean has recorded that 331,781 Australians served overseas in the First World War. Of that number, 250,000 became casualties. More than 8,000 Australians died at Gallipoli. Of this, more than 5,000 were killed in action while others died later of wounds. In the first nine weeks at the Somme, 23,000 Australians died; at Ypres, 38,000; and at Bullecourt, 10,000. The list goes on. Of the 330,000 troops who fought, more than 70 per cent were casualties, which arguably constituted the highest rate per capita for any of the nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that in 1914 the population of Australia was approximately five million, we can see how the First World War had a tremendous effect on the nation's psyche. The average age of Australians who enlisted in Australia was between 14 and 18. This era marked one of the very few periods, if not the only period, in Australia's modern history when the population decreased. Not only did it affect those involved directly; we can only imagine the sadness that pervaded the nation as most families suffered the loss of a loved one or close friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the march of time is taking its toll on those who served in the First World War and who were fortunate enough to return. I recall a speech I gave in 1985 when I informed the House that only 5,500 Australians who served overseas in the First World War remained alive. Today, almost a decade later, that figure has dwindled dramatically. It is estimated by the Repatriation Commission and the Department of Veterans' Affairs that by 30 June this year there will be only 550 World War I veterans left. According to the estimates, that would be a decrease of 400 since the same time 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that time is running out for the veterans of World War I. These men and women did more to bring respect and recognition to Australia in the early stages of its history than anyone or anything else. Because of this, this motion is all the more appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my belief that in recent years Australians have renewed their interest in the history of their nation in all aspects, particularly in its war history. During my time as a member of parliament, I have seen this interest grow in my electorate. The number of those attending Anzac Day services has increased, even though veterans of all the conflicts in which we have been involved are becoming fewer in number. In the Riverina, I have noted that small children attend with older members of their family. Many of their parents have no direct connection with the First World War or Second World War; in fact, many were not born in Australia, but they realise how important this tradition is to Australia and Australians. It is interesting to note that many Australians who served in the First World War were immigrants or children of immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent burial of the Unknown Soldier has further increased national consciousness of the contribution made by those who served their nation in war. As with most parliamentary members, I was honoured to be present at the entombment of the Unknown Soldier in the Australian War Memorial. Our War Memorial is an institution all Australians can be proud of. It is the national symbol of sacrifice and is a reflection of the smaller memorials which can be found in most cities, towns and villages across this vast continent. In some places, these memorials&mdash;some modest, some grand&mdash;have outlasted the local population which has long vanished, and they further indicate the effect the Great War had on Australia. So they should stand proudly, if sadly, to commemorate the young Australians who gave their lives in service to their nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the First World War that is rapidly moving out of living memory; next year, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Around the world, the generation of national leaders who were born or served in World War II or before is retiring. I believe it is therefore time to formally recognise in this place the importance of ensuring that Anzac Day is our national day of commemoration. It should be recognised always on 25 April each year and on no other day. I would point out that it is not my desire or intention to compare the importance of Anzac Day with Australia Day or any other day. However, the sacred quality of Anzac Day and its symbolism must be retained in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we commemorate Anzac Day, we are not glorifying war. A glance at the horrific figures of death, debilitation and destruction which I have just recounted puts paid to any such notion. I was therefore rather dismayed to read yesterday that a so-called peace group, the Sydney Anti-bases Action Committee, said that ceremonies commemorating D-day glorified war and distorted history. We can imagine what such groups must think of Anzac Day and other days of commemoration. If we do not recognise and honour those who fought for our nation, our national identity would not be complete. It is easy today to take for granted the freedoms which the blood and sacrifice of previous generations have made possible for us to enjoy. Therefore, we must always remember Anzac Day and we must always treat our veterans with the respect they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditions laid down at Gallipoli and on other battlefields of the First World War were the standards that the fighting men and women who served in the Second World War and subsequent conflicts, such as Korea and Vietnam, and more recently our peacekeeping forces, have upheld with honour. As Australians, we have all been left a legacy of comradeship, courage and tenacity of which we should be proud and which allows us to hold our heads high wherever we travel throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am honoured to be able to speak to this motion today, which I hope will go some way to preserving for all time the day on which we remember those who, in my view, above all others, have placed their indelible mark on the pages of Australian history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year, in company with several of my colleagues who are about to speak or have spoken in this debate, an interesting incident occurred during an inspection by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In an informal meeting with an officer from the RAAF in Darwin, when discussing the issue of Gallipoli and its significance to Australia, he indicated that history would have had a different record of Gallipoli if only the allied forces had moved in on the Dardanelles some months before the Turkish army was able to fortify that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting insight into history and how our attitudes may have changed. It is said that on Anzac Day we are celebrating one of the great military defeats, but we all recognise that it is much more than that. I commend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) for bringing forward this motion to the parliament. Unfortunately, I suspect that, for a number of reasons, this motion will not receive a great deal of media attention, the principal reason being that both opposition and government members support this motion. Because we have that level of bipartisan support, this debate will not attract the news and the media interest as would other debates. Nonetheless, it is significant that the views that are being expressed here are shared right across the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Hicks) about the number of survivors left from World War I. It is understandable that there are fewer than 600. It is interesting also that when we go through the hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of honour rolls throughout this nation, particularly in small towns and villages, we see the same surname repeated time after time. When we recognise that we did suffer the highest per capita rate of casualties and deaths in World War I, as honourable members have pointed out, we can understand the debilitating effect that it had on those country towns and villages subsequent to World War I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I was able to make a suggestion to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and also to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) that perhaps we need to do something about some of the memorials around Australia. I believe this is a great opportunity for federal government, in conjunction with local government, to look at a program of putting funds into the restoration of the many memorials that we see around Australia, many of which are in very poor shape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While perhaps people's views of memorials have changed dramatically over the years, the fact remains that they are an important part of our history. To that extent, they should not be forgotten. I would like honourable members to think about that proposition. If they believe there is merit in taking further the sentiments behind this motion, in not only making Anzac Day Australia's national day of commemoration but also looking at the possibility of enhancing and restoring some of our memorials that are scattered around the length and breadth of this country, it would be very much appreciated by the veterans and their families who have survived them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Anzac Day should be seen by this nation as a national day of commemoration. Like the other speakers, I do not seek to replace Anzac Day with Australia Day as a day of significance to this nation. But the fact remains that we certainly would not get any great community division on a notion that the Australian government make a declaration as to Anzac Day being a national day of commemoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes beyond that. We all recognise that on Anzac Day we are celebrating the loss, the suffering and the contribution made by countless thousands of men and women in World War II as well as in subsequent battles. Irrespective of the rights and wrongs of our involvement in any of those wars, the fact remains that governments send people to wars.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a mixture of sadness and humility, but with a large dose of national pride, that I add my unqualified bipartisan support to the motion of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) on this historic day of 6 June, which was such a turning point half a century ago in World War II. For those Australians who were part of the D-day operations in Europe, it simply reinforced the well-established and respected Anzac spirit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is said by some that Australia came of age as a nation at Anzac Cove in 1915, this remains a questionable viewpoint. Nevertheless, there is a modicum of truth in this perception. Although a nation surely does not need a major war only to achieve a sense of identity, the Gallipoli campaign gave all Australians the opportunity to identify positively with Australian forces fighting in a distinct campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anzac Day is remembered and revered for three reasons. Firstly, our troops showed courage and fortitude throughout the operation. We might have been defeated, but we did not run away. We withdrew in good order in a manoeuvre still regarded as one of the most skilfully conducted withdrawals in adverse conditions ever attempted. Secondly, throughout the Gallipoli campaign, Australian and New Zealand troops did everything which could reasonably be expected of them and more. The failure of the operation lay with its planners, not with the troops assigned to the job. Finally, and most importantly, the Gallipoli campaign was the first major campaign in which Australian troops fought as a body under their own commanders and carried the bulk of the operation on their own shoulders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people may try to use this memory to glorify war or to justify later wars, but this is not the real significance of Gallipoli and the Anzac spirit at all. That significance lies in our understanding of the sacrifices and privations willingly undertaken by those who fought in the service of their country then and who have done so since. In 1991 a senior churchman in New South Wales said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians have become too accepting of war and the Anzac Day celebrations have fuelled, in part, an all-too-easy alliance . . . I am very troubled about the war myth that seems to have gripped Australia and I believe it's all because we are conditioned by our tradition to accept war, and Anzac Day is part of that tradition&mdash;I know it is meant to remember sacrifice and bravery but in a subtle way it makes war seem acceptable to us.</PARA>
<PARA>I reject that simplistic view which shows how 25 April has been misrepresented by some. Anzac Day is not a glorification of war. It is a tribute to those who died for the nation and is a stark warning of the misery which war brings. It is the nation's collective funeral which should be treated with the dignity and deep reverence it deserves. It is a healing experience&mdash;a time when lost comrades can be remembered; a time when veterans can mix and talk with people who have suffered the trauma of battle; and a time when we draw together as a nation to remember those who have served and/or fallen to maintain our democratic ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as Australia Day on 26 January celebrates national unity, acknowledges our nation builders and is the occasion on which our pioneers are honoured, so it is entirely appropriate that we have a separate occasion to honour the men and women who fought to preserve the work of those pioneers. However, common to both Anzac Day and Australia Day is a sense of national unity and purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that all of us in this place today honour that spirit of progress and understanding. We should particularly pay tribute to the memory of those who have paid the supreme sacrifice since Federation. In doing so, I hope that all of us will recommit ourselves to the Australian national ethos and its enhancement. I salute the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for his initiative. I commend his motion to the House, particularly part (5), which calls for the declaration of Anzac Day on 25 April as Australia's national day of commemoration. In this way, the spirit of Anzac will live on in legislative form. Mr Deputy Speaker, lest we forget. </PARA>

However, this does not in any way diminish my respect and my admiration for and especially my gratitude to those Australian men and women whose selfless service and sacrifice made such an era possible. Those are the feelings that so many Australians want to express every Anzac Day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to salute the spirit that moved them but, more than that, we also want to express our pride in being Australian because somehow the idea of being Australian is inextricably linked with the Anzac legend. The very first commemoration of Anzac Day was held only one year after the Gallipoli landing. One might wonder, with the Great War still to rage for another two years, why a special day was set aside to mark a battle fought on the other side of the world, a battle acknowledging a defeat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was celebrated with unprecedented fervour and thrill. To understand this, one has to understand our national psyche at the time. The Commonwealth was only 14 years old: a federation of states divided by jealousy and suspicion, founded in such totally different ways&mdash;from the squalid dumping ground at Sydney Cove for British felons to Colonel Light's planned city in South Australia for middle-class free settlers. A new nation had certainly been formed, but it had no traditions and no symbols of its new identity. The AIF troops doing their training in Egypt still thought of themselves as Victorians or Queenslanders or New South Welshmen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also widely believed that we did not have the discipline necessary to build and deploy a national army. In fact, Australians regarded themselves as inferior and second-rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gallantry of the Anzac troops&mdash;nine Victoria Crosses were awarded&mdash;is not alone enough to explain the overwhelming sense of national identity that Gallipoli engendered.

There is no sense in which we should diminish the quality of the supreme sacrifice, whether it was at Gallipoli, the Western Front, the deserts of Sinai or the jungles of Vietnam.

The first point in the statement, which I bring to the attention of honourable members, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tibet was a separate, independent and sovereign nation prior to its invasion and subsequent occupation by the People's Republic of China.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something that, from time to time, has been a matter of dispute between the two parties to this discussion. It is one of the stumbling blocks in trying to get both Tibetan and Chinese officials together to have meaningful dialogue. I was interested to have quoted to me a portion of a perpetual treaty which was referred to in the Dalai Lama's autobiography. The treaty, which dates back to AD 821 or AD 822 and is displayed at Jokhang temple in Lhasa, is between the Tibetan and the Chinese people and acknowledges and confers together for the alliance of their kingdoms. At that time the Great King of Tibet and the Great King of China, being in the relation of nephew and uncle, put together this alliance. The quote from the treaty as set out in the autobiography states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have made and ratified a great agreement. Gods and men will know it and bear witness so that it may never be changed; and an account of the agreement has been engraved on this stone pillar to inform future ages and generations.</PARA>
<PARA>In part, the treaty says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tibet and China shall abide by the frontiers of which they are now in occupation. All to the east is the country of great China and all to the west is, without question, the country of great Tibet. Henceforth on neither side shall there be waging of war nor seizing of territory. If any person incurs suspicion he shall be arrested, his business shall be inquired into and he shall be escorted back. Now that the two kingdoms have been allied by this great treaty, it is necessary that messages should once again be sent by the old route to maintain communications and carry the exchange of friendly messages regarding the harmonious relations.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, as we know, some 40 years ago, the Chinese entered Tibet and, since that time, have occupied what they now refer to as the Tibetan autonomous region. The other aspect that the New Delhi statement goes to has been the great deal of population transfer that has been carried out by the Chinese. Part 4 of the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chinese policies in Tibet, through official incentives, have encouraged the settlement there of 7.5 million ethnic Chinese designed to marginalise the six million Tibetan people.</PARA>
<PARA>Part 5 of the statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major areas of eastern Tibet and north-eastern Tibet have already become dominated by ethnic Chinese. The consequences of the massive influx of Chinese people is becoming clear in central Tibet. For example, of the 12227 shops in Lhasa (excluding the Barkhor areas) only 300 are now owned by Tibetans.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement outlines various reports from parliamentary delegations, including this parliament and the European parliament and reports of independent international human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International and Asia Watch, which have confirmed the continued abuse of Tibetan human rights and denial of fundamental freedoms by the Chinese authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement acknowledges that His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile have, over the years, proposed constructive initiatives to solve the Tibetan problem peacefully. Part 9 of the statement indicates that the permanent tribunal people's session on Tibet in 1992, the international lawyers conference in Tibet in 1993 and the conference of European parliamentarians on Tibet in 1993 have each confirmed the right to self-determination of the Tibetan people enjoyed by them under international law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">China's destruction of the Tibetan environment through indiscriminate deforestation and mining is leading to ecological imbalance with potential consequences affecting nearly half of the world's population.</PARA>
<PARA>When I had the opportunity back in 1988 to speak in this place on a similar motion, I found that one of the most disturbing actions of the Chinese government in Tibet. In the action items of the statement, part 2 expresses concern `at the continued maintenance of Chinese nuclear installations in Tibet and reports of the conduct of the testing of nuclear weapons and the alleged dumping of nuclear wastes'. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two main concerns that I bring before the parliament in speaking to this motion. One is the continued reference to human rights violations that have been well documented and that continue to be well documented. The year 1994 has been proclaimed by the Tibetan government-in-exile as the international year of Tibetan women. The April-May 1994 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tibetan News</EMPHASIS> quotes an interview with a representative from the Australia-Tibet Council and four nuns who have had to flee Tibet through Nepal to Dharamsala in India because of the types of religious persecution that continue to be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes the discussions and debates that have occurred in this place have not touched directly upon the question of independence, which is the stumbling point. What they have touched upon is that one of the basic rights of Tibetan people is that they be allowed to be involved in self-determination and to enter into peaceful protest about the issue of independence. This clearly has not been the case since 1949 and the occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Late last year, as the leader of the parliamentary delegation to the Indian subcontinent, whilst we were in Delhi we were able to meet with people at the central Tibetan administration, including the Vice-Chairman of the Assembly of Tibetan People's Deputies. We were able to have discussions about the progress of representations with the Chinese government, or should I say at that stage and still now, the lack of progress. We are encouraged through this motion and the continuing activity arising out of the Delhi conference that parliaments throughout the world should use their power and influence to sit down with the Chinese government to try to encourage them, as we see the changes throughout the world, to fulfil their obligation to at least address some of the issues that are being raised and identified and allow for independent inquiry of those things so that the Tibetan people can be seen to have the basic human rights that have been denied them returned to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion. Before I start I would like to acknowledge, if my eyes do not deceive me, that the representative of the Dalai Lama and the People's Republic of Tibet and government-in-exile in Tibet is in the gallery with us today. It seems to me that on most occasions when one rises in this place it will inevitably be to address matters of important domestic concern. Probably that is quite rightly the case. As members of a democratically elected parliament, our major concern and priority must continue to be how best to serve our electorates and our nation, particularly the communities we represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a multitude of social and economic domestic issues arise and various interest groups jostle and compete for priority and attention for their particular issues and matters that worry and give them concern, we can sometimes be in danger of forgetting some of the bigger issues in the world. Just as we have rights and responsibilities as representatives of Australian citizens, so too do we have obligations according to our global citizenship. It is in this context that I rise today and support the motion of the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), which was delivered on his behalf by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins); that is, that this parliament accept the New Delhi statement on Tibetan freedom, a statement flowing from the World Parliamentarians Convention on Tibet which was held in New Delhi between 18 and 20 March this year. That New Delhi convention, as we have heard, received parliamentary representatives from 25 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important, I believe, that emphasis be given to the international context which underpins this motion, for sustained pressure from the international community is paramount if ever a peaceful solution to the unwanted Chinese occupation of Tibet is to be found. We must always maintain the hope that a solution is indeed possible, as noted, I believe, by the chief organiser of the convention, Mr George Fernandes MP, in his welcoming address. He said that, if the Israelis and Palestinians could finally sit across a table and find a solution, there is every reason to believe that Tibetan freedom is indeed possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was honoured to meet the Dalai Lama when he came to this country. I met him not far from this spot, just upstairs in the mural hall. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have been one of those who were also there. The Dalai Lama is indeed a gentle and courageous man who has been carrying on a long and sustained fight in incredibly difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these sorts of situations there are often difficulties for countries like Australia when we start to look at justice in terms of human suffering and human rights in small countries and compare how we stand with our views of some of the bigger neighbours that are causing those difficulties. We often find ourselves looking at whether, as a country, we are concerned about trade or human rights. On one hand, we might be talking about our future long-term relationship with China but, on the other hand, not be impressed with what that country has done in Tibet. There are similar concerns with Indonesia and East Timor; and that has been topical over just this last weekend with the John Pilger program on television. For governments, that can cause a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know for some of the honourable gentlemen opposite, when we have talked about things like East Timor and yet had a lot of other formal relations with that country, Indonesia, it has caused some problem. But it seems to me that ultimately we come to the point where we cannot put dollars before human rights. So it is important that we stand up to be counted on these issues. I am sometimes tempted to think the Dalai Lama is not dissimilar to Gandhi in terms of his peaceful approach to the problems besetting his country. But, of course, Gandhi had one particular advantage that the Dalai Lama does not have, and that was tens of millions of population. A peaceful demonstration by tens of millions tends to have more impact than just a handful of millions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue of which Australia needs to be aware when we stand up and talk about our concerns in other people's countries is that sometimes we run the risk of having the finger pointed at us with the way we treat our indigenous people and some of the human rights they do not really receive in full measure. That is all the more reason, if we want to talk about what happens elsewhere, that we need to do something about our own indigenous population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also perhaps worthy of note to look at the world action that took place in that international conflict in the Gulf War not so very long ago, and the world's inaction when it comes to the issue of China and Tibet. Whilst the invasion and occupation in 1949 of Tibet by communist China and the subsequent campaign by Tibetans to re-establish their freedom and sovereign right are all well documented, of course, I would like to point out some highlights of various aspects of the struggle which I think are noteworthy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as with any form of human rights abuse, the particular human rights abuses being carried out against Tibetans by the Chinese regime are to be condemned by the international community. Let us make no mistake that such actions do indeed constitute very real abuses of human rights. For example, they take the form of enforced assimilation through population transfer. That is not taking the Tibetans out; that is shipping Chinese nationals into Tibet. We have seen something like 7.6 million Chinese moved into the country, which now completely swamps the six million Tibetans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is racial discrimination in employment, accommodation and education. For example, 60 per cent of places in schools are reserved for Chinese. There is confiscation of Tibetan land. There is coerced sterilisation of Tibetan women. If Tibetans produce more than two children, they incur a fine and their citizenship is withdrawn. The withdrawal of citizenship means that they lose their identity papers, their ration cards, their kids cannot go to school and they are not allowed to work. There is no freedom of expression. Instead&mdash;and the authority for this is a well-respected organisation called Amnesty International&mdash;harassment, arbitrary detention and torture are commonplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to draw to the attention of the House the words of the Dalai Lama. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our struggle is not an ideological one . . . Tibetans do not oppose reforms, communism and changes. We don't harbour ill-feeling against the Chinese people as such. We are fighting for our rights against the illegal occupation of our country by an alien force.</PARA>
<PARA>This dignified and tolerant response by one of the world's truly great leaders comes after, mark my words, 44 years in exile, the death of over 1.2 million fellow countrymen, the destruction of more than 6,000 monasteries and historical sites and years of continuous and systematic population transfer of ethnic Chinese into Tibet leading to a situation that I mentioned before where Tibetans are now a minority in their own land. It seems to me that we in the Western world have much to learn from the Dalai Lama about human tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is clear that a conciliatory, non-violent approach has been pursued by the Tibetan government in exile in its dealings with the Chinese government. In accepting Deng Xiaoping's statement in 1979, after 20 years of no contact, that all things `except for the independence of Tibet' are negotiable, Tibetans have expressed their willingness to try to come to some agreement by putting forward suggested solutions within this criterion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in spite of this overwhelmingly generous concession in relation to independence, China has refused to play ball. Instead, Chinese authorities have undertaken to continue their population transfer and their assimilationist policies and to use international forums to publicise China's `claim' to Tibet. Therefore, it is imperative that we, as global citizens, do everything in our power to bring pressure to bear in support of freedom for Tibet. There could be no ideal more worthy of our support than that of independent democratic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, I would like to pay tribute to the Indian government because I believe that its continuing assistance to the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been absolutely crucial. That support has been extensive and often under extremely difficult conditions and circumstances in its own relationships with China. In conclusion, I commend the honourable members for McEwen and Scullin for bringing this motion forward. I think we have to stand up and be counted on human rights issues regardless of any embarrassments for governments. There is a clear situation in Tibet of abuse of human rights by China and a clear case of removal of Tibet's own sovereignty. These actions are to be condemned. I urge the House to strongly support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1986 I visited Tibet. I believe that at that time I was one of the very few members of this House ever to have had the opportunity and pleasure of going there. I went there in my capacity as a member of parliament and I think I was also the first Australian member of parliament to visit there. I visited Lhasa, Xigaze and other areas of Tibet. The friendliness and openness of the people is something I really did not expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had been in China for a week or two before I flew into Lhasa. The view we saw when we landed at Lhasa airport, which is 30-odd miles from the city of Lhasa, was quite outstanding. From the airport we travelled along a long valley and took a right-hand turn, and away in the distance was Potala Palace. It is quite magnificent, and I can assure the House that it is an impression that will last with me forever. Back in 1986, there were huge numbers of Chinese people in Lhasa itself. Tibetan people, even then, were outnumbered by the Chinese&mdash;a lot of whom had been transported in there to build up the hotels and the infrastructure around the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will never forget one of the hotels at Xigaze. It was a huge hotel with a huge foyer of green marble. It was very impressive. We were on the third floor and as there were no lifts we had to walk up the stairs. In the very thin air it was very hard to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Tibet is having some little problems as it tries to cope with an influx of visitors who want to have a look at this beautiful country and with the way the Chinese have virtually overrun it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should all look up to the Dalai Lama, and all our leaders should make certain that they take a leaf out of his book. He won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the problem of restoring Tibet's freedom to a truly autonomous region. When asked why he was not hard line and why he did not promote violence, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite often they say, `The Chinese know only force.' It's not a generational matter. There are many, many elder Tibetans who think violence is the ultimate answer, too. Sometimes, perhaps, I think among the younger generation, there is more attraction towards Yasser Arafat or the mujihadeen in Afghanistan. They often tell me, `Oh, look at them. Through violence, there is more publicity, more support from the outside world'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fundamental belief is that human nature lies in gentleness. Human nature is compassionate, is affectionate. Therefore, using violence is against human nature.</PARA>

So in order to live in a friendly, peaceful and neighbourly way, while we are carrying out this freedom struggle, we must pursue non-violence, so that our struggle will not affect our long, long friendship.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe there is any other leader in this world today who would have said those words. Even after all of the terrible things that have happened in Tibet, this man is certainly someone from whom, as I have said before, all of us can learn a great deal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In May 1993 communist Chinese authorities adopted the following dual strategy in an attempt to suppress Tibetan resistance: firstly, to transfer even greater numbers of Chinese into Tibet in order to make it demographically impossible for Tibetans to continue to oppose Chinese occupation; and, secondly, to manipulate important international Tibet supporters and Tibetan religious persons and to infiltrate religious institutions in order to publicise China's claim to Tibet and to create discord in the Tibetan movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tibetan people are understandably distressed by the increasing threat to their culture and civilisation.

Tibetans will also disagree with the account of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Unfortunately, while many nations and ethnic groups would like to be in a position to resolve their own affairs, they are not, and therefore need the support and encouragement of others, such as the members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tibetans have not had the attention of the international media which has been bestowed on other global hot spots such as Kuwait and Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is partly because of the control of communist China. Also, unlike Kuwait, Tibet has no oil and, unlike European countries, Tibet is perceived as being of no strategic importance to the major world powers. It is a tragedy when those considerations determine whether or not the people of a particular nation get a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tibet lies at the centre of Asia, or the roof of the world, on a mountain plain at the back of the Himalayas. In 1949 communist China invaded Tibet and the Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 when he was aged 24. The spiritual leader of Tibet and Nobel Peace Prize winner visited Australia in 1992 and impressed many with his dignity and wisdom. The Dalai Lama has declared his willingness to enter into negotiations with Chinese officials and has put forward proposals which fall within the framework for negotiations proposed by Deng Xiaoping; however, China has refused to enter into discussion. It always seems to be a question of China moving the goalposts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other members of this House, I am well aware of China's economic significance in the world and of the importance of building our relationship with China; however, we cannot ignore the facts of what has happened in Tibet. The facts are that, in close to 40 years of Chinese occupation, the Tibetan people have suffered brutal and barbaric treatment. Amnesty International documents many reports of inhumanities which have occurred in Tibet and it is estimated that more than 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed. The autobiography of the Dalai Lama, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freedom in Exile</EMPHASIS>, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The methods the Chinese used to intimidate the population were so abhorrent that they were almost beyond the capacity of my imagination. It was not until I read the report published in 1959 by the International Commission of Jurists that I fully accepted what I had heard: crucifixion, vivisection, disembowelling, dismemberment of victims was commonplace. So too was beheading, burning, beating to death and burying alive, not to mention dragging people behind galloping horses until they died or hanging them upside down and throwing them bound hand and foot into icy water. And, in order to prevent them shouting "Long live the Dalai Lama" on their way to execution, they tore out their tongues with meat hooks.</PARA>

There has been an attempt by a number of governments throughout the world and by various bodies at the United Nations to try to raise with the present government of the People's Republic of China the situation with respect to the Tibetan people and their continuing oppression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is indicative of this point that this convention of world parliamentarians on Tibet was held in New Delhi, India. At that meeting a statement was formulated which contains some very important clauses. I understand the statement has been tabled but, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will refer to a couple of key clauses. It is sad that the government of China is continuing a policy which involves an attempt to undermine and destroy the culture and traditions of the Tibetan people. This is quite an intolerable and an unacceptable situation and one which has to be reversed. Clause 4 of the statement states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chinese policies in Tibet, through official incentives, have encouraged the settlement there of 7.5 million ethnic Chinese designed to marginalise the six million Tibetan people, destroy the traditional Tibetan landscape, and threaten the Tibetan people's distinct national, cultural and religious identity.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that a people threatened by these kinds of manoeuvres would, in previous times, have rebelled in a very violent fashion. But if we look at the long history and traditions of the Tibetan people, especially at that advanced luminary of Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, we can see why he has continued to insist on peaceful and non-violent forms of protest in relation to what has happened to his people. It is in this sense that two paragraphs of the resolution agreed to by the convention should be emphasised. Paragraph (iii) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Support the non-violent efforts of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile to solve the Tibetan problem, particularly the Dalai Lama's campaign to make Tibet a zone of Ahimsa (non-violence) through demilitarisation, protection of Tibet's natural environment and the commencement of earnest negotiations between Tibetan and Chinese representatives on the future of Tibet.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (iv) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Urge the Chinese Government to respond positively to the above initiatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government-in-Exile for negotiations without preconditions to solve the Tibetan problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The very advanced religious tradition of Buddhism of the Tibetan people has, in a sense, embedded into national consciousness the idea that non-violence is the way to proceed. For that reason the Tibetan people have not resorted to an armed struggle to try to achieve their self-determination and freedom. But that does not mean that the international community should ignore the plight of the Tibetan people. The fact that there is no armed struggle does not mean that the Tibetan people are not oppressed, especially if we understand the reports of Amnesty International and other bodies about the level of oppression, torture and of judicial killing in Tibet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Born in England in 1917, he came from a distinguished family, a family that was no stranger to politics. Let me dwell on different aspects of that contribution. His grandfathers were in the first Australian federal parliament. David Fairbairn's uncle James was not only Minister for Air but a leader of a key delegation to the Ottawa conference in the build-up to World War II. It is noteworthy that that tragic accident took out not only James Fairbairn, then Minister for Air, but also Brigadier Street, father of Tony Street, and Vice-President of the Executive Council, Sir Henry Gullett, father of Joe Gullett, and the Chief of the General Staff at the time, General Sir Brudenell White. That air accident in 1940, a very difficult and critical time for Australia, claimed three ministers and a chief of our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fairbairn family played a remarkable role in the development of Australia. Recognised for their contribution socially, pastorally, politically and patriotically, the Fairbairns have been on the land since the middle of last century. The family owned vast properties, not only at Woomargama near Holbrook in Victoria but also in New South Wales and Queensland, in the area of Cappella and Peak Downs. The old Fairbairn homestead has now been shifted into the town of Capella where it forms part of a major tourist exhibition. The Fairbairn Dam, just near Emerald, was named after the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others have mentioned pioneering work of the family with frozen meat and the like, so I will not dwell on that other than to point out that his uncle Stephen was famous for revolutionising the technique of English rowing while studying at Cambridge, although the same Uncle Stephen prided himself as having only ever attended one lecture in the six years he was at Cambridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir David served in the Light Horse, enlisted in the RAAF, served in England and New Guinea and was badly wounded, awarded a DFC and discharged in 1945. He never really spoke much about that. It is a great pity that so many of our wonderful World War II service personnel are reluctant to pass on much of what they saw in that service, as that service is of great historic importance to Australia and part of our history. I regret that is so but it was part of his approach, dominated as it was by humility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn's 25 years as a member of the House of Representatives was served with great honour, great determination and great dedication in all those portfolios, including national development, where he played a key role in selecting the site for the mighty Dartmouth Dam, which has done so much for the Murray-Darling Basin. He retired from federal politics in 1975 and described it as `a very good innings'. Only a week ago we were speaking on a condolence motion for the first member for Bennelong, Sir John Kramer. Both men were true blue Liberals. Both shared a sense of special honour in public duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn was a man driven by his sense of duty and committed to improving the present and planning for the future for all Australians. To dwell on another different aspect, I consider one of his greatest contributions was his role as secretary of a parliamentary committee chaired by that controversial and colourful figure William Charles Wentworth, now a resident of Far North Queensland, which recommended standardisation of the rail gauge system on the key routes Sydney to Melbourne, Sydney to Perth and elsewhere. I often spoke to David about that work. It was manifestly important work in starting to get the rail equation right in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Standardisation was completed in the 1960s but so narrow was the majority after the 1961 election that both David and Bill Wentworth had to travel by taxi after the parliament got up in Canberra across to Yass to jump on the inaugural <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Southern Aurora</EMPHASIS> train, the first ever train to run from Sydney to Melbourne. But they made it, and they made a very big contribution to the modernisation of our rail system at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn was at all times a proud federalist, believing in the rights and significance of state governments and was outspoken against any moves to further centralise power in Canberra. David Fairbairn was a man who truly represented the people of his electorate. Their concerns were his concerns, as reflected in his maiden speech in 1950, which particularly made reference to the supply of basic amenities such as electricity and water, both of which arrived in the town of Boree Creek in his first few years as our federal member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Fairbairn recognised regional development and decentralisation as important aspects for the future of Australia and was concerned about demographic trends in Australia. Federal politics were certainly in his blood and, when the quiet man spoke, he did not mince his words. David Fairbairn described the difficulty he went through to come to his reluctant decision to take on the then Leader of the Liberal Party, John Grey Gorton. But he was driven to do what he thought was best for the party, the government and the nation, and to forgo ministerial rank in the process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in the remarks made about the late Sir David Fairbairn and endorse the motion moved by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and supported by my colleagues. I think anyone who knew David could not but help be marked by the quality and sincerity of the man. Of him perhaps more than most others, the characteristics of belief in what he did and complete devotion to the cause were immediately apparent. As one who worked with him in cabinet, there are two events I really want to refer to, as I believe they are worth remembering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was he, rather than any other of the Menzies ministry, who was responsible for finally deciding, not at that time but later, that there should be funding federally of the Ord River Dam. It was a project that had been spoken and thought about for years, but it was David who, as Minister for National Development, ultimately was the minister responsible and who took that project through cabinet. While it was a matter at that time of some controversy, without doubt it was a project which in this the driest of all continents was worth while. I think it is quite fitting that Fairbairn Dam near Emerald in Queensland, which was named after his family perhaps rather than David himself, bears his name, for throughout his life David was a very great advocate of the need to improve the resources of outback Australia and certainly the availability of water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second event relates really to his attitude which led to his dispute with John Gorton. That was really a product of John Gorton's firm commitment to the declaration of the three-mile limit of offshore mineral resources for the Commonwealth. David was a great federalist and he quite strongly believed that it was inappropriate for the Commonwealth to assert its authority and leave it for the High Court to resolve the difference between the Commonwealth and the states. It was on that matter of principle that he and John Gorton fell out. Yet, in so many ways, they were similar: they each had university degrees, one from Oxford and the other from Cambridge in the United Kingdom, and both were distinguished aviators during World War II. However, David always felt that John was far too much of a centralist and it was very much on that matter of principle that he declared his hand and, of course, contested the leadership of the Liberal Party against John Gorton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To Lady Fairbairn: Ruth, you have every reason to be proud of the contribution your husband made to the parliament, to the Liberal Party and to Australia. In every way he was a great man. He served Australia with distinction during World War II and he certainly served this parliament with very great distinction and subsequently as Australia's Ambassador to the Netherlands. He is a person whom I regarded as a friend and as a person who certainly gave me great guidance in the days when I first became a minister. To Ruth, Frankie, Paulie and Rosie, my Rosie and I extend our deepest sympathy. </PARA>

I grew up in Albury and met Sir David Fairbairn because he was my local member. He encouraged me to become involved in Liberal politics and eventually to run for and enter state parliament. On the rare occasions when I did see him after I was elected, he was always very supportive of me and encouraged me in my work.</PARA></TALK.START>

I served, like the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), in the parliament with David Fairbairn and in ministries in the 1960s and 1970s and was foreign minister when he was Ambassador to the Netherlands. I think honourable members who did not know David will have gained from the remarks that have passed, particularly from the right honourable member for New England and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), just what a fine, quiet and dignified man David Fairbairn was.

When one thinks of David, one thinks of a quintessential traditionalist: the instincts of honour, decency, service, commitment, loyalty and all of those values that people sometimes sneer at and deride but which at the end of the day mean more in the collective life of a nation than some of the more passing, fashionable and seemingly more attractive qualities of men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the deputy leader for his question. The government certainly does not agree with the conclusion suggested by the honourable member. The government has set in place a strategy not only for the current calendar year but also for the years ahead. The government has made firm decisions about that strategy. It has shown not only in this year's budget but also in last year's budget that it is prepared to take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure that that strategy remains on course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget, I think we have seen the government successfully make room for a very substantial package which deals with the issue that most Australians have been concerned about over the last two or three years: unemployment. The measures taken in this statement, together with the overall fiscal strategy, are designed to wind back levels of unemployment to that which will be much more acceptable. That is the key to our strategy and there is no reason at all why that strategy should not be effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been implied, not only in this question but in previous questions from the opposition, that somehow what we need to have is a tighter fiscal strategy and to be reducing expenditure more rapidly and, therefore, by implication, we ought not to be setting the priority in unemployment that the government has set. We reject that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We believe that, when you look not only at what forecasters are saying but also at what business is saying, the government's approach is widely accepted. After all, we are moving into a position of recovery, not in terms of high levels of inflation, but in terms of levels of inflation which are comparable to any time over the last decade, employment growth which is strong and indications that investment is likely to be very much on track with the government's forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one has to ask: why is the opposition returning again and again to question the government's fiscal strategy? Essentially, it is doing it not because it is concerned with priorities that might be set by Westpac or by itself, but because of a preoccupation with a lower deficit, irrespective of what the consequences might be for employment and creating a fairer society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government rejects the conclusion of the honourable member for Higgins. We will continue to work to achieve jobs. Last year we created 250,000 jobs. We will work in terms not only of that strategy, but also in a way that has the broad support of business, that will achieve investment, protect low inflation and ensure a fairer society.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The predictions of the Business Council of Australia are merely one of the many forecasts which are in opposition to the opposition's forecasts on the direction of investment. Sixty per cent of the council's survey respondents expected to increase their investment by more than 10 per cent, and about 45 per cent of survey respondents expected to increase their investment by more than 20 per cent. The survey found that 46 of Australia's 86 largest corporations also expected the value and volume of their sales to rise. The survey found that uncertainty associated with investment is diminishing and that excess capacity is falling. Some businesses have reached full capacity. Productivity growth with respect to both capital and labour has been strong in the six months to 31 March 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Salmon, who is on the BCA board and who is also the Managing Director of AMP, said in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that `business in Australia expects economic recovery to accelerate without the threat of a resurgence of high inflation'. Taken together with the national account figures for the March quarter, the survey suggests that the 1994-95 Commonwealth budget framework and its forecasts are attainable. So increased investment will expand the economy's productive capacity and help sustain strong economic growth, which in turn will support employment growth. Improved productivity flowing from workplace reforms also improves the economy's effective capacity to produce goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that is of a piece with what the last set of national accounts showed, but what we have flowing through here is a higher quality recovery, even though the way in which the bureau collects its statistics always makes it likely that it is going to underestimate, or not necessarily identify, the early stages of a business investment surge. But what it did correctly identify was that the increased investment and the very good growth figures were taking place against the background of a maintenance of low inflation&mdash;indeed, declining inflation&mdash;and against the background of very substantial improvements in productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of those two elements, low inflation and the very substantial improvements in productivity, is what will ensure that the climate for business, including the interest rate regime, is going to be acceptable for the foreseeable future.

The honourable member for Mackellar said in interviews with newspapers around this country that she was `the one who would make this an important priority'. She said that on Thursday of last week. Over the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition said that she is not responsible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Scullin for his question. As the honourable member points out, the government is concerned to maximise the scope for unemployed people to make their own choices and to take their own decisions in seeking options to maximise their chances of getting back into work. This goal is perceived by the government as being integral to the white paper measures&mdash;not just the social security measures but also the job compact which, as honourable members would be aware, provides scope for unemployed people to make their own choices as to who is going to case manage them so as not to be strictly confined to the CES.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to speak mainly about some changes in the social security income support system for unemployed people which also further this goal of maximising the capacity of unemployed people to control their own futures, to make their own decisions and choices. A number of specific measures were taken in pursuit of that objective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the range of activities that the long-term unemployed and those at risk of long-term unemployment can undertake while in receipt of benefit will be significantly expanded. This expansion will cover self-employment initiatives, participation in community based cooperatives for up to 12 months, training options, voluntary work and cultural activities. A considerably broader range of activities will now be permissible under the activity agreements that unemployed people will enter into. They will, of course, have to be subject to agreement by the person's individual case manager, so it is not an absolute free-for-all, but there is a considerable broadening of the scope and range of activities that are permissible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, those people who have been unemployed for more than three months will have the option of receiving a capitalisation or lump sum payment advance on their allowance of up to $500. The long-term unemployed and those at risk of long-term unemployment will be able to get an advance of up to $1,000 for an approved purpose to help their labour market prospects. No interest will be charged on these advances which will be repaid in a manner akin to normal social security overpayments. The purpose there is to start to give unemployed people entitled to an allowance some capacity to shape and manipulate the form in which they take that allowance so that they are in control to a greater extent and able to utilise that entitlement more effectively to maximise their job search activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point is that, in the broad overarching restructuring of income support, we have moved to eliminate poverty traps which, to a considerable extent, constrain the capacity of unemployed people to take up workshop options or to maximise their casual work. This point about poverty traps is very important. There seems to be minimal understanding by the opposition of what a poverty trap is. It is clear from comments by the Leader of the National Party that he would not know a poverty trap from a bar of soap.

In 1993 Australia recorded its lowest number of industrial disputes since 1942, according to the ABS figures last year. The number of working days lost due to disputes in 1993 was 32 per cent below the level for 1992 and the lowest number for a calendar year since 1963. On another measure, the figure of 108 working days lost per 1,000 employees is the lowest calendar year figure since this measure was introduced in the ABS in 1967.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose that the area of family policy is an area that I, like the opposition, take an interest in. It is important that both government and opposition should take a very keen interest in family policy. That is why the question, no doubt, is of universal interest to the parliament. We are all concerned about families. This year the government is investing something like $7 billion into assistance for families. Our approach to families is based on a social policy which we have reconciled with economic policy by ensuring that our policy is well targeted, that it is adequate and that it contains within it, as the Minister for Social Security said, the right work incentives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system of family support we have in this country is certainly as good as any in the OECD and one of the best in the world. Since we came to office in 1983, the government has dramatically increased the value of family payments to low income families with young children by 80 per cent and to families with teenagers by 150 per cent. What does it actually mean? It means an increase for low income families of the order of $20 a week and an increase for families with teenagers of $33 a week per child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has indexed all family payments for the first time in Australian history. We extended rent assistance to low income families for the first time in 1987. We funded more than 220,000 child-care places with a fivefold increase. We have given the poorest 10 per cent of households of low income people across health and community services the value of $67 per household per week. This is largely due to Medicare, and we remember that the opposition had very grave doubts about Medicare and wanted to dismantle it at the last election. We introduced the child-care rebate and the home child-care allowance&mdash;election promises we met. We introduced in the white paper the parenting allowance, and we will develop a new maternity allowance as part of the landmark wage deal struck with the ACTU last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time there will be debates in this parliament about the questions of relative income distribution, poverty and inequality. Clearly those questions are not easy; they are complex. But I commend to the opposition a paper released a couple of weeks ago by Professor Ann Harding, Director of the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling. Dr Harding reports that since January 1990 measures such as the 33 per cent increase in additional family payments for young children and the 72 per cent increase in assistance for those with three or more children have had a very great impact. Poverty rates for sole parents appear to have fallen sharply since 1990, four years ago, by 20 to 30 percentage points. These are due to improvements in social security payments and the child support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I itemise those changes because together they represent a very significant, if not radical, change in family policy. They were achieved, including those quite massive increases in child payments, within an economic policy and in times of very great economic restraint. They result in a commitment to families which has meant that the government has provided the greatest support and assistance to the poorest and the most disadvantaged. They have been achieved to provide the right incentive structure. They have been directed to reduce poverty and unemployment, as far as sole parents are concerned, in what everyone agrees is the most needy group&mdash;the group that requires the greatest assistance and support.

It gets down to a question of detail, a question of policy rigour and a question of being able to put together the discipline that is involved in a commitment to families, particularly the lowest income families, over a very substantial period. In an interview following the last election the then Leader of the Opposition made the point about the Fightback policies that he thought they were `intellectually right at the last election'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I have a question for you which relates to standing order 150 and it is in two parts. My question relates to question No. 313, which has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> since 30 August last year. It was directed to the Treasurer and it relates to part-time and casual employees and superannuation. On 22 March, I asked the Acting Speaker whether under standing order 150 he would write to the Treasurer and seek a reason why the Treasurer would not answer the question. On 3 May, I raised the same point with you and you again said that you would write to the Treasurer and ask him to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two concerns. Firstly, it seems that under standing order 150 it is all very well for you to write but the ministers are apparently not bothering to respond&mdash;if they are responding, will you make that response public? Secondly, it would appear, given an announcement on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, that this is another example of the executive ignoring the parliament. The Treasurer has made an announcement relating to this matter before he has bothered to answer the question that was put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> in August last year.</PARA>

With regard to standing order 150, the honourable member has rightly pointed out that when such an issue is raised by a member in this place it is my responsibility to write to the minister concerned seeking reasons for the delay in answering. I do that when requested to do so and when it is raised in the appropriate manner in this place. When that response is forthcoming that is also directed to the relevant member.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I wish to direct a question to you. On three occasions today ministers were asked questions&mdash;not the dorothy dixers&mdash;from our side of the House and on those three occasions they were simply unable to answer the questions at all. I know it is embarrassing for those opposite. I also draw your attention to the fact that question time on the government side now operates on the basis of a roster system. Yet, despite the roster system and therefore the substantial reduction in the number of ministers who appear at question time, today not only is the Prime Minister absent&mdash;for understandable and perfectly acceptable reasons&mdash;but the Minister for Employment, Education and Training is absent, the Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations is absent, and in the course of this week the Deputy Prime Minister is going to be absent and in another place the Minister for Foreign Affairs is going to be absent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the guardian of the interests of this House, could you please ensure, firstly, that government ministers are properly briefed before they attend question time in order to answer questions and, secondly, that at the very least those ministers who are on the roster to turn up to question time do turn up or else additional ministers be found to fill the places of those who will not turn up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the second issue, the question of rostering of ministers is canvassed in the standing and sessional orders and is a matter for the government. Perhaps that particular question might be directed to the Leader of the House. With regard to the first matter which the honourable member raised, the Speaker is responsible for administering the standing and sessional orders so that when a question is asked of a minister a minister responds. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, the content of that response is covered also by precedence and standing and sessional orders. I have remarked on this before in this place. Whether a fulsome answer or an answer which the questioner has asked is responded to appropriately in the questioner's view is a matter for debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have recently changed portfolio in the new opposition arrangements, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the debate today to offer some reflections on the role of science and technology, my former portfolio responsibility, for the future of Australia. In particular, given my new portfolio responsibilities, I want to draw the attention of the House to the consequences for employment and Australia's families of the government's abject failure to develop any clear, long-term strategic approach to science and technology in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Science and technology expresses a key element of the vision that the coalition has for Australia's future. This vision is of an Australia which builds on its outstanding capacity in science and technology and on the highly enterprising national character that Australians have to reassert its role as major player in the expansion of trade and industry and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Science and technology must be a driving force of change in this generation if we are to set ourselves the goal of once more becoming one of the top 10 nations of the world in terms of GDP per capita. Achieving this is crucial to dealing effectively with Australia's unacceptable levels of unemployment and underemployment. Science and technology is relevant to all our industry sectors including service industries, the fastest growing sector of world trade. Increasingly, the competitive edge in service industries is determined by technology, particularly information and communications technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although now the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, I had responsibility for science and technology for the last 13 months, a period punctuated by instability in government policy, broken promises and little or no action by the government on the significant problems which are holding back the national effort in this critical area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, science and technology just does not rate in the view of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister, who is not known for his interest in this area, is more concerned about a new constitution for his republic and about changing the flag than he is about developing Australia as a scientifically and technologically advanced nation. As a result, Australia is falling behind the rest of the world in an area that is becoming increasingly vital in terms of national competitive advantage. A recent UNESCO study found that the science and technology effort of countries such as Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan now surpasses that of Australia. A decade ago the Australian industry effort in research and development ranked 17th out of 24 OECD nations. Despite all the government's rhetoric, this remains the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the universities, the government has deliberately ignored the recommendations of the Boston research group and the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to substantially increase resources for declining research infrastructure. This is one of the most serious issues facing Australian science today, and it threatens the world-class quality of Australia's fundamental research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most disheartening aspect of the past year has been the government's treatment of the nation's premier research organisation, the CSIRO. As I said at the National Science Forum earlier this month, the decisions taken in the budget in relation to science agencies are the culmination of one of the most disgraceful episodes in the history of science policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last year saw a minister criticised by leading science organisations and scientists alike, and now discredited. His scheme to break up the CSIRO and establish a new national marine science institute demoralised the organisation and severely affected the national research effort. It saw a complete rejection of proper processes of consultation, broken election promises, a breakdown in the system of triennial funding and&mdash;the final ignominy&mdash;a cut of some $20 million in funding to the CSIRO when compared with the last triennium. All this comes from a government which stated just prior to the last election, `Significant changes and disruption to the way the CSIRO is structured and funded are not on the agenda.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my achievements of which I am most proud during my time in the shadow portfolio was the fact that by our firmness of resolve we in the coalition were able to save the CSIRO from the minister's attacks and stop the organisation being broken up on ministerial whim. As a result of the vigorous opposition we were able to mount in this parliament and in the wider community, the Prime Minister was ultimately forced to remove the former minister for science, Senator Schacht, from his portfolio. The many letters and calls I received from scientists around the country thanking me for the coalition's key role in defending science during this period were greatly appreciated and are a source of particular pride. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all the time I spent as the shadow minister for science, technology and export development was spent in protecting Australia's science base, although we did as much as we could to protect it from the depradations of Senator Schacht and his colleagues. The past 13 months have been a very positive and constructive period in the relations between the coalition and the science community. In particular, I was moved at the recent industry policy workshop by the acknowledgment from Sir Gustav Nossal, as the incoming President of the Australian Academy of Science, of the high profile the coalition was giving to science policy since the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to acknowledge the excellent work of the coalition policy committee on industry, technology and consumer affairs. In particular, I acknowledge the work of the chairman of the committee, Senator Grant Chapman, and the secretary, Senator Brian Gibson. Above all, I want to acknowledge the genuine and full interest in the portfolio from the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who firmly re-established in the science community the priority the coalition has traditionally given to science and technology policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my time in the portfolio, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to view at first-hand the excellent research being conducted by the CSIRO in many of its divisions. In addition, I make special mention of the work being conducted by the Australian Institute of Marine Science in areas such as reef conservation and the development of our mariculture industry, and also by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation in medical and environmental research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most important, however, are the people themselves&mdash;the dedicated scientists, technologists and engineers who have made a disproportionate contribution to world science and whose work has improved the quality of life of all Australians. I have been fortunate enough to meet many of Australia's scientists and would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them all. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Adrienne Clarke, Chairman of the CSIRO; Dr John Stocker, the Chief Executive of the CSIRO; Professor David Craig, the immediate past President of the Australian Academy of Science; Sir Gustav Nossal, the current President of the Australian Academy of Science; Sir Rupert Myers, the President of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering; and Professor Ralph Slatyer, Australia's former chief scientist. These people are worthy leaders of the nation's scientific research</PARA>
<PARA>effort, and as a country we are fortunate indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to pay tribute to the chief executives of the all too few small and medium sized enterprises who have seized the technology challenge and are successfully leading the private sector through their competitiveness into export markets. I am also pleased to note that, with the responsibility transferred to my colleague Senator Hill, science and technology continues as a senior cabinet level post in the opposition. This indicates the top level priority we in the coalition continue to give to science and technology. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to address the issue of the recent Northern Territory election. I want to do so to highlight a number of important issues which I think are relevant to public debate in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the weekend the people of the Northern Territory made a judgment in terms of their political masters for the next four years. They chose to support the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory, as is their right and, in this instance, as is their wont&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that there was a swing towards the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I want to confront&mdash;and that I think the opposition ought to confront&mdash;is the way in which the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party government, led by Chief Minister Marshall Perron, waged a very divisive and quite racist campaign. I know there are members in the opposition who are afraid to confront the unpleasant reality of the way in which this campaign was waged, but I suggest that for successive elections over 20 years the CLP has fostered a mythology over a number of areas which ought to be relevant to the opposition. The CLP says, firstly, that the territory's lifestyle can be safeguarded only by the incumbent government; secondly, that southern influence is the greatest threat to territory lifestyle and that the Commonwealth&mdash;for that, read `the Labor government'&mdash;in Canberra is the greatest impediment to Northern Territory development; and, thirdly, that Labor governments favour the NT Aboriginal community over other territorians and have an agenda to give Aboriginals control of the territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing could be further from the truth. This mythology has been at the heart of every CLP election campaign since self-government, and the campaign just concluded was no exception. The real tragedy of these themes is their basic divisiveness: they set the territory against other parts of Australia and one group of territorians against another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Ronaldson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When these themes are used as a basis for an election campaign, as the CLP has used them in election after election, it is inevitable that such campaigns will operate on the lowest common denominator&mdash;and this was no exception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mr Ronaldson interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IJ4">Mr SNOWDON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will very briefly address the issue that southern influence is the greatest threat to the territory's lifestyle and that the territory's lifestyle can be protected only by the incumbent CLP government. The most obvious point to be made, even to the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), is that 80 per cent of the Northern Territory government's budget revenue comes from taxpayers in Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, the ACT and Tasmania. The fact is that territorians benefit as a result of the fact that the Commonwealth sees fit to provide it with 80 per cent of its revenue, which the territory government claims carriage over and then seeks to spend it as it normally does and to claim within the budget context that those expenditures are its own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most obvious example of this is the claim on electoral material used by the CLP that it has given massive expenditure for Aboriginal housing. I will give the answer. This year's CLP budget has an item which lists $19 million for Aboriginal housing. The Commonwealth budget papers show the $19 million as a specific purpose grant under the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. It is a Commonwealth program; it is not a program of the Northern Territory government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This argument that the CLP government is the protector of this lifestyle is absolutely false. The protector of this very important lifestyle is the Labor government in Canberra. The Labor government in Canberra funds the programs which the Northern Territory government runs. The Labor government in Canberra is responsible for providing both directly and indirectly for the employment of all public servants in the Northern Territory. The Labor government in Canberra is responsible for funding most of the construction activity in Darwin and its environs. The Labor government in Canberra is responsible for funding the Northern Territory University. The Labor government in Canberra is responsible for providing most of the capital works funding which takes place in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I heard my colleague from the Northern Territory the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), this afternoon, in answer to a question in the Senate about the impact of this expenditure, say that, if the defence expenditure which comes from the Commonwealth for the Northern Territory economy were withdrawn, unemployment in the Northern Territory would increase seven times. That is just a basic point. So the lifestyle which is being so-called protected by the CLP is being protected to the extent that the CLP spends money given to it by this Labor government. It uses its discretion about components of that budget. What does it do? The CLP uses it to underwrite its own debt. We might record that it has the highest per capita debt level in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The major purpose of my making this address this afternoon is to raise the issue of the way in which the CLP plays the politics of racial division. Most thinking Australians realise that the only real division in the territory is very simply based on poverty&mdash;the haves versus the have-nots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that one-quarter of the territory's population is Aboriginal and primarily has Third World living conditions. Aboriginal people have the highest unemployment rate, the highest infant mortality rate and the highest morbidity rates in Australia; in fact, Aborigines have the lowest income levels of any group of people in Australia. The same territory government then argues that the Northern Territory CLP government does not and cannot support any concept of social justice or equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have in front of me a copy of the headlines from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper of 18 May. They make it clear that what this election was all about was not lost on those who are commentators in the political scene. One headline reads `The politics of race key to victory'. Another headline states `NT poll opens with race row'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not walk away from it. The Northern Territory CLP government, at every election&mdash;be they local elections in the Northern Territory or federal elections&mdash;for the 20 years that it has been in power has tried to divide the community on the basis of race. This time has been no exception. In a letter addressed to his constituents, the Northern Territory Chief Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Labor policy on Law and Order states that our Police will be directed to treat Aboriginal offenders more leniently than other people.</PARA>
<PARA>Perron's letter went on to claim that the Northern Territory Labor Party also proposed that courts `be more flexible in sentencing Aborigines'. Perron then stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CLP absolutely rejects this concept.</PARA>
<PARA>Why did the CLP government in the Northern Territory accord support for the recommendations of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I will quote a number of those recommendations. Recommendation 86A, which is supported by the Northern Territory government&mdash;the CLP&mdash;states that offensive behaviour during police approaches is not to be the basis of a charge. Recommendation 92 refers to using legislation regarding prison as a last resort. Recommendation 117 deals with legislation regarding automatic imprisonment and not following the breach of community service order. It goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the CLP was seeking to divide the community&mdash;to pit territorians against each other. I have further examples. On another occasion I would seek to table this document, which is a copy of a direct mail letter from the Northern Territory Chief Minister to his constituents. He makes it very clear that the purpose of the CLP's campaign is to divide non-Aboriginal territorians against Aboriginal territorians. I will quote from a television advertisement which was put on by the CLP:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the Labor Party wants to bring in different rules for different people. That is not fair. That is racism. We have a system that works. Why change it?</PARA>
<PARA>I do not apologise for the fact that I support social justice initiatives for Aboriginal territorians. I do not apologise for the fact that we should be addressing the issue of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I do not apologise for wanting to address the health issues confronting Aboriginal territorians. I do not apologise for any of these things. I ask members of the opposition to think about the precedent here. Instead of advocating reconciliation in the Northern Territory community, the CLP sought to divide Aboriginal territorians against non-Aboriginal territorians and vice versa, and territorians against the rest of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week we asserted just how extraordinary and improper the decision to issue mining leases at Shoalwater Bay was. Today I will present to the House Shoalwater scandal documents Nos 9 and 12. Document No. 9 is a letter to Stewart West, then Minister for Administrative Services, who was responsible for the Shoalwater Bay military training area. I will quote from page 2 of that letter:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Graham Richardson.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, former Senator Richardson was driving to have mining leases issued to Mr Laurance. This letter proves that he achieved his goal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) claimed in another place that former Senator Richardson did not issue the leases and that he did. On the face of it, that appears to be correct. However, irrespective of whether it was intentional or unintentional, it is misleading in the extreme. Because of clause 3 of the terms of settlement in the September 1983 case of Murphyores v. Commonwealth of Australia, the matter was taken out of his hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to Shoalwater scandal document No. 12. I will quote clause 3 of the terms of settlement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defendant (the Commonwealth) will abandon all grounds of resistance to the plaintiff's claim of entitlement to the leases . . . other than grounds based on the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974-75.</PARA>
<PARA>The terms of settlement left former Senator Richardson as the sole person able to prevent the proposal from proceeding. Far from preventing it from proceeding, the opposite was the case: he specifically agreed to the issuing of mining leases as per his letter to Stewart West. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Laurance's lawyers on Friday claimed that Mr Laurance does not now own the leases and would not, therefore, benefit from any compensation action. By way of rebuttal, we would first state that, at the time of the decision to issue the leases&mdash;be it at the time of former Senator Richardson's letter to Stewart West on 15 February 1990 or the cabinet submission of July 1990, produced as Shoalwater scandal document No. 4&mdash;either way, Laurance owned the leases when a $100 million plus windfall accrued to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill 1994 has a long history. The report which we were requested to do into this bill poses more questions than it answers. I speak on behalf of the coalition members on that committee. The comments that I make will be my own, not those of the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is apprehensive about the legislation, which is written in the vaguest of terms. Clause 65VE(2) represents the main function of the bill. That clause and the explanatory memorandum presented with the bill do nothing to alleviate our concerns. Goods may be labelled `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia' if Australia is the place of origin of each major ingredient. But the term `major ingredient' is not defined in the legislation or the explanatory memorandum. It is noted that small amounts of imported seasoning and flavourings may be acceptable, but the term `small amounts' is not defined in the legislation. With electronic goods, for example, the smallest components may be the most vital. Throughout the explanatory memorandum and the bill, terms such as `major', `small amounts' and `may be acceptable' are not defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is highly confusing and subject to great variance. Therefore, I believe the most effective way to ascertain how this bill will be administered is to seek information from the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) in the parliament regarding the procedures to be followed and the way the guidelines will be formulated. The coalition has serious reservations about this bill. It will reserve its judgment on the legislation until the minister provides the House with a satisfactory explanation of this bill, particularly this major clause, clause 65VE(2), and its method of implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the question of seasonal supply fluctuations. The committee addressed this question and came up with a recommendation which appears on page 6 of the report. It describes options that are available under the legislation for producers of goods who may be unable to source a major ingredient locally due to seasonal supply fluctuations. Once again, the term `major ingredient' is used in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that this proposal is successful and passes both houses of parliament, I think it is necessary to refer to the third recommendation of the committee's report. Our third recommendation addresses the question of the implementation of this legislation, should it be successful. We believe that a 12-month phase-in period, which was initially proposed in the bill, is insufficient time for manufacturers to make the necessary adjustments to their equipment and machinery. We have suggested that, in order to meet those commitments of origin labelling, the term for the phase-in period should be extended to 18 months. Furthermore, we have suggested that flexibility be introduced so that, where the costs associated with the changes are considered prohibitively expensive, producers will be allowed to seek exemption for a further 12 months after that. That was done in an effort to meet a lot of concerns put forward to the committee by organisations such as the Grocery Manufacturers of Australia and the National Farmers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state and regional references were also addressed by the committee. As is noted on page 7, paragraph 33 of the report, the committee believes that the producers should be able to use a state or regional reference on their label if they believe that this will give them a marketing advantage over other products. That will address a number of concerns regarding regional prospects for a whole range of people, particularly those from Tasmania who had concerns about whether their `Made in Tasmania' label could be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the coalition is far from satisfied with the total contents of the report. However, in an effort to elicit more details for industry, both primary and processing, we will examine in great detail the minister's response before the House. We will reserve judgment on the transition between here and the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this juncture, I would like to thank the staff of the industry, science and technology committee for their help and perseverance. It has been a most difficult task for the committee to try to address at very short notice and in a very short space of time what is an extremely complex issue. But members of the public of Australia are looking for a clear and precise definition of products that are produced in Australia and for products that carry a true representation on the label of where that product is sourced from. I compliment the secretary of the committee, Mr Paul McMahon, and his assistants for their fine work in assisting us with this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I obviously support the overview given by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). I would just like to add a couple of other points. This legislation is another graphic illustration of how the parliament and the community are increasingly being asked to take legislation on trust. They are being asked to accept it, to let it go through and to let it become law, but the detail as to what it might mean is to evolve later by the development of guidelines. I find that process to be somewhat unsatisfactory and in some cases dangerous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is essential reading for all members of parliament. The Trade Practices Amendment (Origin Labelling) Bill is a graphic illustration of how the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) and her department are saying, `We concede that the drafting of the legislation is open to some question as to its exact meaning.' Industry is saying that it does not know what it means either. Industry is asking for guidelines before the House finalises the legislation but, in the minister's view, the guidelines will not be developed until the bill goes through both houses of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone has a common interest in wanting to get the labelling situation right, but clearly there is something that parliament ought to have a look at. Therefore, the work of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, including that of the staff helping the committee, has been very helpful in illustrating that point. It is now up to the minister, who I am sure will accept the challenge gracefully, to explain these things to this House and to clear up all the doubts that have been raised. If the doubts are not cleared up, then obviously the Senate and the House of Representatives will have to take a closer examination of what it might do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the third time that a bill has been referred to an industry, science and technology standing committee of the House of Representatives in the history of Federation. At the same time as this bill has been referred to this House, an inquiry into the same bill is about to proceed in the Senate. There have been some comments made as to whether that is a suitable and appropriate situation. I do not want to make a judgment on it. I want to draw the attention of honourable members to what I believe should be happening; that is, that House of Representatives standing committees should not step back and resile from their interest in developing good legislation for Australia simply because there might be an inquiry going on in the Senate. As a matter of principle, the House has to scrutinise legislation and its committees can help do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, we must be mindful of the fact that, if the Senate is going to inquire into the same legislation as the House of Representatives, there clearly has to be an understanding between both houses as to how it is to be done so that the industry is not asked to make submissions or give evidence twice. All of those things need to be addressed. I take the liberty of asking whether those matters could be put on the record for further deliberation. I certainly look forward to the minister's explanation of her legislation, which I hope will allay the valid concerns of many people of goodwill who want to see good clear law on labelling but who are having difficulty in understanding exactly what it means at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has come up with a working party, which I have to say, is a confab, a great big meeting, of the bureaucracies. It is not an industry committee or a committee of people from industry, business or even consumer groups which put together this bill; it has come from and is of the bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It essentially gives us in Australia the unique position of having a two-stage labelling requirement. One is `Product of Australia' or `Produce of Australia', being a higher quality identifier of goods which are Australian. Basically those are almost all Australian goods. `Made in Australia' has the same meaning and connotation as found by the High Court in examining those cases where people have been brought to trial under the Trade Practices Act and have been found wanting. So the essential qualifier for `Made in Australia' is that goods assume their essential character in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the committee has had the opportunity to examine and report on this issue. I support the committee's report, but I am disappointed that we had not enough time to call substantive witnesses from industry and from broad based Australian consumer groups and consumers. I have asked my wife, my secretaries and my staff whether we really need to know if something is made in Australia and they answered, quite frankly, yes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Just taking up some of the points that have been raised by honourable members, I note the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) talks about this as a product of bureaucracy and then seems to defend the actual process. There is no doubt that we do need proper labelling laws. What is interesting is to put it into context and see that in some ways this is a product of our free trade position. People are now trying to determine where goods come from because they cannot control the production of goods in any other way. So we are left dealing with some intricate labelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that the time given to assess some very serious issues was absolutely ridiculous. For example, the language used gives us some indication of the problems that we experienced. The honourable member for La Trobe says that if it is `Produce of Australia' it is made in Australia. The fact is that it is not made in Australia if it is `Produce of Australia'. If it is `Produce of Australia', it is produce of Australia. `Made in Australia' is a separate category again and takes its character from being processed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How easily we slip into it. That indicates some of the problems we will encounter in these processes. The ACTU's submission had at the heart of its concern the very question that we needed to get `Made in Australia' in the category, as the honourable member for La Trobe actually implied in an almost freudian slip; but it is not going to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We face a whole range of problems with the legislation, but the legislation is absolutely important. I think we have to be a bit tougher. I was a bit concerned during the discussions that maybe some honourable members on this side of the discussion tonight were in a way trying to defend the importers a little bit too much. We need to draw the lines with people importing goods and point out that if goods are imported they need to be categorised accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing wrong with that and there is nothing wrong with our actually having a labelling system that is different from other countries. Do we take our cue from every other country or can we not set the way, as I said in the debate, as we have done on the tariff debate in cutting out tariffs drastically? When we cut the tariffs drastically we all said we were great leaders in our field. I do not think we were leaders; I think we were rather silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point that has been made has been that the time just was not sufficient.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the Senate on passing these two fine amendments to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, which we debated in this House of Representatives for some two hours a couple of weeks ago. On that occasion, we took the opportunity to point out to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) again and again that his use of ILO convention 137 was highly inappropriate in any circumstances, to say nothing of the circumstances on the waterfront today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ILO convention 137 relates to containerisation of the stevedoring industry, containerisation of international shipping. The fact is that the bureaucrats in Geneva at least had some concern about the welfare of waterfront labour and believed that workers should not be totally displaced, totally put out of jobs and lost forever to the work force without some compensation in lieu of losing their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back to a convention which is now some 20 years old, and where containerisation of international shipping has been well and truly accomplished, was a nonsense. The minister knew it was a nonsense. He was trying once again to use the foreign affairs power of the constitution to bring into Australian domestic law a situation which advantaged the unions&mdash;in this case, the unions on the waterfront. It gave the waterfront unions once again the opportunity to have a register. What does a register mean? A register means levies. What do a register and levies in combination mean? They mean precisely that there are jobs for life on the waterfront. That is what we just spent $430 million to dispense with&mdash;registers and fees. We managed, through the waterfront reform process established by the government's long, slow and drawn out process, to finally change employment practices on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a significant increase in productivity, but not a significant improvement in costs on the waterfront and not a significant improvement in charges to users of international freight services. That is disappointing. But this bill is now acceptable, if marginally so, because unfortunately we still have left the minister with the power to stack the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and to use that committee to make changes to the way the waterfront operates on the basis of government directive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me a bit that, if the minister and representatives from the unions decide to force an issue through the committee, they now have the opportunity to do so. But at least the Senate has seen the wisdom of listening to the debate in the House of Representatives and seeing the illogicality&mdash;the total absence of any sense of order&mdash;of continuing to use ILO convention 137 with respect to this piece of Australian domestic legislation. We have now buried the registers&mdash;we hope once and for all. We have now buried the levies. The committee now has the opportunity to dispense with levies but it no longer has the opportunity to raise levies. That is very positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made a strong point. We will debate in this place time and again this government's misuse of the foreign affairs power of the constitution. I recall when we have attempted to debate in this place the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The government both signed and ratified that convention without reference to parliament and without reference to the people of Australia. I can tell the House that there is a great range of individuals and organisations in my electorate and in electorates surrounding La Trobe who are concerned about the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. There are four articles of that convention which, if read independently, will give the bureaucracy the opportunity to tell children that children have all the rights and parents have no rights to bring up their children in the way they wish. </PARA>

We have used it twice this year in this place, both in terms of industrial relations. The first time was the minister's Industrial Relations Reform Act 1994 and the second was this industrial relations bill relating to the waterfront. Use of ILO conventions has now been attempted on two occasions by the government and, unfortunately, has been successful in one. That is subject now to a High Court challenge, and so it should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to Appropriation Bill (No. 1), I wish to refer specifically to the natural disaster relief provisions which are administered by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley). The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has a keen interest in them, as all members of parliament do, particularly because of the number of natural disasters that Australia&mdash;a continent with fire, flood and drought&mdash;unfortunately has to endure too frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 3.110 of budget paper No. 1, a brief explanation is given of `disaster relief payment'. It is a one-off payment available to victims of major disasters if their normal place of residence has been severely damaged and/or they have suffered a significant interruption to their normal source of livelihood as a result of the disaster. It is equivalent to two weeks pension plus AFP and rent assistance at the maximum rate appropriate to the claimant's family circumstances and it disregards income and assets testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January 1994, the government varied the rate of the disaster relief payment for individuals and families affected by the New South Wales bushfires. Victims and voluntary firefighters who lost income for seven days or more were paid the disaster relief payment and were also provided with additional special assistance equal to twice the normal payment. So, in effect, they were provided with three times the normal payment. Under the natural disaster relief arrangements, funding was also provided to the New South Wales government to cover the cost of bushfires. On page 3.252 of budget paper No. 1, further information is given about natural disaster relief. Figures are given to show that, in the year 1993-94, estimated expenditure was $315.7 million and, in the year 1994-95, estimated expenditure was $432.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support strongly the additional payment&mdash;an increase of virtually 200 per cent&mdash;given by the Prime Minister to the New South Wales bushfire victims following those disastrous bushfires. However, I want to raise a matter of grave concern. On 3 October last year, Victoria had the most serious major flood it has had in the last hundred years. This disaster in north-east Victoria was described by the state emergency people as the worst disaster since Ash Wednesday. It impacted on hundreds of householders, families and individuals. Thousands of people were evacuated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, I have been making constant representations to the government seeking additional assistance for those victims. The government has acknowledged my representations and, as a result, the Prime Minister has ordered a review of natural disaster relief which, I am glad to say, is now taking place. Also, backdated payments for people who were out helping others and who did not make their claim for relief will be paid. But the anomaly is that the payments to people who were affected are being made at the old rate&mdash;not at the rate plus 200 per cent, as was given to the bushfire victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From inquiries I have made, most of the bushfire victims were fully insured. Insurance against fire can be obtained at a reasonable rate. Many of the people who received assistance own homes that are worth in excess of a million dollars. The victims of the floods in north-east Victoria got only the fortnightly payment, and not the $2,000-odd that the Prime Minister generously gave to the bushfire victims on behalf of taxpayers. The flood victims had no insurance, because it is almost impossible to get insurance against floods. Many of them are on low incomes and many of them live in quite humble houses. They are still fighting to try to get back on their feet. Houses are still falling off their stumps in the city of Benalla. As the weather changes the buildings dry out. Elderly people and others are suffering illnesses. The whole matter requires a lot of compassion and a lot of urgent action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has seen me and has been very kind. He is now investigating part of my claim. The Minister for Finance is also investigating it. These people have no insurance. They are still suffering. The Prime Minister has made payments to people with full insurance in New South Wales, some of whom own very substantial homes worth a million dollars or more, and he is not prepared at this stage to simply say, `I have not spent all the money I allocated in this last budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was perfectly correct when he said that the last election in particular was an election which this government should have won. Had we not won it, the coalition would have been given the opportunity to come into government and place that last brick on the top of the Empire State Building and claim the edifice as its own construction. The return to office of this government in March last year made it possible for the Australian Labor Party to place that last brick on the top of the Empire State Building and to affirm the construction as being one of this government. It was important to us, and I think it was also important to the whole Australian community.

The coalition and conservative financial commentators were suggesting that it would not be possible for the government to bring it in under $14 billion. We did it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are various matters I wish to comment on in relation to the Department of Administrative Services. The budget papers show that outlays on the department are expected to increase by some $57 million, or 46 per cent, in the financial year 1994-95, to $181 million, before ultimately declining to about $92 million in 1997-98. This is in large part due to the transfer of staff from DAS business units to the so-called staff adjustment program, or SAP.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in forward years reflects the anticipated reduction in the number of staff on this program. There is no doubt that for various reasons some of the DAS's business units have been staffed well beyond levels which are justified in terms of commercial realities. However, in at least one DAS business unit, the Australian Construction Services in New South Wales, the process by which surplus staff were identified, far from being a rational decision making process, was more akin to a pogrom. I am informed that in the ACS in New South Wales, at least one discipline leader was given effectively 14 hours in which to direct and select peer groups, consult with key discipline resources and carry out technical assessments of up to 80 persons, an equivalent of about 10 minutes per person, which is absolutely impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also told that some persons were assessed on their technical and professional ability by managers who were not conversant with the person's particular disciplines and who had no direct knowledge of the person's capabilities. Moreover, I am told that in some cases hearsay and anecdotal evidence was admitted into the assessment process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this occurred in the context of the 1993 budget process overseen by the then minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan. When I asked the senator a question on notice about this procedure, he assured me that the process was fair and equitable. When I asked again about this matter, the current Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) refused to answer it on the grounds that it would divert too much of the department's resources to answering my parliamentary question. The government's handling of the process of staff reduction in this instance has been appalling. The government is trying to prevent scrutiny of the matter through the appropriate parliamentary process, but it is not going to get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter on which I wish to touch is the sale of the Hotel Kurrajong to the Canberra Institute of Technology. This was effected on 1 October 1993. I believe the former Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, deliberately misled the parliament over the value of this Commonwealth asset and entered into a sweetheart deal with the ACT Labor government over its disposal which saw the Commonwealth lose an enormous amount of money. I believe the senator should resign over this issue for having misled the parliament. I want to stress that I am not against the concept of a hotel school for Canberra; far from it. But I certainly have reservations about the economic viability of the proposal in question and I believe the figures which have been quoted by the government now in answers to my questions on notice demonstrate clearly how far we were led astray initially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to parliamentary costs. Again, the cost of the parliament also increases in this budget. Outlays, much of which are borne by the Department of Administrative Services, will rise by some $10 million, or 3.2 per cent, next financial year&mdash;according to the budget papers taking total outlays on federal parliament to $311.4 million. Parliamentary outlays cover services to parliamentarians provided by the parliamentary departments and the Department of Administrative Services. These increases are unnecessary and greater efforts should be made to reduce cost. For example, it could start by cutting the $22.5 million ministerial staff payroll by some $9 million to restore parity with the costs of opposition staff, which are currently only $4.4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On various occasions recently I have been able to demonstrate beyond doubt how the government has grossly overstaffed itself, considerably reducing the staff available to the opposition on a comparative basis. It should also cut down on ridiculous extravagances like the $90,000 paid for the prime ministerial bird prints, double what they were valued at by Christies, not to mention the half a million dollars proposed to be spent on remodelling the front entrance of the Parliamentary Library, which as a result of my representations, I gather, has now been reduced to some $300,000&mdash;some improvement. A huge number of improvements or reductions in costs can be achieved in the parliament, in the Department of Administrative Services and throughout the government. It is simply not realistic for this government to claim that fiscal responsibility somehow or other precludes it from reducing unnecessary expenditure of this nature. </PARA>

The Department of Administrative Services is responsible for the administration of travel allowance and accommodation costs for all sorts of things, including members of parliament, but also, in particular, the republic advisory committee, which travelled around the country at great cost to the taxpayer and held a whole range of public meetings, the result of which was essentially to demonstrate that the people of Australia, at least those who turned up at such meetings, did not want the government's republic. The whole idea of funding a republic advisory committee to the tune of $600,000 is as unfair and biased as if the government had appointed a monarchy advisory committee and put Michael Kirby at the head of it, put Lloyd Waddy on it and paid them $600,000 to go around the countryside spruiking a particular point of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I follow on from some of the observations made by my most illustrious colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott). The Department of Administrative Services is, of course, responsible for national symbols. Any nation worth its salt has national symbols, and Australia is no exception. Our national symbols, which have been developed gradually since the turn of the last century based upon our constitution, the flag, our flora and fauna, the animal life of this nation, go back to the very earliest form of flag&mdash;which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Dr Theophanous) will find in Old Parliament House, if he bothers to go there and have a look&mdash;which dates back to somewhere around 1815. These are all symbols of a nation, of a young people who were seeking to find a degree of unity in this vast land&mdash;a vast land inhabited at that stage by a small group of European colonists based around the seaboard, with the indigenous population in the inland and very little understanding of what the nation as a whole had to offer. But those people over the next 50 to 100 years built up a degree of strength of belief in their own capacity which has led this country forward ever since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, of course, it first came to be seen in an international sense at the landing at Gallipoli. The history of Gallipoli is well known to the parliamentary secretary; he knows the detail of that. But the important thing was that that young nation, represented by its young men, wanted to show the world what Australians could do when they worked together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why national symbols are so important: they are meant to unify a nation not divide it; they are meant to identify the historical process which achieved the Australia that we know today and which, hopefully, will lead us to greatness in the future. It is not something that one is ashamed of; it is not something one locks away in the back cupboard and hopes everybody will forget. We are not talking about a George Orwellian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1984</EMPHASIS> type situation of books being banned and `thoughtspeak' being applied across the land&mdash;although there is a degree of thoughtspeak in Australia today: we are not supposed to be interested in the past unless it is a version of history of which the Labor Party approves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of historians in this country who have different versions of Australian history. That is one of the realities of the historical process, as the parliamentary secretary would be well aware. Each one of half a dozen historians will give us subtly different views on what we see as the facts or the interpretation of the facts of history. Nevertheless, when we talk about national symbols, that is what we are talking about: where Australia came from, and how we want to use those symbols to hold us all together. I would like to go a step further on this, and on this point I will agree. </PARA>

Perhaps we should consider that the rainbow serpent should become one of the national symbols, along with the other national symbols we have in Australia, to achieve the point I made earlier: unity of the nation so that its various constituent parts can see, in those symbolic elements which interpret the past, the capacity to build a common future&mdash;a common future where, irrespective of where people come from, regardless of their nationality and in terms of the past, their one common element is that together they share the future of Australia.

It is a strange sense of nationhood when one takes, as one of the important national symbols, another country's flag and puts it in our flag.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very much an issue of generational change in Australia as one of the great divisions in Australian politics is between younger and older people. Any political party that wants to stay relevant and any government that hopes to be relevant to the electorate must be aware of the way in which Australian values and attitudes are changing. In my electorate there is a high proportion of young people. In speaking to them, I have found that they have no bonds to or memories of Britain. They have no affection or emotion about the Union Jack. Indeed, they wonder why Australia, an independent nation approaching its centenary of Federation, needs to keep another nation's flag as part of its national symbol. So this government should do anything it can to further that debate and to further the views of younger Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlays in this department are entirely appropriate as are any efforts on the part of this government to provoke a debate about constitutional arrangements. Again, any party that hopes to remain relevant and effective in Australia needs to have regard to younger Australians and new arrivals in Australia . My electorate of Werriwa has a high proportion of migrant and ethnic populations. They hold no affection and no values for the British constitutional arrangements. They regard it as quite unusual that Australia would carry the British sovereign as its head of state. My own experience with this goes to the time when, as mayor of Liverpool, I issued the oath and affirmation of allegiance for citizenship ceremonies. People who have come from nations that may have been at war with Britain in years gone by or nations that have no affinity with Britain could only wonder why they needed to take any amount of allegiance to the Queen. </PARA>

It is not maintaining relevance to the way in which the majority of younger Australians look at their country. They are proud of Australia and they are proud of Australian independence. They want that independence reflected in all fashions. They want it reflected in our flag; they do not want to carry the symbol of another nation in our national symbol. They want that feeling of Australian independence and nationhood reflected in all aspects of our constitution. That means they want an Australian and not the resident or sovereign of another nation as our head of state, which I would regard as the ultimate reflection of Australian independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Liberal and National parties had any regard for nationhood, they would agree. How can a nation be independent in the proper sense of nationhood unless it has a head of state who is an Australian citizen determined in some democratic fashion either by the Australian people or the Australian parliament?

The main thing with which we can console ourselves on this side is that the Liberal Party represents the views and values of older Australians and they will fade away over time. On this side of the chamber maintaining relevance and upholding the true importance of Australian independence and nationhood means that we represent the majority of Australians.

We have the highest level of income disparity of any OECD nation and the highest welfare dependency seen in decades.

The Office of the General Counsel&mdash;this is not the General Counsel's fault&mdash;by contrast is forced to adopt the government line. Of course, the government line is that education for citizenship is not so much explaining the rights and duties of Australian citizens but it is more trying to change the attitudes of future Australian citizens by bringing constitutional education into our schools. This is something that we have to be extremely worried about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This variant of education for citizenship is not so much citizenship as it has been understood, but is rather re-education for politically correct citizenship.

Professor Horne's paper talks about the sorts of things young Australians need to know in order to be better citizens. He talks about things like the history of the arbitration commission and the conciliation court. Specific absences from the list of priorities in Professor Horne's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Education for citizenship</EMPHASIS> paper are matters like the Anzacs and the pioneers.

Whereas 94 years ago we were under the British Crown and our Governor-General was an Englishman representing the British government, today we are under the Australian Crown and our Governor-General is always a distinguished Australian representing the Australian people in the Queen's name.

It is opposed to land rights for Australian Aborigines and it is opposed to human rights for certain parts of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support entirely the outlays that have been provided for the Attorney-General's Department to proceed with certain human rights legislation and action in this parliament. The first of those relates to the announcement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 28 May to introduce racial vilification laws to dissuade those who seek to incite violence and hatred against particular groups defined by ethnic origin; that is, the government will be reintroducing those provisions of the Racial Discrimination Legislation Amendment Bill first introduced by the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) during his period as Attorney-General in December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reflects the great Australian tradition and history of social tolerance. It also reflects the great Australian success story in the 1970s and 1980s of the development of a multicultural society that is the envy of other parts of the world. I note with interest the lukewarm reception that the opposition has given this particular provision to outlaw racial vilification. It seems to place more importance on states rights than human rights. The point is, though, that we need national laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, to his great credit the then premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner, a supporter of the constitutional republic, introduced racial vilification laws in New South Wales. This was also done by a Labor government in Western Australia in 1990 and a Labor government in Queensland in 1991. The point is, though, that we should not have racial vilification laws defined just by state boundaries because racial vilification, particularly in the electronic media, obviously spans state boundaries and can affect all parts of the country. We need national laws that are an effective deterrent. I fully support the way in which the Prime Minister has moved decisively on this issue and we will see the legislation coming before the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say as an addendum that there is no free speech in this country that incites racial hatred and violence. One of the points made by the opposition has been that this would be an infringement on the freedom of speech. There is no speech that is free that incites people to racial hatred and violence in a multicultural society such as ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point of support for human rights concerns the action the parliament needs to take regarding the Tasmanian criminal laws which outlaw `sexual intercourse against the course of nature'. It is another instance where the parliamentary Liberal Party has put states rights ahead of human rights. If one does not fit the Liberal Party's stereotype of the family, one does not rate in its thoughts or policies. It is a party very much out of touch with Australian thought and values in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, was ratified by the Fraser government&mdash;a Liberal government&mdash;to its credit, in 1980.

Earlier this year the committee found against Tasmanian criminal laws which `outlaw sexual intercourse against the course of nature'. That was a breach of the covenant. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has declared his intention to act and for the parliament to receive appropriate legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), decreed that the opposition was opposed to the Tasmanian law but would take no action in this parliament.

In this parliament, if we have the power, we have the responsibility to legislate for all Australian citizens, especially those that are discriminated against.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my remarks to the budget of the Attorney-General's Department relating to the provision of grants to marriage education and counselling organisations. Much time has been expended this year on debate about the parameters of family and the objects of family policy. I am reminded at the onset of winter that Ogden Nash once suggested `a family is a unit composed not only of children, but of men, women, an occasional animal and the common cold'. Whether we can agree on a definition of family or not, most would probably agree with Winston Churchill that a family usually starts `with a young man falling in love with a young woman'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the latest ABS statistics indicate that many couples then live together, the majority later marry and most live the conventional family lives that we all recognise. Regrettably, a third of couples will separate over a lifetime, leading to suggestions from time to time that we should make divorce more difficult. It is true that many people later regret their divorce. For others divorce can also be relief from a destructive relationship. It would have been better if these relationships had not resulted in marriage in the first place. This reflection leads me to this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with despair in this International Year of the Family, despite all the rhetoric about the economic and emotional trauma of family breakdown, that the government has only marginally increased the obviously inadequate grants to these organisations. While it has increased funding for family mediation, preventive services still struggle to receive any real recognition. During 1992-93, 109,000 persons attended approved marriage counselling agencies. Yet couples experiencing difficulties in their relationships were told today that they must wait anywhere between eight and 12 weeks to attend a counselling session. As we all know, personal problems cannot wait eight to 12 weeks. How many marriages&mdash;at what cost to the individuals, their children and the community&mdash;dissolve because of inadequate funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite findings from the Australian Institute of Family Studies that every dollar spent on counselling saved the Commonwealth $7 elsewhere, this funding remains totally inadequate. Similarly, the funding of marriage education is almost non-existent&mdash;a miserly $1.2 million, or about $10 per marriage&mdash;when separation and divorce cost this nation some $3,000 million annually. Despite an Australian study two years ago which found that five per cent of couples either postponed or cancelled their wedding after attending marriage education programs, only 10 to 15 per cent of couples undertake any form of marriage preparation. It is easier to get married in Australia than it is to obtain a dog licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of asking `Is getting divorced too easy?', perhaps we should be asking `Is getting married too easy?' A number of suggestions could be made to tackle this problem. Firstly, the government could adequately fund marriage and relationship education programs&mdash;something it does not do at present. Secondly, civil celebrants, who today officiate at the weddings of almost half of all couples, should be required to encourage couples to undertake some preparation for marriage. It is unacceptable for civil celebrants, some of whom earn up to $90,000 a year, to reject all obligation to the readiness of couples for marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the notification period for marriage could be extended from the present period to a minimum of, say, 12 months. Obviously, some provision to waive this requirement would be necessary in appropriate circumstances, but usually couples have to book reception rooms, celebrants&mdash;whether civil or religious&mdash;and churches more than 12 months, in some cases 18 months to two years, before the wedding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is an also argument for making marriage education compulsory, as it is in some parts of the world. John Stuart Mill's famous essay <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">On Liberty</EMPHASIS> is frequently quoted in arguments against compulsion. However, Mill, the great defender of individual liberty, condoned the interference with others in upholding the best interests for children in compulsory schooling&mdash;a form of compulsory education. Why should we not also require marriage education, given the enormous consequences for the individuals concerned, for their children and for society generally when marriages fail and that breakdown occurs? Regrettably, this budget does nothing to improve one of the most difficult areas in family life today. </PARA>

About one-third to one-half of the people on this side who wanted to speak were able to contribute to the debate, which means that between one-half and two-thirds were kept out of the debate. Of those who participated, most voluntarily cut their time from 20 minutes to around 10 minutes in order to allow that small number to speak.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is just as bad in the consideration in detail stage. Half an hour is allowed for statements on the Attorney-General's Department, which gives six speakers the opportunity to speak for five minutes. That sort of timetable makes a mockery of the accountability of government. This means, yet again, that the Senate&mdash;not this House, the House of the people&mdash;will be left to examine government actions and proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the information that has been provided, we find that it has shrunk out of sight. In 1992-93, program performance statements of some 369 pages were provided. For the 1993-94 budget, program performance statements of some 368 pages, containing detailed information relating to budget initiatives, were provided. All that has been provided on this occasion is the portfolio budget measure statements comprising some 59 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference in the volume of information provided is stark. No explanation has been offered. One might venture the suggestion that the reason for this is that, in the short period between the presentation of the last budget and the presentation of this current budget, in order to fit it in prior to the commencement of the new financial year, there was not sufficient time to prepare documents in the full form as in previous years. On that basis, we might expect full statements before this debate had begun, but they have not been provided. I call upon the government to provide full statements. There is no reason evident why the government could not provide full statements on next year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have time to mention just a couple of measures in the budget papers. The first measure, which I support, is the decision to construct the Commonwealth law courts building in Melbourne. In last year's budget, $6.5 million was made for the repair of an unsatisfactory building in Little Bourke Street to provide for the Federal Court and other federal courts. That was a mistake, as I told the House last year. Fortunately, the government has realised the error and this year has accepted the need for a purpose-built building. In principle, I support it. Approximately $109 million has been provided over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference has been made with some pride by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to their access to justice proposals. However, what is proposed in the budget provides a poor attempt to meet the well-recognised need to provide better access to justice. Legal aid funding has increased by $2.1 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite ridiculous that members have been given five minutes to address portfolios and sums of money of these dimensions. Therefore, tonight, I want to confine my comments to the aviation section of the transport portfolio and raise a couple of issues. In doing so, I would like some answers from the government as to exactly what it intends to do in terms of a couple of its major policy announcements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue I will raise is that of the airport privatisation program, which in principle is supported by the opposition. We have all been aware that certain rating companies have put the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on notice that the Federal Airports Corporation may face some difficulties in terms of its credit ratings if some of the government's statements come to fruition. In particular, the minister was chipped by one of the major rating companies regarding his statement that Melbourne airport could be sold off separately from the rest of the Federal Airports Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that already there may be some difficulties within the Federal Airports Corporation. A major international air terminal is under construction in my home state of Brisbane. That has been quite controversial in terms of the decision by the government not to go ahead with the full development of that terminal. It has come to our notice that the work on the eighth gate&mdash;which was put in after there was a realisation that the growth of international aviation in and out of Brisbane was going to be greater than first estimated&mdash;has now been stopped. If that is true, I wonder whether that is as a result of some of the problems that the Federal Airports Corporation could well have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) is in here. I hope that he takes up the issue of the continued development of Badgerys Creek, which is a most vital airport development that the Australian infrastructure needs very much as a matter of urgency. We need definitive statements from the government as to whether it will guarantee the Federal Airports Corporation funding once the privatisation process comes about and whether the privatisation is to follow the line of the individual sale of airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second issue I would like to raise is what is happening with the free aviation agreement between Australia and New Zealand. In the One Nation statement some years ago, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that we would be moving towards an open aviation market between Australia and New Zealand. In fact, an agreement was reached between the then minister, Senator Collins, and New Zealand Minister Storey that this would proceed. We have seen some steps along the road to freeing up that market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the reality is that it is all supposed to be in place by the end of November this year. In fact, in answer to a question on notice I asked recently, the minister advised me that the internal arrangements of the situation would be completed by November this year. But that is not an indication that we will have a totally free market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is happening in the development of tourism and air rights into Australia is really quite interesting. One of the first moves that were made by the government, and quite rightly, was the agreement to give Air New Zealand beyond rights into Asia over Australia and for Qantas to pick up its beyond rights over New Zealand to places like Tahiti and Los Angeles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some figures issued recently by the Queensland government were quite substantial. The net increase to the Queensland tourism product through four New Zealand services a week last year was 25,000 passengers, worth something like $25 million and translated into 1,500 jobs. Quite frankly, if we are going to continue with the growth of tourism into Australia, the last thing we need in this country is to divert to some sort of two-airline policy in an international sense and go back to the old system of protectionism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A free market between Australia and New Zealand has enormous potential in terms of developing Australian tourism. The reality, especially out of those Asian markets, is that people want more than a one-country destination. The Australian Tourist Commission is coming around to that line of thinking at the moment. The promotion of the destination of the south-west Pacific has some tremendous ramifications for the growth of inbound tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we stop this process, we could well find ourselves quite embarrassed that visitors will turn themselves away from Australia. That would really be quite stupid. There are also problems with the arrangements with the Koreans about access over the Tasman sea. If we can get that arrangement in place as soon as possible, we have the possibility of having one of the most efficient and competitive international airline systems in the world. The word `tourism' is all about inbound tourism. It is not about outbound Australians any more. We have to maximise that effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to address my remarks mainly to the transport portfolio. Before doing so, I indicate that this is the first chance I have had to speak on the appropriation bills. I regret that we are dealing with this portfolio. Whilst in overall terms I think that what was announced in the budget is mostly good, this is a portfolio area where I have a number of concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first concern is one of omission. The omission that is repeated from last year's budget is the government's inability to resurrect the black spot program. I say that for two reasons: firstly, the black spot program was a very successful road safety measure; and, secondly, as was proven by bringing forward the expenditure in the One Nation statement, it had employment consequences. I hope that on both those grounds&mdash;as an infrastructure provision program and an employment provision program&mdash;we might see a return to the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Tim Colebatch, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> in August last year, said that the best illustration of the 1993-94 budget's lack of imagination was the black spot program getting the chop. Ministers praised it to the public as a life saving program which had high benefit cost ratios and which created jobs. Because the allocation was brought forward, there was no money for it in that budget and there is no money for it in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the transport portfolio that I want to discuss relates to the sale of public assets. Two of the principal measures of the budget in the run-up to the ALP's national conference in September are the sale of airports and the future of ANL. It would come as no surprise to a lot of members of this House that my starting position in all these debates is that we should retain in public ownership government business enterprises such as the ones I have mentioned. I have consistently had that as a starting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to enter into the proper and appropriate debate that is available to me within the party forums. I hope that a genuine debate will go on and forward into the national conference in September. A lot of the questions that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) raised are questions that will need answers if we are to see a proper consideration in the particular case of the disposal of the airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I listened with interest during the second reading debate to people such as the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), who talked about the Badgerys Creek airport. I know that this issue is dear to the heart of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who will be speaking during the consideration in detail stage. I understand the great importance, for the proper management of aviation in Sydney, of those government announcements about the future of Badgerys Creek going forward. I am confident that they can go forward under the present system of public ownership. I believe that we need to really give it a chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If we look at the transport portfolio overall, we see many opportunities for the government to do things that have great economic benefit. We should not lose our chance, through public ownership, to have control over those projects. If we look at our land transport policies and our road provision policies, we see that clearly in those aspects we have an advantage through public sector intervention in provision. If the public sector is not to provide in those areas, it should look at mechanisms through which it can go into partnership with the private sector to ensure that there is appropriate provision that has not only the physical infrastructure outcomes but, nearly as importantly, the social outcomes that are required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My great fear is that, as we divest government ownership of a number of these enterprises, we divest the power to have those influences that are additional to the actual enterprise itself and are important in the way that government business enterprises interface with people and in the provision of services over and above the strict commercial and economic ones. I hope that as a party we are able to have a mature debate and that we do not get hung up on ideological bents but are able to look at it in the context of what is in the long-term best interests of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk, in the five minutes available to me, about a range of issues surrounding the transport portfolio. The first is waterfront reform, in which this government has trumpeted its success over the last few years. I take this opportunity to put the performance of the Australian waterfront in the context of those nations that we have to compete with in the real world of commercial trade in the overseas markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that one of the major shipping companies does an analysis of the relative performances of the 44 ports that it visits in the course of its business activities in any particular year. Out of the 44 ports that it analysed, Sydney&mdash;which this government claims is one of the outstanding results of its waterfront reform policies&mdash;came in 43rd. In other words, 42 out of 44 ports around the world were able to perform better than the port of Sydney. The port of Auckland ranks around 16th. That port was reformed under a Labour government in New Zealand that went about the business of waterfront reform properly, not in the half-hearted manner in which this government went about it in the period from 1989 to 1990. Melbourne comes in 38th. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, out of 44 ports analysed, the two main ports in Australia came in 42nd and 38th. That is hardly anything for any government or any country to be proud of. Despite the fact that this government has spent $430 million of our money over that three-year period paying off waterside workers in order to get these improvements, whilst at the same time giving those who remain a 23 per cent increase in their pay, out of all of that money and all of that effort we have some of the worst performing ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this company's analysis, in the first quarter of 1994 Sydney moved 19.93 containers per hour. Melbourne slipped backwards, from a high point that this company assessed in the first part of 1993 of 25.6 containers per hour to 14.05 containers per hour in the first quarter of 1994. In other words, the Sydney and Melbourne ports had a deteriorating performance over the last 12 months. It is worth making the point that, when these figures for comparison were started in 1989, both those ports began from the lowest productivity points imaginable. In the period running up to waterfront reform, in order to get relatively good improvements in productivity, the unions ensured that from the time productivity was being measured in 1989 they ran productivity down to very low levels so that when they got back to normal levels they could boast a significant increase in productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to shipping. It was pleasing to see in the budget that the government had taken note of the complaints of people such as me and members on this side of the House&mdash;and, to be fair, people such as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis)&mdash;about the ridiculous increase, in effect a doubling, in the shipping industry, which was taking away all of the benefits of shipping reform that had been achieved by the industry over the previous 12 months. That is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to see, however, that the government is playing ducks and drakes on the issue of ANL, which the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) raised. It is quite clear that the government has decided that it will sell ANL to any bidder, foreign or domestic, but it is going through this charade of putting the whole process through the Labor Party annual conference in September of this year, trying to trick the unions into believing that it is concerned with their views. It is not. It is going to sell it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only trouble is that, in the process, it is creating mayhem with ANL's creditors&mdash;and with its customers, who are leaving in droves. Those who are concerned about the future of ANL, such as I and, obviously, the honourable member for Scullin, note that this business of playing ducks and drakes with it is causing that company to experience serious commercial problems which will leave it with virtually no value by the time the ALP conference comes around in September this year, where we are told a decision will be made. We already know the decision has been made. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) in raising the issue of airport privatisation, which I endorse for a range of reasons. The first is to work out what is the core business of government. There was a fashion after World War II for parties on the left to think that policy needed to be geared to grabbing control of the commanding heights of the economy. This was the genesis of big public enterprise policy and big nationalisation policy in many of the social democratic parties of the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It turned out that, far from grabbing the commanding heights of the economy in the public interest, all that happened was the establishment of a number of centralised public bureaucracies that had very little to do with the public interest. Anyone who has followed the debate about airports in Sydney, both at Mascot and at Badgerys Creek, would understand that policy has been geared to the needs of a rather self-serving centralised bureaucracy instead of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years we have had a lack of competition policy. At least out of privatisation there will be more active competition between those two airport sites in Sydney, Kingsford Smith and Sydney west international airport. Competition is important. So too is the revenue government can raise from this measure. There is absolutely no evidence that private sector organisations cannot build and operate airports effectively. The argument should be that airports are not part of the core responsibility of governments as long as the private sector can demonstrate that it can build airports and contribute the investment that would otherwise be a drain on the government and taxpayers' funds and that it can run those airports with regard to the public interest. If the government establishes a regulatory authority then we can be assured that the public interest will be defended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of issues have been raised in the debate, both inside and outside the parliament. The first of those concerns pricing policy. The Prices Surveillance Authority in its report some months ago was highly critical of the FAC for its pricing policies and investment criteria. Large capital outlays on aeronautical projects, such as terminal expansions, are driven more by engineering and service standards than by full economic evaluation. That is a problem, as too has been the FAC's absurd suggestion, based on a credit rating from Standard and Poors, that full privatisation to a single buyer is preferable to breaking up its assets into competing airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a suggestion that competing airports that are privatised will not be able to survive financially. The honourable member for Fadden raised the issue of their credit ratings. Anyone reading that PSA report would understand that the FAC has applied a uniform pricing structure across the nation for each of its airports, irrespective of local demand and cost factors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under a policy of competition and privatisation, provincial airports that are making a loss will need to change their pricing structure to reflect full costs so they can at the very least break even. Around the place there has been an argument, couched in equity terms, that increasing prices at airports via charges and fees will be a problem in terms of affordability for provincial areas. The truth is that airport fees and charges account for just three per cent of the price of airline tickets, so we are not talking about a large movement in price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more importantly, we are not talking about a social justice issue in terms of the beneficiaries of the current policy of cross-subsidisation. The untenable situation at the moment is that the cross-subsidies are hidden. They are not exposed in these budget papers or the annual report of the FAC. No government can base quality decisions on anything but quality information. But on these cross-subsidies we do not have the material. It is hidden away in the cross-subsidisation documents held by the FAC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonsense tells us that the beneficiaries of the cross-subsidies at provincial airports are, by and large, not low or even middle income earners. It is the higher income earners in this country who use Australian airports. For that reason, we are not talking about a big social justice issue. If prices go up in provincial airports and the subsidies are diminished, then the people who are paying the extra price are not low to middle income earners; they are, by and large, higher income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not something that will disadvantage, in social justice terms, needy and disadvantaged communities in Australia. Privatisation will involve a very small movement in price and the elimination of hidden cross-subsidies, the current beneficiaries of which are those in our community who least need them. So, in equity terms, this policy is totally justified. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to use the few minutes available to me in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) to talk about only one subject. I refer to the disgraceful cuts in road funding which are incorporated in this budget. At the same time as the government has raised revenue from fuel excise to record levels&mdash;it is getting close to $10 billion&mdash;it has slashed a further $200 million off road funding. It is now a mere $820 million. That means road funding has been slashed by 50 per cent in two years and the amount spent on roads this year will be lower than the $1,200 million spent when Labor first came to office. That is an appalling indictment of this government's attitude to roads. At a time when fuel excise receipts will be close to $10 billion, only 8.4 per cent of that revenue coming from motorists will go to roads.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard government members seeking to defend that situation by saying that the government is spending a lot of money on the effects of road trauma. Are they trying to say to us that they would prefer to spend taxpayers' money on picking up the damage after road accidents rather than seeking to do something about road trauma in the first place, namely, improving Australia's roads and therefore reducing the number of fatalities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own figures suggest that each road fatality costs Australia about $630,000. That means that we are spending over $6 billion each year on road trauma. That is really quite an appalling state of affairs, yet the government would prefer to spend money on this rather than on repairing our road network. The former minister for land transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), noted that the black spot program was one of the most outstanding programs for road safety that has ever been adopted by any government in Australia. That is the flamboyant language that is somewhat typical of this government. But this government has now moved to abolish the black spot program altogether. It has so little interest in the effects of poor roads on Australian motorists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Motorists travelling along the Bruce Highway near Federal, a small rural community in my electorate, receive a very poignant reminder of the effect on the motorists of Australia of poor roads. About 16 white crosses have been installed by the local community under the leadership of the Federal Hall Committee. Each one of these crosses represents the life of a motorist which has been lost in that particular area over recent years. In fact, one of the activists in this particular program, Mr Alf Malezer, says that about 29 people have died on this short</PARA>
<PARA>stretch of road between Six Mile Creek at Cooroy and Coles Creek Road at Skyring Creek in the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it costs $630,000 for each of those people, it would have cost Australian taxpayers $18 million on this particular piece of road alone. Why on earth cannot the government spend some of that $18 million to fix the road? Here is a clear case: 29 fatalities over a short distance of road. It is an ideal area for the black spot program to be targeted. But the black spot program has been abolished. A paltry road program was announced a few days ago. The government will spend $120 million on new projects. This seems to offer no hope that anything will be done on this horror stretch of road. All that will happen on the Bruce Highway will be a couple of extra passing lanes. There will be no fundamental assault on what is clearly a dangerous piece of road. The reason nothing will be done is that this government continues to slash road funding to the lowest real levels in Australian history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has an enormous impact not only with respect to the convenience of motorists, the cost of transport in this country and the level of pollution in our cities, but also on the number of fatalities and injuries that will occur not just on this section of road but on the whole national road system. Much of the blame for that can be attributed directly to this government's persistent and consistent cutbacks in road funding. It needs to rethink its attitude to roads. It needs to return to Australian motorists some of the tax revenue that is taken from them. It should help do something to restore a proper and decent national road system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to continue my remarks on airport privatisation. The privatisation program initiated by the government in this budget can be supported on equity grounds and on the basis of the core business of government. There is absolutely no evidence that private sector organisations cannot effectively construct and operate airports. It is also apparent that private sector ownership can play a very dynamic role in regional economic development strategies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent McKinsey study on business investment and regional prosperity reported on the important role of Cairns as the only major airport in Australia not owned by the FAC. Through the port authority, a dynamic marketing strategy was put in place at Cairns in order to attract people to the airport. Dynamic links with the business community were also established. That is very important. It is in the vested interests of a private sector operator of an airport to make sure that the land surrounding the airport site is well used by manufacturing and tourism enterprises and is well supported and developed. That means that more users will come through the airport for freight and tourism purposes. It is important to get the vested interests right. While the FAC has not done that sort of planning in the past, we can look forward to privately owned airports undertaking that role and playing a very dynamic role in regional economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite the case of western Sydney and the slow development of Badgerys Creek under FAC policy. This has now been reversed by the actions in this budget. The privatisation program will fund the initial stage of Badgerys Creek in order to develop the international length runway and in the year 2000 it will be handed over to private sector operation, ownership and management. That is the strategic way in which to place airport investment. The funds out of privatisation will be used in the initial stage, which is the stage that the private sector will not fund itself, to develop important parts of the national transport infrastructure, as was acknowledged by the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). </PARA>

The FAC runs Kingsford Smith airport as it is its most profitable airport, sustaining 55 per cent of its nationwide profits of $89 million in 1992-93. The development of Badgerys Creek and the attraction of modern airport technology and curfew-free operations would bring substantial competition to the aviation market in Sydney and it would cut into the profits of Kingsford Smith. Competition and privatisation linked together are essential to break up this public sector monopoly and produce much more dynamic regional economic development strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC's monopoly has also been used to shelter the airline industry from competition. Restrictive trade practices at airport terminals contributed significantly to the demise of Compass. In Sydney, the Chief Executive of Ansett, Graeme McMahon, has admitted, `It is about time that Ansett Airlines confessed that the lack of a second international airport is the problem. But that confession is far too late now. This whole issue during the third runway debate was all an attempt by the domestic aviation carriers to prevent a second airport and to prevent competition in the domestic aviation market.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to acknowledge that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has proved that it is not too late. The third runway might be proceeding and its construction about to finish, but at least the government has now made this decision to proceed with the second international airport at Badgerys Creek. The very candid remark from Graeme McMahon proves the point. There has in this nation been an aviation cartel in place&mdash;a cartel that has relied on monopoly control of airports by the FAC and restrictive trade practices such as those that restricted Compass. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the House took a minute of its time to remember the D-day landings on 6 June 1944. I would like to take a few moments to add to that by giving some details. I would have thought we would have had an opportunity to debate those today. It has been said in many places that today, Monday, 6 June, is the 50th anniversary of D-day&mdash;the day the liberation of Europe began. The invasion began at dawn on this day. The allied invasion was known as Operation Overlord and it involved 155,000 troops, 12,000 aircraft, 6,500 naval transport craft in 75 convoys and over 1,200 tanks. It was the greatest armada ever formed. It was an event without military precedent and one I doubt and hope we will ever see exceeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a colossal feat of organisation and was the product of years of exhaustive planning and basic hard work which commenced in 1943. Operation Overlord was under the supreme command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Included in this force were approximately 2,500 Australian defence personnel, mainly in the air force. There were 2,000 personnel in the air force, 400 in the navy and 100 in the army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">D-day allied casualties&mdash;those killed and wounded&mdash;are estimated at some 6,000 people. By the time Hitler's Atlantic wall had been breached, total allied casualties amounted to 12,500, including 2,500 killed. This did not compare with the first day of the terrible Battle of the Somme in World War I. In the first three months following D-day, 200,000 Germans are estimated to have been killed and wounded. In addition, over the same period some 200,000 German prisoners of war were taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The invasion consisted of troops from the United States, Britain and Canada landing at five points on the Normandy coastline. The five landings were codenamed Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. The allied forces were confronted by some 50,000 German troops, 319 operational aircraft, 21 ships and 127 tanks. The reason for the success of this operation was due to a massive deception operation codenamed Fortitude carried out by the allied command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finding it impossible to hide the massive build-up of troops and equipment in the south of England, the deception assumed even greater importance in the overall plan. Mythical armies and phantom groups with dummy camps and equipment were created. Their main objective was to make the Germans believe that the Normandy landing was a feint and merely an overture to main landings elsewhere on the French coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other deception plans codenamed Tractable, Glimmer and Quicksilver were all of importance in this overall plan. By the end of D-day, 6 June 1944, the allies had achieved their main aim, although not capturing all their objectives laid down in the original plan. This day we commemorate the courage, commitment and gallantry of these people. Their bravery and determination to free the world from Nazi German occupation was a major contributor to the democracy that we now enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to say anything about the courage of those people and how important it was that Australia continued to be involved, notwithstanding its own responsibilities to the people of Australia in the Pacific, from where many of our troops had been withdrawn. Australians were involved in Europe because democracy as we know it was under threat from a totalitarian and very vicious regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">D-day is a very important day. This will not be the last day on which we celebrate the efforts to bring peace. It has taken a long time to achieve peace. Unfortunately, as we speak, there are parts of the world where war and death are still major problems. Nevertheless, this parliament and this country will be looking forward to the victory days next year, in May and August, when we will be remembering the end of the war in Europe and the Pacific. I sincerely trust that on those days this parliament will be prepared to allocate sufficient time to properly discuss those matters and put on record the great thanks to the soldiers of all those wars who protected our democratic system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last full week of May the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts visited Western Australia as part of its inquiry into employment and the environment. We were there to examine the site reclamation projects and the forest industry. We were shown over the Alcoa bauxite mine in the jarrah forest country, the karri forest projects in the south-west corner of Western Australia, a quarry where the land is being reclaimed and various other projects. We were impressed by the work that Alcoa is doing in the reclamation of land where bauxite has been mined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While being briefed by Alcoa, I asked the senior staff person from the Department of Conservation and Land Management from Western Australia, commonly known as CALM, how many people were employed by the department in that region. She said, `It depends which week you ask. If you had asked two weeks ago the answer would have been 13 and if you ask this week the answer is eight.' Absolutely astonished by this reduction in staffing, we explored this matter further. We were told that the Western Australian government is reducing the staff of the Department of Conservation and Land Management from 1,200 at present to 1,000 people. This reduces the number of staff available from 13 to eight for tree planting, forest management, park ranging and guiding tourists around the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we explored this matter still further we found that this was the second wave of staff reductions. About three years ago there were 1,400 staff. The government is now in the process of reducing that number to 1,000. This is at a time when the majority of Australians say they are more concerned about the environment than economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not a part of Australia which is not aware of the importance of careful management of our forests. We all know that about half of our forests have been cut down. It is crucial for the survival of ecosystems in Australia that our forests be protected and that those that are going to be cut down, or in this case removed because of bauxite mining, be replanted as quickly as possible. In other words, effective management is absolutely essential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian state government is in the process of nearly halving the number of people employed on this vital project. This is extraordinarily inconsistent with any serious conservation or employment goals of government. The Commonwealth government announced in its white paper a series of employment programs to give work experience and training to the long-term unemployed. Some of the most attractive and appropriate projects in this regard announced by the Commonwealth government involve landcare, forest management and tree planting, yet permanent jobs in that area are being decimated by the Western Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a terrible reflection on its priorities. It is being completely irresponsible about caring for the environment. It seems very important to put pressure on the Western Australian government to change its priorities so that the very limited forests in Western Australia will be much more carefully managed. It is true that the Commonwealth's funding of the states has been reduced and that makes it more difficult for the states; nevertheless, it is still a reflection of the state government's own priorities that this is being allowed to happen. I make this public protest about that and draw attention to it to put pressure on the Western Australian government to change its policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest as honourable members on the coalition side saluted what the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) called our most beautiful flag. It almost brought a tear to the eye. There is no doubt about the ability of members of this House to engage in the customary round of jingoism to score points and to prove their Australianness.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funnily enough, when it comes to the question of our attitude to the Indonesian government's denial of human rights&mdash;so-called&mdash;in East Timor, the jingoists quickly become what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) calls lickspittles. The problem is that it is a disease which afflicts both sides of the House. The fact that John Pilger pontificates from afar rather than participating in the political struggles that he asks others to take up annoys me too. However, in the end, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) cannot hide behind that defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ask a question about a visa for Gerry Adams, and the Prime Minister compares him with the racist holocaust apologist David Irving. Ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs the same question and he will tell you that Adams must renounce violence. It is interesting. Only a couple of weeks after I popped the question to the Prime Minister, I read that an Indonesian general was visiting Australia. I am sure the Left in the Australian Labor Party would have been interested in that too. I suppose he was a pacifist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pilger might, to quote the foreign minister, play to the crowds but who, we might ask, is the Australian government playing to? If it is true the government cannot do anything, so be it. If it cannot do anything, then it should give up on all the rhetoric about an independent Australia engaging in meaningful dialogue in Asia. Pilger is right to criticise the Prime Minister's fake republicanism. As Pilger points out, the Prime Minister talks tough in the parliament but his deference to the Indonesians is little different from the deference to the monarchy that he condemns in the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs says that Australia and Indonesia often differ on human rights issues.

But in Indonesia we equivocate on every score. If we are to be a truly independent republic, then the street fighters of the New South Wales Right will need to lift their game. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the new Parliament and in Territory society, the racial divide may deepen if political leaders allow it to. Moreover, Mr Perron may feel emboldened to agitate against the Mabo social justice package. This, too, would be very regrettable and an unacceptable interference by Mr Perron in what should be seen as a national responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. The Northern Territory has the largest percentage of Aboriginal citizens of any Australian electorate. It is a tragedy that in Australia today there exists a government which is prepared to make these citizens some of the poorest in Australia&mdash;a pawn in its tawdry determination to remain in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-time observers of territory politics are in no doubt that the CLP government plays the politics of racial division in every election campaign. Two of my own colleagues, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) and Senator Bob Collins&mdash;who are better informed on territory politics than anyone in the country&mdash;live with the CLP's divisive tactics every day of their lives. Senator Collins blew the whistle on the CLP's latest despicable campaign with the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way in which the CLP played white off against black has underpinned this election in a more direct and upfront way than it ever has in the past.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could deny it, with the CLP campaigning on claims that election of a Labor government would mean two sets of laws in the territory: one for white territorians and another for Aboriginal territorians? Who could deny it when a land claim, allegedly over the whole of Darwin, was announced by an Aboriginal territorian in the presence of the CLP minister responsible for Aboriginal affairs two days before the election? No-one who is informed believes for a moment that the CLP did not have a hand in this cynical piece of exploitation. Who could deny it when hundreds of residents in two key Labor held seats received calls from a Perth company, allegedly carrying out a poll which comprised a series of loaded questions designed to imply that a vote for the sitting Labor member would have consequences which bore no resemblance to territory Labor's policies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has over many years poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the CLP government's coffers, with the specific intention of improving the health status of Aboriginal territorians. After 20 years in office, the CLP government has consistently failed to deliver better health outcomes for Aboriginal citizens, many of whom have health profiles which would disgrace a Third World country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a government which is currently spending $170 million on new parliamentary facilities and $43,000 on cutlery for parliamentarians, when it cannot deliver effective health services to 25 per cent of the territory's population. We have a government which is prepared in its latest budget to spend more on one new gun club in the Northern Territory than it is prepared to spend on Aboriginal health clinics in the whole of the territory. Perhaps it is time for the Commonwealth to seriously examine the possibility of directly funding Aboriginal organisations to ensure that adequate health services are delivered to the people they serve. It is now patently obvious that the territory's CLP government is not prepared to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Territory is geographically Australia's closest contact point with Asia, and the territory government has made much of this physical closeness as it seeks to open up trade and cultural links with this important part of the world. But the territory's poor treatment of its indigenous people and the none too subtle politics of division which it practices are doing nothing to help Australia's national drive to forge strong trade and cultural links with South-East Asia. Asian nations which are determined to improve the living standards of their own populations will not be impressed by a territory government which is not prepared to give priority to the most disadvantaged group within its own community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, what faith can Aboriginal territorians have in a government which is prepared during an election campaign to exploit a top Aboriginal sportsman in an attempt to attack territory Aboriginal land councils? Australian rules footballer Jason Jones had his personal support for an individual CLP candidate used in a CLP election advertisement in close proximity to a comment critical of land councils.

That the D-day invasion on 6 June 1944 turned the tide is undisputed and well documented in the hundreds of print and film documentaries we have all seen in the last week or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to an Australian unsung hero who survived not only D-day but also the end of the war, and who is commemorating the 50th anniversary today. I refer to a personal friend, Keith Stevens, who was born in Hampton Park in Victoria. He volunteered for the RAAF in 1939, was sent to Canada for aircrew training in 1940, and subsequently to Britain to join 57 Squadron, 5 Group, of the RAF Bomber Command. Prior to D-day, he had been involved in the lead-up to the dambuster raids in Germany and had regularly carried out bombing raids on targets in Germany. He attained the rank of pilot officer and, later, flight lieutenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Keith's role began on D-day minus one when his squadron was sent to bomb German coastal batteries to ensure a safe landing for allied troops. He says that, on the way home, he saw below him part of the enormous armada on its way to the Normandy beaches. Soon afterwards, on 8 July, Keith had to bail out over northern France when his plane was shot down while on a raid to destroy caves at St Leu D'Esseront where thousands of V1 and V2 rockets were housed. The raid had been ordered by General Eisenhower and its success probably saved London from attacks by a further 4,000 rockets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nursing a broken shoulder and injured back, and after having been captured by and escaping from the Gestapo, Keith was finally found by a French farmer who introduced him to the local resistance group. He lived precariously, disguised as a local, for three months despite speaking only a few words of French and German. This ended when the Americans broke through the Falaise Gap and liberated Clairemont, where he was staying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He returned to Britain in September 1994 and then came home to Australia. He was decorated three times, receiving the Distinguished Flying Medal from Britain, the Cross of Valour from Poland and the Bronze Medal of Merit from France. Keith is the Australian convenor of the Escape Society, which was formed after the war by Lord Portal and Sir Basil Embry to include only servicemen who had escaped from the Germans in World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story ended happily for Keith. He married a Scottish girl, Anita, whom he met while in Britain. They live in Rosebud in my state of Victoria. Despite back and shoulder injuries which still cause him trouble, Keith was one of the lucky ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded of an anecdote from the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Not as a Duty Only</EMPHASIS> by Jo Gullett, another Australian&mdash;a remarkable man&mdash;who was fighting on D-day. Incidentally, he later became a member of this House for the seat of Henty in Victoria. Jo Gullett recalled that, after being wounded, he was sent to England to recuperate. He met `a young Australian pilot' who had `a tremendous air of happiness and wellbeing. He was well built and very good looking.' Jo went with the young man, John Rutter, to meet an English girl.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of major importance because it represents completely new technology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing about this contract is that the majority of the work involved will be sourced in the Hunter region. It holds out a great deal of hope for the young people of our area. Over recent decades&mdash;as is the case in your electorate, Mr Speaker&mdash;because of advances that have been made in technology, the iron and steel industry that has been the traditional employer of people has seen an enormous reduction in its work force. Today, BHP in Newcastle employs only about 3,000 people whereas at its height 15 years ago, to produce about the same amount of iron and steel, it was employing 13,000 to 14,000 people. The similarity with the Illawarra region holds because the coal industry, which was once labour intensive and provided jobs for many of our young people, is today also highly mechanised, and the jobs for our young people are simply not available. The provision of jobs is the hope that this particular contract brings to our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The infrastructure that will be put in place for ADI to construct these ships does not end at the end of the contract. The cost of establishing the shipyard itself is in the order of $20 million. When this contract is finally completed in the year 2002, after the sixth ship has been turned out, that infrastructure will be in place. The Hunter region will be in a very desirable situation whereby it can be a world leader in this type of technology. That is sincerely our hope, and that is what ADI is offering. ADI does not see this contract as being merely to provide six minehunters; it sees it as an opportunity to develop an industry that Australia has never had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to be able to advise the House this evening that we in the Hunter region are extremely proud to have won the contract. We do not look upon these ships as warships and, therefore, we do not see this as being an aggressive move. Instead, we look upon these ships as being able to be used to defend Australia's integrity. They will be there in case something like a Gulf War occurs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The practice of allowing university employees to use resources available to them at taxpayers' expense and thereby undercut private consulting firms must be stopped. In bringing this matter to the attention of the House, I refer to the experience of one of my constituents, Mr Alan Lloyd, a consultant micropaleontologist who has a vast knowledge and background in the field and who has written many detailed scientific papers and publications. Mr Lloyd is a very distinguished member of my constituency, having been a great participant in many environmental debates and as somebody who has taken a great deal of interest in preserving some of the urban bush environments that still remain in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lloyd has been involved in the petroleum industry, principally to Australia's north and extensively in South-East Asia, through his consulting business since 1955. In every sense, he is an expert in his field. That field is principally involved with the categorisation of fossil remains sampled at prospective oil exploration areas to determine age and likelihood of discovery of an oil body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Mr Lloyd has been so badly undercut in the past by competing consultants who are employed by Australian universities that he is in danger of being put out of business. Mr Lloyd, like most businessmen, has outlaid money on infrastructure, such as expensive computer equipment and electronic plotting equipment, and has even spent time and money to develop his own software to ensure he offers his clients the best possible service. The costs and expertise of these items are, of course, built into Mr Lloyd's costs, which are passed on to his employers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 19 October 1993:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article entitled `Australia free traders who can't sell a sausage' in the Australian Financial Review of 11 October 1993.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1480" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="PARKES">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr Bilney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The European market for processed foods is the largest in the world and Australia, with the reputation it enjoys for high quality, environmentally sound food production, has a very significant potential to exploit this market. Australian food exporters have had less success in this regard than might have been expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no doubt a number of reasons for this, prime amongst them being the European Union's (EU) Common Agriculture policy that serves to severely restrict non EU countries' access to the EU market for commodities. This is a major barrier preventing Australian companies from reaping the benefits of their considerable comparative advantage in this area. For example, for sheep meat, Australia is restricted to a quota of 17,500 tonnes per annum; similar restrictions apply to beef, 6,000 tonnes per annum and, for cheese, 3,000 tonnes per annum; over and above these quotas exorbitant levies apply. The Uruguay Round settlement of the GATT, while it is welcomed for the positive impact its provisions should have by introducing disciplines on domestic and export subsidies and in reigning in excess agricultural production, has offered only very modest prospects for increases in Australian exports of these commodities to EU markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another factor which operates to hinder free access for  Australian agricultural products to the EU market is the propensity for the European Commission and some EU Member States to impose unilateral provisions for veterinary checking of imported food products. While Australia respects the right of other countries to impose high health standards for imported food, we have expressed concern where such provisions are either introduced without adequate consultation or where they give the appearance of serving to protect local industries from outside competition or of being used to extract some reciprocal benefit from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty of increasing agricultural commodity exports to the EU highlights the need for the Australian food exporters to concentrate their efforts in the processed food area which is generally not subject to quantitative restrictions and where tariffs are low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that food exporters are often inhibited by the high freight rates to Europe for fresh, chilled or frozen products. In some cases intra-company export franchising arrangements may also be a constraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also true that the opportunity cost of exporting to the European Union is high, when Asian markets are both easier to service and achieving much higher growth rates than elsewhere. In 1992/3 six out of Australia's ten largest export markets for processed food and beverages were in Asia. Thailand and Malaysia rank 13 and 14 respectively. Annual growth 1988-92 of highly processed food exports to seven Asian markets grew by more than 10% per annum with Thailand, Malaysia, Taiwan and Indonesia being around 20%. This has led the Agri-food Council to target the Asean region for increased food exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, processed food exports to the European Union remains an area with significant potential for improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Government will continue to develop its multilateral and bilateral relationships to ensure that more opportunities are available to Australian exporters. This will include efforts in the GATT, the UN and the OECD, as well as our ongoing contact with individual nations within the EU. Australia will continue to press for further reforms of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its export facilitation body, Austrade, has an extensive program to assist companies export to Europe. This includes a network of offices in Europe, participation in food trade fairs, active seeking out of Australian capacity to compete in Europe by its domestic network in Australia, undertaking market research for companies and working with key clients to pursue specific opportunities. For example, Austrade has a contract from a major client to identify key food buying contacts from European supermarkets and similar organisations to invite to Australia to increase their awareness of Australian food and beverage capability and quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade is organising Australian participation at SIAL 94 in Paris (23-27 Oct 1994)&mdash;Europe's second largest food trade exhibition. It is also organising Australian participation at important events such as Gastro Nord in Sweden and Vinitaly in Milan 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the many trade offices in Europe, Austrade also has six specialist offices devoted to increasing investment, including in Australian food processing and beverage industry. While the main attraction is to employ Australia as a base to export manufactured product into Asia, it can also include Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's participation at ANUGA `93&mdash;the world's largest food fair&mdash;in September/October 1993 produced good results. As on previous occasions, Austrade organised Australian participation involving 20 exhibitors representing over 40 Australian food exporters. Preliminary reports indicate Australian firms made actual sales of $11.9m during the fair and project sales of $90.5m over the next 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's wine exports continue to go from strength to strength in Europe. Europe accounts for 54% of world wine consumption and takes over 60% of Australia's exports. Austrade and the Australian Wine and Brandy Council are actively involved in the promotion of Australian wines in Europe. Australia is about to sign a Wine Agreement with the EU which will foster further growth in this trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Government initiatives include the United Kingdom/Australia Trade and Investment Conference in January 1994, sponsored jointly by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade. Bringing together, as it did, over 500 business leaders from the two countries, this conference was judged an outstanding success and should help to improve two-way trade and investment flows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, while the Government is doing its bit to facilitate exports to Europe, it is also up to the relevant industries to find opportunities and develop them. </PARA>

Note that using this approach it is possible to have negative numbers of school leavers in a State because of migration effects, interstate transfer of students and the effect of some students repeating or skipping a year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 May, Dr Hewson asked the Treasurer a question without notice concerning the estimate of revenue to be raised from companies in 1994-95 as a result of the compliance enhancement measures announced in the Treasurer's statement on tax policy of September 1992. Dr Hewson also wanted to know on what basis this estimate was prepared. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the then Treasurer's September 1992 Statement on Tax Policy it was estimated that an extra $750 million of revenue would be collected in 1994-95 through these compliance enhancement measures; it was estimated that $335 million of this $750 million would be collected from companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate for company collections through these measures was based on ATO research and experience that indicated the extra revenue could be raised by allocating additional resources to the following activities:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Large/Medium Project</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was estimated that the Large/Medium project would account for $250 million of the $335 million in 1994-95. This estimate was arrived at having regard to the following factors:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their evaluation of the large case Audit program, Boston Consulting Group concluded that compliance would improve if taxpayers were made more aware of their tax obligations. It was conservatively estimated that the Large/Medium project would increase compliance by 2-3% by 1994-95, resulting in additional revenue of $200 million. This estimate was arrived at after consideration of the indirect effects obtained in other areas from compliance activity (eg improved compliance from the announcement of TFN), and judgments based on the dollar value of the strategic issues which would be covered by the tax  rulings and determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the extra resources used in direct audit activity were estimated, based on past results, to yield an additional $50 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expansion of Business Audit Activities</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of past results it was estimated that the additional resources allocated to the expansion of business audit activities would yield an additional $25 million of revenue in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Record Keeping and Expanded Information Reporting</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was estimated that the record keeping and expanded information reporting component of the strategy would account for $60 million of the $335 million in 1994-95. This estimate was based on estimates of improved compliance due to better record keeping by business, and reduced opportunity for misreporting of income in industries subject to the expanded reporting arrangements.</PARA>
