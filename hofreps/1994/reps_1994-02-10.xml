<TITLE>Leaded Petrol</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the reduction of octane quality of leaded petrol from January 1994, resulting from the government's `Lead Roundtable' meeting. The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Will result in worse vehicle operation, higher emissions and greater fuel consumption for up to three million vehicles;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)Will have negligible benefit to the community, through reduced lead emissions, because the oil industry proposes to leave lead levels in petrol unchanged in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, and because the use of leaded petrol already is rapidly decreasing;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)Will disadvantage vehicle enthusiasts and low income members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And your petitioners therefore pray that the House take action to ensure the continued availability of high octane petrol for Australian motorists.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, I thank my colleagues for enabling me to continue on this matter and speak a second time. There are two or three issues which I want to raise but, predominantly, I wish to deal with a possible structure, as I see it, with two tiers of government in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken at length on the inconsistencies and the problems that people have. For instance, a plumber who came to New South Wales from Victoria could not practise in his trade for at least one year because he could not obtain registration. There are many inconsistencies and problems. I have spoken about the huge mice plague in Victoria and South Australia, which was extremely costly, with one state enabling a poison to be used but another state not permitting the poison to be used; and I pointed out that mice do not know boundaries and that this created huge problems in both states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, the Business Council of Australia has drawn attention to a number of inconsistencies. I instance the maritime industry in New South Wales. It has been pointed out that there has been a huge increase to the New South Wales government in funds obtained from the maritime industry, so that microeconomic reform has been wiped out by state taxes. Costs have gone up from $15 million in 1989 to $64 million in 1993 because the state has ripped off benefits from the maritime industry where there was supposed to be coordinated action for microeconomic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, in regard to electricity, New South Wales has been reluctant to cooperate with an eastern grid between Tasmania and Queensland&mdash;reluctant to cooperate because it is ripping off about $300 on average from each household through an electricity tax on industry and households through New South Wales; that is, $300 each being ripped off to keep the state going. I said that at least $10 billion could be saved by rationalising government in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are talking about reform, at least the Business Council of Australia is showing less hypocrisy than a number of other industry organisations and less hypocrisy than a lot of people in government. The Business Council has pointed out how the Special Premiers Conference in 1990-91 tried to see movement towards international policy making in the reaction of states to decisions made in that conference. The council pointed out that the South Australian Liberal Party rejected the mutual recognition package negotiated in the forum. Western Australia has yet to pass legislation ratifying the Commonwealth act involved in those reforms, according to the January-February 1994 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the States had agreed on a national scheme whereby all legal challenges. . . be commenced in the Supreme Court of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA>Then we have the Western Australian Supreme Court warning of `substantial impairment of the rule of law as a foundation of democracy'&mdash;as if democracy is dependent on a government in each state and a court that is separate in each state. The Business Council says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where Australia's international competitiveness is at stake, the call for `national' solutions comes from industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from an address by Gary L. Sturgess, the former Director-General of the Cabinet Office of the New South Wales government, reported in that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Council Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, it is possible for us to get more democracy&mdash;in fact, it is likely that we will get more democracy&mdash;by the sort of rationalisation of government that I am talking about. We could have one court system, a national court system, including environmental, family support, and a wide range of important issues, with the local courts as we have now. We certainly need to have, and could have, local assemblies. In fact, the Australian assistance plan developed by the present Governor-General showed just how local assemblies, local groups of people, could be involved in important democratic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have precinct committees with local council committees that may be elected. But the basis ought to be county councils or, as someone called them, regional assemblies. Those assemblies or county councils could appoint people to meet with the local council committees. They could ensure that local resident assemblies were convened and that the county members, or electorate members in the case of the national parliament, could meet with them. These groups could have the right to initiate referenda with signed petitions of minimum numbers of residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These county councils or regional assemblies could administer not only local policies but many of the national policies on a local level. I am not advocating a particular structure but suggesting a possible structure to show that it could be democratic and it could be effective and efficient. I am suggesting a minimum of 65,000 electors in an area with natural boundaries based on a city&mdash;a fairly large city&mdash;because in that way it will work and we will have a natural regional centre. For instance, Melbourne and Sydney could be one county or region each. Maybe the whole of the state of Tasmania could be one county. Those counties could vary in full-time members from five to 50. The mayor and the deputy could be directly elected by the people or by the council, and the council would monitor all departments, which must respond to questions from council when they are operating in a local area. The council could decide local emphases and approve development and other appropriate activities, including present federal, state and local responsibilities if they are appropriate. The members could be rostered to local council committees and they could delegate appropriate responsibilities to those local council committees. But those local council committees are part of the county or regional structure and must link into it and, as I said, the full-time members would be rostered to meet with those local committees so it is all knitted together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those councils, depending on their population, could appoint from their members between one and 10 full-time senators, and we could have a national senate, as we do now, with fewer than 100 members from those councils, and that senate could coordinate local policies. It would disburse funds, as I see it; it could prepare budgets and submit them to the House of Representatives; or the councils could, as the Business Council of Australia suggested one or two years ago, raise their own funds on a national basis, but the amount would need to be agreed to by the House of Representatives, which ought to be able to check, for instance, for approved borrowing levels in international borrowing, and maybe check as well to ensure equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would continue with national electorates, although I believe there ought to be more flexibility so that the electorates could have between 65,000 and 75,000 people and boundaries could approximate as closely as possible local boundaries. There might be more federal members in some local council areas than others. We would have the House of Representatives continuing as now, formulating national policies and endorsing national budgets both from the executive and from the Senate. When budgets are not agreed to, there could be a joint parliamentary sitting of both the parliaments, the Senate and the House of Representatives, and that joint sitting may well be involved in the appointment of a head of state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These suggestions have no relationship whatsoever to whether we are republic or not; they could happen equally if we were a republic or if we are a monarchy. But it could be a responsibility of the joint parliament to appoint a head of state; to endorse budget expenditure, especially where there is dispute; and to allocate funds to councils if there is a dispute between the two parliaments. It could be chaired by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, with the casting vote available to the Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole suggestion, I believe, merits consideration. The Business Council of Australia a year or so ago stated that we ought to be able to get all this together, and Gary Sturgess, formerly of the New South Wales Premier's Department, is saying that it seems as if the Australian people want the states&mdash;although when I go round I find they do not&mdash;and therefore we have to try to get more cooperation. We can certainly compete better if we compete on the basis of natural geographic boundaries. That is what we ought to be doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is certainly something refreshingly honest about the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). He has no hidden agenda and he certainly says what he believes. Indeed, on many occasions in this place he has very clearly put forward a point of view which is highly unpopular. I oppose the motion on reforming the structure of government which has been moved by my colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. What the honourable member is suggesting in his motion is that the constitutional structures as we know them today, the constitutional structures which have guaranteed this nation the stability it has, should be torn up. In particular, the motion is a revamp of Whitlam's much discredited policy which sought to set up regions controlled by Canberra to replace the sovereign states which, of course, as we all know, derive their authority from the Australian constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach is not new to the Australian Labor Party, and many people on the government benches hold a similar attitude. I recall a particular interjection by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who seconded the motion supporting the abolition of the states. Ben Chifley, a Labor icon in this country, also supported the centralisation of power in Canberra. Many years ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I favour abolition of state parliaments and greatly extended powers given to locally governing authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, of course, would have controlled the purse strings. So much for `greatly extended powers given to local authorities'. Those people who advocate the abolition of the federal system as we know it today really mean that we should scrap the states, and all the constitutional protection and constitutional authority given to them, and transfer the powers that they have to Canberra. Some of those powers would then be allocated to regions but, of course, the overall controlling force would be the government in Canberra. Regions would merely be local agents for the implementation of centrally imposed policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Eden-Monaro is taking the centralist agenda of the Australian Labor Party to the extreme. He is introducing a radical plan to abolish all state and territory governments. He wants to scrap the more than 900 local government authorities in Australia and replace them with about 100 regional authorities. Of course, as I said a moment ago, ultimate power would reside in the federal government, and in the hands of a group of unrepresentative and out of touch Labor politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member does, however, deserve full credit for persistence and for consistency in relation to this matter. In 1990, the honourable member moved:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Australian federal system is costly and inefficient, impedes social justice and fairness and should be replaced by a two-tier system consisting of reformed and strengthened national and local government structures.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member then cited some major problems that he saw with our federal system. They included that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a plumber registered in Victoria cannot practise or operate in New South Wales . . . a person can be fined for turning right in front of someone turning left in New South Wales and fined for doing the opposite in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>I suspect he is not referring to politics. The member said that he moved the motion because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">people do not have power over their governments; they do not have sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA>I know the honourable member mentioned in his address just a moment ago that perhaps a better system would be to have a provision for citizen initiated referenda at all levels of government. This would certainly return sovereignty to the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could not dispute that the federal government is running amuck and out of control and that people do not have any power over it. Honourable members only have to look at the letters to the editor columns in the newspapers, listen to talkback radio programs, or look at the commentary in newspapers and in other media outlets to know that people are frustrated. People do not believe that they have any say at all in how we, as a nation, are governed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that both people who vote for the government and those who vote for us will all agree that the federal government is remote, it is unrepresentative and it is out of touch. State governments and local authorities are, however, closer to their people and more likely to represent their views than is their federal counterpart. It should not, of course, be forgotten that almost half of the members of the House of Representatives come from the Sydney and Melbourne areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there are problems in relation to interstate registrations of plumbers, and we obviously need more uniform road rules, but these sorts of matters can be addressed, and indeed are being addressed, by cooperation among levels of government. I think it is a fairly sad commentary on Australian society that the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used as one of his vehicles for running over the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, his opposition to Hawke's new federalism policy. That policy sought to have a very sensible approach among all levels of government so that the kinds of difficulties outlined by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro could be harmoniously addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already in most portfolio areas we have standing committees of various state and territory ministers. For instance, we have the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and much progress has been made in standardising laws and procedures within our federal system. More needs to be done. For instance, Australia really requires a national curriculum for schools but I understand that this matter is now being addressed. We can solve these problems within our system without tearing up the constitution which has served us so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no point in throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Australia is a vast country and our existing state, territory and local governments are more likely to represent the views and aspirations of their constituencies than a remote, centralised, monolithic structure based in Canberra and controlled by the people of Sydney and Melbourne through the very large number of representatives they have in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always interesting to hear government members talk about sovereignty and independence. We all know what a sham the Prime Minister's republican push is. He talks about our becoming an independent nation whereas every day of the week we find the executive in this country entering into more and more international treaties, many of which subvert Australia's international independence. We find that there can now be appeals from the courts of this country to United Nations committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, what they are doing in many cases is subverting our independence and eroding our sovereignty, and yet we find government members coming into this place and saying that Australia should be independent, that we should give more sovereignty to the people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current system of government may not be perfect&mdash;there is always room for improvement&mdash;but as yet no-one, to my knowledge, has suggested that there is a system which is any better. Over the last few years we have seen a trend globally, but particularly in central and eastern European, towards decentralisation of authority. People in those countries are rejecting systems of centralised government because they have utterly failed. Despite that we find the honourable member for Eden-Monaro marching into this place and suggesting that we should have more centralisation and not less centralisation. </PARA>

What the Prime Minister wants, with his republican push, is to centralise all power in Canberra, all power in his own hands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech we have just heard from the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper) was the sort of speech I would expect from honourable members on the other side when we talk about macro-economic reform. They are more than happy to impose that kind of reform on workers and ordinary people, but they run away from the reform which will improve efficiency in this country and save billions of dollars for business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we talking about in this debate? Let me give the House an example, for which I will use the island state of Tasmania. In doing that, let me clearly say that I am not drawing any conclusions by using Tasmania. It is a wonderful part of Australia, but Tasmania can very easily provide the  summary for what is wrong with government in Australia. It might interest honourable gentlemen opposite to know that in 1988 there were 302,333 voters enrolled by the Electoral Commission in Tasmania. Tasmania has a Legislative Assembly of 35 members and a Legislative Council of 19 members, and in 1988 each member of the Tasmania state parliament represented 5,598 enrolled voters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an originating state of the Australian federation, Tasmania is entitled to a minimum of five members of the House of Representatives and representation equal to the other states in the Senate, so that gives it 12 senators&mdash;that is, Tasmania has one senator for every 25,194 voters. Each Tasmanian member of the House of Representatives represents some 10,000 voters fewer than the mainland equivalent. The pay is the same, mind you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members think that is a little rough, another figure is that in Tasmania there are 49 local government bodies&mdash;and that is in 1976 figures. There is a local council for every 8,072 enrolled voters, so honourable members should sit back and work out how many councillors there are in the 49 councils and how many people each councillor represents. That is what is wrong with government in Australia today. The cost of running Tasmania impacts on the mainland states. Tasmania receives Commonwealth grants that per capita are seven times greater than those for my state of Victoria. It is not that I do not support fiscal distributions, but the example I have given shows that we in Victoria are paying for inefficient government in Tasmania. In fact, it can be argued that the largest industry in Tasmania is government&mdash;an unproductive industry&mdash;and right throughout Australia a similar situation is occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home state of Victoria there are now 205 councils. In my electorate, the council of Pyalong represents 625 people; it has a shire hall, a shire engineer and a shire secretary. The Cain government, to its credit, tried to reform government. It went through a consultative program, but it was a mistake because the conservatives objected to it; all those rural councillors with their little patches of dirt objected to it. There was a great furore throughout Victoria, as the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) will well remember, as he was then in the opposition to the Victorian government and probably was opposing such reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Kennett government, to its credit, is doing that reform. It is not asking anyone&mdash;there is no consultation&mdash;but it is just ramming home the reform, which will, hopefully, reduce the number of councils in Victoria. The savings can be  huge. Billions of dollars can be saved from the reform of government and the removal of regulations from business. It is the macro-reform that everyone is too frightened to tackle. The opponents of reform are always the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the intergovernmental committee when it existed. That was a committee which was established by state and federal governments to look at reform of government. It was funded by state and federal governments. Its offices were in Hobart and I was this parliament's representative until 1988 when, because the states refused to give any more funding, it was abolished. As usual, the states wanted the Commonwealth to pick up the entire tab. So I have bit of history on the reform of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee produced a number of reports identifying areas where savings could be made. I am not talking about mickey mouse savings but big money&mdash;big savings for business, big savings for the community at large&mdash;through macro reform. The usual snide comments are coming from the other side. Those opposite want macro reform for the wage earner, but they will not look at macro reform&mdash;through constitutional reform and government reform&mdash;for the country. Through its research the intergovernmental committee has all the evidence we need to establish the case for government reform; it is unarguable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example of the need for reform. There are four state seats wholly or partly within the boundaries of my federal electorate of McEwen, an area of roughly 20,000 square kilometres. Each one has a state member of parliament. The Victorian parliament&mdash;do not ask me why&mdash;still has an upper house. For each lower house seat there is an upper house seat with two representatives. So within the boundaries of my federal seat there are nine state members of parliament, all being paid at the same rate as a federal member, less $500. That was a pretty good trick the state pulled years ago&mdash;we cop the blame; they get the pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there are nine state members of parliament within the boundaries of my federal seat. It takes nine state members to do what one federal member does. But what is the reaction when this parliament talks about reforming government? We hear, `No, we will not go down that track and save money for people'. We do not hear of any serious attempt to remove restraints on business. And why is that? The answer is: vested interest, as the Cain government found out when it tried to reform government. The conservatives&mdash;the rural National Party councillors there&mdash;went off their cotton-picking brains about it; they really did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states of Australia are accidents of history&mdash;that is all they are. They were six independent colonies that did not like each other or get along with each other and were forced to federate because of the threat of Russian invasion. If honourable members opposite had learned their history, they would understand that the boundaries are artificial and have no relevance whatsoever to the economic needs of Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who do not know, the border between Victoria and South Australia is the southern bank of the Murray River. That is an anachronism. The Murray River, like all big rivers, changes course; the southern bank moves. So is the border the southern bank at flood, the southern bank at low water, or the southern bank plus the bit of land on the other side where the natural watercourse forms a sort of a levee system? What is the border? As a lawyer who formerly practised in the Murray River area, I can tell the House that the question is not a joke; it raises enormous constitutional problems for all the towns along the Murray River. For example, if a body is found somewhere on the Murray, there is a dispute about who retrieves it and which police force handles the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we need this in the 20th century? Do we really need that kind of restraint, that kind of stupidity between the states, when surely we are today a national entity with a national government&mdash;a country identified as Australia? Yet every time anyone stands up and says, `Reform of government is a necessity', what do we get? For a start, those opposite will oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall Malcolm Fraser, when he was Prime Minister, supporting reform of section 24 of the constitution, the nexus, which requires Senate representation to be half the number of the House of Representatives. That means we now have 12 senators for each state instead of the original 10. Malcolm Fraser supported reform of section 24 and his party supported reform of section 24 because that made commonsense. When it went to a referendum, what did honourable members on the other side of the House do? Typically, they opposed it. So section 24 still exists and we cannot reform the number of lower house seats because to do so would mean increasing Senate representation&mdash;and who needs more senators? It is supposed to be a states house, so why should there be more? Why should Tasmania have 12 senators when it has only 305,000-odd enrolled voters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do honourable members opposite support reform like this? Never.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Government speakers today, and in this debate last November, have affirmed the true nature of this motion as they have waffled their way through the issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion is a transparent sham and it is an ideological regurgitation for more centralised political and economic control from Canberra. It is certainly not what the motion implies. It is not about reforms, whether those reforms be in terms of efficiency, greater democracy or, importantly, accountability enhancements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the motion has the same function as the sports rorts whiteboard of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) as she revealed last evening. It is philosophically driven. It is full of political bias. It is subjective. It is a figment of someone's imagination. It is ethically bankrupt and, most importantly, it flouts our constitutional foundation and practices. As my colleague the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) said, in part, in November:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member would have us go full circle. He abolishes the state governments and almost all municipalities to satisfy his `overgoverned' complaint, and then he finds that his new structure can work effectively only by creating an administrative system almost identical, but with different names, to the one that he has abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our constitution relies on splitting legislative power between the States and the Commonwealth. This means that the States and only the states can make laws about certain things . . . and only the Commonwealth can legislate about certain other things . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Separating law-making in this way was seen by those who framed the Constitution as a way of checking a central government's power, or reducing the changes of government tyranny. This is the basic premise of federalism and is as relevant today as it was when James Madison advocated this form of government during the debates over the adoption of the American Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>However, arguments can be made to the effect that a constitution framed in the days of the horse and buggy might not be relevant in all its detail in the 1990s. Indeed, the High Court has responded to this argument but only by granting more and more legislative powers to the Commonwealth. This can be seen, of course, in the court's treatment of the external affairs and corporations powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, therefore, that the overlapping of functions and consequent bickering about divisions between the tiers of government have gone on since federation, coming formally on the public agenda in referendums and the constitutional discussions that have emerged over many years. As Robert Garran, in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Prosper the Commonwealth</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It ought not to be difficult to express in the text of the Constitution the intention to devolve on the states part of the responsibility for the administration of federal laws. It may be difficult to educate our federal administrators to a self-discipline which will counter their natural inclination to keep all the strings in their own hands. But I do not think that even that need be impossible.</PARA>
<PARA>At the academic level, Hugh Emy has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I came from Britain to Australia in 1969, I must confess that my belief in federalism was lukewarm. I was struck more by its inefficiencies or irrationalities. There seemed to be too many politicians, too many demarcation disputes over which government should do what, a good deal of administrative overlap and blurred lines of accountability&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and wait for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">having now lived in Australia for over twenty years, I am more convinced of the existence of significant socio-cultural and economic differences between the states.

<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . twenty years on, I have a greater regard for `old-fashioned' constitutional principles such as separation of powers and [their associated] checks and balances.</PARA>
<PARA>At the political level, the then South Australian Labor Premier, John Bannon, said in a 1986 oration:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Garran's statement provides the basis for a fundamental move towards innovative democracy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>note that he said `innovative democracy'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and offers a real chance to `do it better'.</PARA>
<PARA>In his 1990-91 new federalism strategy, the then Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the experience of the years tell us that there are important services which would be improved if the Federal Government were not directly involved in their delivery.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that there were two objectives, and he explained what those objectives were, but he made this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a national strategy; but the co-operation of the States and local government is essential . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it is now history to note that Bob Hawke was forced to castrate his new federalism initiative by the highly effective intervention of his then leadership rival, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who ensured that any future move to correct the imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states would not enjoy a bipartisan climate. The honourable member for Blaxland warned at the time that a possible substantial increase in state revenue powers under the new federalism and the consequent dismembering of the national government were&mdash;to use his words&mdash;`one of the gravest dangers we face as a nation'. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an agenda being pushed by federalists who don't believe in a national economy, in a national government, who want to turn back the clock to the 19th century. When I was Treasurer, I made it clear that I would never append my name to an Executive Council minute giving power to the States. This has no chance. It's not on. Not for the Labor Party. Not for the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>However, only last week, Labor Premier Goss of Queensland, when he warned the federal government that it had failed to reform federal-state financial relations and that the Council of Australian Governments could fold this year, said that the bulk of COAG achievements during the past three years&mdash;such as the national electricity grid, the national training authority and the creation of the Australian Financial Institutions Commission&mdash;resulted from `the co-operation and leadership of the states'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that Commonwealth involvement was not essential, `because the issues related to matters that were state responsibilities'. He said federally created bureaucratic structures designed to `look over the shoulders of the states'&mdash;and note that this is one of the government's own mob talking&mdash;were ridiculous and needed to be eliminated, and that the federal government collected `far too much in the way of revenue and the states far too little'. He said that to survive COAG would have to `steer a middle course between a tired states rights drum and Canberra's disregard for its promise that the reform of the federal relationship would involve two-way traffic'. He finished by saying this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless COAG continues to operate in a co-operative spirit, and unless COAG sees two-way traffic in terms of concessions being made&mdash;not only by the States but by the Commonwealth as well, particularly in the area of Commonwealth-State financial relations&mdash;then I think it simply will not survive . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also said that the problem of vertical fiscal imbalance remained `unresolved'. This motion, therefore, has little to offer other than yet another tired philosophical and ideological whimper. It has the half-hearted support from the government colleagues of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). It is criticised roundly by high profile contemporary Labor leaders such as Wayne Goss. It simply mouths the `make it or break it' push by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as he perpetuates division and diversion. But, most importantly, it does not have the popular support of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, we do have too much government. To take up the point made by the honourable member for Fisher, I for one believe that we can use citizens' initiatives and referenda  not as a replacement for, but as a strong supplement to, the Westminster system&mdash;and I make no apology for saying that publicly. This motion clearly fails its own tests and I firmly oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have only a very short time in which to speak&mdash;and I cannot possibly cover all the issues I would like to speak about&mdash;but I will do so with great passion and enthusiasm. As a former member of the Victorian parliament and, prior to that, as a legal practitioner in an area separated by the state border of New South Wales and Victoria, I am familiar with the frustrations and problems of unnecessary differences in law. As a former state minister for health, local government and planning and for minerals and energy and mines, and as a shadow minister for some of those areas as well, I can assure members of this House that I have a very passionate and strong belief in reform in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons that I am here in this place is that I believe the systems of government throughout the whole of Australia need reform urgently. I believe that they have not been performing adequately and that, unless they do, the people of Australia will be entitled to demand, and will in fact receive, reform which may well throw the baby out with the bathwater. I can also tell the House&mdash;from my experience in life and from my experience of the various levels of government that I have worked with and been part of&mdash;that any tendency in Australia to further concentrate power in one large central government will be a grave error and a grave mistake. I cannot for any reason support the continuation of further centralism of government in Australia. I say that not as a member of the Liberal Party necessarily, but as an Australian and a regional Australian&mdash;as someone from the bush who knows the tyranny of distance, who knows how people can be disadvantaged because of the difficulties of communication and the extra costs and who also realises that the best form of government and the best outcome of government is one that is a true democracy, one that guarantees people access to their representatives, and one that guarantees accountability and scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, let us just look at the recent examples of what the continuation of increasing central government is doing to our democracy and to our parliament. Just this week we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) withdraw from Question Time for two days of the four-day sitting week, under the guise of increasing scrutiny of his other ministers. But the fact is that, in making that claim on behalf of this massive central government that has grown in Australia, he is claiming, and misrepresenting, that the people have adequate scrutiny and opportunities, through their elected representatives, in Question Time to scrutinise the actions of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the number of sitting days of the House of Representatives and, therefore, the number of Question Times in this Commonwealth are dismally few; and the Prime Minister is going to reduce by 50 per cent the opportunity to question the first minister. This is an extraordinary illustration of what naked power can do. From my point of view and from experience, the less power central government has in basic matters, the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I would like to say that I do believe that we are overgoverned and I believe&mdash;and I have said for many years&mdash;that there are far too many state members of parliament. I was one of them and I was able to say that and put that on record while I was a state member of parliament. There is no doubt that each level of government needs a massive shake-up. What we really do need to achieve is cooperative federalism. That ought to be the challenge for all of us in the few years that remain in this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are examples of a growing and encouraging tendency towards more cooperative federalism in Australia. That is coming about, might I add, because of the example of the people from the bush in regional Australia, such as in places in north-east Victoria, in Albury-Wodonga, and in the Riverina, where the communities are forgetting state borders and working together for common good. The outcomes are excellent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have a basic health plan for Albury-Wodonga, virtually disregarding the state boundaries. I might add that that has been done with a lot of difficulty and opposition from some levels of bureaucracy. We already have a model for post-secondary education delivery across the border. We already have an excellent adult education service operating mainly from Wodonga, delivering services into New South Wales. All of those were achieved with great difficulty, I might add. </PARA>

<PARA>Like the last speaker, the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman), I know already that I do not have enough time. I have 10 minutes and, quite frankly, the impact on our pensioners and self-funding retirees is so drastic that I could speak for 10 hours rather than 10 minutes. I say to the House that we should be approaching this issue in a thoroughly bipartisan fashion. My concern in this debate is not to attack the government at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well overdue indeed, as my colleague says. While the terms of reference were agreed on in October, the actual appointment of consultants, Ageing Agendas, to conduct the review was announced only yesterday. I welcome that appointment and the first report is due in July this year. I hope that it also focuses on the extreme need to change the law on this matter so that elderly Australians are not disadvantaged by the Department of Social Security and the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I make is a generalisation. It is that pensioners are being hit by a double whammy; they are being hit with the double-dipping of taxation. It does not appear to have registered with the government just precisely what is being done. I will give the House an example. Mr and Mrs X have shares that increase in value. Because the shares have gone up, say, by $5 each, their pension is reduced because the amount of capital gain, or rise in the share value, is deemed as income. This is unjust, because they do not get the money until they sell the shares. Nonetheless, their pension is reduced by 50c in the dollar for the increase in their asset. That is a 50 per cent tax&mdash;there is no other way of describing it&mdash;because it is 50 per cent of each dollar being taken back from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the first part of the whammy. The double whammy comes when they eventually sell the shares and then they have to pay capital gains tax on the money on which they have already been taxed 50 per cent by having their pension reduced. I see the next speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), sitting in the chamber and he must agree that this is true, that this is the way it works. I am sure that when he speaks he will agree that this is not appropriate. This is one of the areas that must be changed. No member of this parliament can possibly agree with a situation where pensioners, whether they receive social security or veterans pensions, are chopped twice on their investment, first by having their pension reduced by 50c in the dollar, which is exactly a 50 per cent tax, and then again when they eventually sell the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of people who have come to me is quite extraordinary. I cannot begin to tell honourable members how many people in my electorate alone&mdash;and I am sure in every other electorate in Australia&mdash;have been hurt and damaged financially and caused incredible extra worry and concern by the way this is working. It must be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an example, a couple from Coffs Harbour, who invested $25,000 in property trusts through MLC and $4,000 in the ANZ Bank, have had their combined pension reduced by $20 a fortnight. They are actually getting four per cent in cash, but Veterans' Affairs say that the dividend is netting them 25 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. This is totally crazy. Another couple at Bonville say in a letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April last year I applied for and received a part pension paying $103 per week. The Government then changed policy on share type investments and my pension was cut to $17 per week.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason why the pension was cut from $103 to $17 was that the department valued the investments as bringing in an income of $27,813 for the year. That is not a bad income. However, the reality was that that couple only received $8,900. Where is the justice in that? Where is the equity that we are all so concerned about in this parliament? That couple's pension was reduced from $103 to $17 because, although their actual income was $8,900, they were assessed as getting $27,813. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another instance is of a man from Nambucca Heads who sold a number of good quality shares when the provisions were announced in September 1992. He was, of course, disappointed at the backdown. As he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can imagine my disappointment when the Government backed away from that a week or two before the implementation of the "unrealised capital gain" thing . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would though like to air my displeasure at the Government's handling of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government waited until September 1993 to reverse its policy, re unrealised capital growth/ Income Testing, on shares purchased prior to August 19 1992 . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion the Government should make amends by allowing those so affected the option to repurchase shares up to equal value of the same kind of shares they sold.</PARA>
<PARA>Part of the injustice is that people were forced into a position where they thought they had to sell their shares. </PARA>
<PARA>Another couple from Kempsey wrote to me about their situation. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had the first deduction of $60-00 a week in September, 1993 . . . now they have reduced it again another $30-00 . . . we are Part Pensioners receiving a monthly payment from G.I.O Trust No2 . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We find that this is grossly unfair Legislation which discriminates against Pensioners and Superannuants.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly does. Another example is from a lady from Nambucca Heads. Her situation was that in 1992 she was receiving a part pension equivalent to $4,300 a year, plus benefits. In 1993 she received a letter from the Department of Social Security informing her that it had cancelled the entire pension and benefits. She was told that the estimate of what she may receive in income from investments was $61,500. That was what the department said she was going to receive. Her actual taxable income, as per her tax return, was only $23,600. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and on with examples. There are so many people who are in this situation. A gentleman from Coffs Harbour wrote to me. His wife receives a part age pension and an income from managed investments. She had a declining return from investments, and the pension has been reduced. The Department of Social Security estimated their income at $1,800 more than they actually received. And so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another couple from Urunga first received the age pension in August 1992. Their income from a GIO monthly income trust was $778 per month, and from the pension was $249. The income from the trust from August 1992 to January 1994 ranged from $714 to $778 per month. The pension rose from $249 to $262 in July 1993. In September 1993 it was reduced to $205, and in January 1994 it was reduced to $170. And this is just one of the many situations that exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another couple from Coffs Harbour received identical dividends of $50.07 quarterly over the last 12 months, a total of $200.28. That is $7.70 per fortnight. However, the Department of Veterans' Affairs says they are earning at the rate of 17.13 per cent per unit, or $16.49 per fortnight. They actually get $7.70 cash in hand per fortnight, but the department says that they get $16.49. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I have to finish. I have received many cries for help from the elderly and other people around Australia. We must make sure that the review announced yesterday is effective and that it gets results. We have to restore justice and equity and fairness to the elderly of Australia. In particular, we have to stop the double whammy, whereby we take 50 per cent in tax on pensions, and then charge capital gains tax when they sell their shares. That situation is absolutely unfair, and that is not what Australia is about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to participate in this debate and to indicate to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) that we on this side of the House have no objection to the terms of his motion and agree to the wording of the motion, which is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House recognises the need for fair and just treatment of shares and investments owned by Australians of pensionable age in the context of social security and veterans' affairs payments.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly simple and straightforward principle and, of course, it is something that we on this side of the House support. Where we may come into some disagreement is in the process of how one determines what is a fair and just treatment of shares and investments and putting the whole question of shares and investments in the perspective of the total social welfare system, particularly as it applies to older Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a few points in response to the contribution of the honourable member for Cowper to this debate. I thought we were actually going to be talking about the principles of how a country and a government establish a fair system for retirement incomes and for managing our ageing population and ensuring that as a government we are able to ensure that all Australians get fair access to government support, but bearing in mind that, when people have some of their own resources and have some of their own assets to care for themselves, they have a lesser need for government support. It is those who have not had the opportunity to build up assets who get a greater level of government support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not quite realise that we were going to have a debate about the cases of individual constituents. I could have brought in my file of cases. We all have constituents come to our electorate offices with cases where they feel they have been unjustly treated. In some cases they have been unfairly treated. As a local member, when I have a constituent come to me saying, `The department has assessed my assets in this way or my income in this way, yet here is the real situation', I get on the phone to my regional office of the Department of Social Security and say, `Excuse me, my constituent Mrs whoever or Mr whoever has this problem. You seem to have made this assessment incorrectly', and the department has a full process for reviewing all assessments that it makes. In many cases, yes, there have been errors made. Of course that is going to be the case, because let us not forget that the Department of Social Security makes some eight million payments a fortnight. So of course there are going to be errors made in determinations from time to time. One of our jobs, whatever party we are in, is to look after our constituents and to raise those individual cases where there have been errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about the principle behind this measure, and I also want to highlight the fact that I agree that there needs to be a review of all of the different processes that the government has utilised in assessing various assets and income levels and determining what is a fair amount of pension that persons should get, dependent upon their assets and incomes. I was one of the people on this side of the House who pushed quite strongly, along with a number of my colleagues, for the review that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has announced. The very fact that, firstly, the government reviewed its treatment of shares last September in response to the high level of concern about the impact of that and, secondly, the government has now introduced this major review of the whole impact of the income and assets test, is a reflection of the fact that the government does listen and does respond and does act in a sensible way to ensure that the policy mix that it puts in place is achieving its positive aims and is not having those negative unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think it is very important to highlight the review that the minister has announced and what will be occurring over the next few months. The objectives of the review will be to examine the rationale of income and assets testing in the context of the government retirement income objectives; to examine the conceptual framework, design principles and the actual operation of the pensions, income and asset tests, including perceptions of their complexity on the part of social security and service pensioners, et cetera. It goes through quite a lot of detail about the scope of the review. What is also important is that there will be a major consultation process engaged in and there is a reference group being established which will involve peak retiree and veterans organisations and the finance and superannuation industry, as well as the departments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is an important review and it is something that we should not just pass over briefly. It is an important opportunity for all people who are affected and for the peak organisations representing people in the aged sector in this country to have a say and to have that impact on that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Cowper talked about some individual cases; and he referred to part-pensioners who, because of their shares, have lost some further pension. What the honourable member for Cowper did not highlight was that, when the government first introduced this measure before we then amended it in the subsequent budget, it was going to raise some $80 million. In that same budget we announced a $120 million extension of the fringe benefits process for all part-pensioners. It was because we needed to find some of the money to pay for that that we looked at a further targeting process within the assessment of pensions and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have decreased considerably the impact of this measure by making it only shares purchased after this decision was first announced, which cuts the impact of this measure down to two per cent of pensioners. Only two per cent of pensioners are affected, yet there are thousands&mdash;a much greater percentage&mdash;of pensioners who are going to gain real benefits because we have extended the provision of the health care card and other fringe benefits to all part-pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this financial year the amount of money that we are providing in direct support to the aged care sector by giving them access to a health care card and giving them access to a whole range of other fringe benefits that the Commonwealth supports is going to be close to $200 million; and we have negotiated with state governments to extend their fringe benefits processes to those other areas as well. A far greater percentage of pensioners are going to benefit from that measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not hear the honourable member for Cowper talk about the 8,000 to 10,000 pensioners in his electorate&mdash;and his electorate is probably pretty similar to mine&mdash;who are now going to be eligible for the fringe benefits, which by any measure work out to around a $1,500 benefit per year in access to lower cost pharmaceuticals, free health care, dental services, the telephone concession, railway concessions and a range of other measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put this debate into balance. There has not been a lot of balance in the opposition's contribution on this measure. People have got to understand that the government does not have a bottomless pit of money to enable it to introduce new measures. When we see that we have to introduce a measure which is a fair and equitable measure, such as provision of fringe benefits to a whole range of additional people, we have to say, `How do we pay for that?'. The government said, `We will accrue some of the money by looking at the current fairness which operates within the assets and income test'. There was an inequity occurring in the income and assets test regarding the treatment of shares and managed investments compared with other investments. So the government said, `Why should one group of pensioners who have investments in one area not be targeted, whereas pensioners and retirees who have benefits or investments in another area are targeted and their capital growth is measured?'. So the government said, `We are going to introduce both'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member that there were some unintended consequences. Because I disagreed with the retrospectivity of it, and I pushed very hard to have that measure introduced from the date that it was announced&mdash;not going back. That is what the government did. When it listened to the complaints from people across this parliament, it did make that change. We now have in place a system which is fairer, but we are going to review the whole lot. I agree with the honourable member for Cowper that it is a very complex system and it does need to be reviewed; it needs to be simplified; and it needs to be better understood by both the veterans and the pensioners and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us understand and put this matter into perspective. We, as a government, have made major improvements in the provision of aged care support services and income support across the whole country, both to ordinary pensioners and to service pensioners. There has been a major improvement in the value of the pension and in what we are allowing people to gain in fringe benefits. None of that seems to be taken into account. To do that we have had a massively increasing social security budget over the last decade. We are proud of that and we are happy to do that, but there will always need to be a time to target. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not been in this place for even 12 months yet, but my concern is that it seems that in excess of 60 per cent of my constituent inquiries are about this matter. I probably have even more pensioners in the electorate of Lyne, in places such as Forster, Tuncurry, Taree and Port Macquarie, than the honourable members for Cowper and Moreton have in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that people were not given enough warning. They have spent the latter part of their working lives creating a nest egg and planning for their retirement. They have considered what they are going to be doing for the latter part of their lives, what their income will be, and have taken into account the key elements of the circumstances at the time as far as a pension or a part-pension is concerned. All of a sudden the government moved the goal posts. That is what we are talking about here: not giving these people enough warning to get their houses in order. Maybe they needed to have worked for another five years if they had to live off managed investments as they do now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This heartless legislative approach by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) is undoubtedly one of the great embarrassments of this government during its current term of office. The honourable member for Moreton has pointed out that he has had just as many constituent inquiries as we have. I have probably sent as many people off for reviews as the honourable member for Moreton has, and I have not struck one success yet where a pension has been reviewed and it has been found that a mistake was made. So we are talking about the policy as much as its implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has introduced the most incoherent and impractical formula to test the level of unrealised capital gain that I have ever seen&mdash;for both share portfolios and  managed investments. It frightens me to see pensioners on both social security and veterans affairs payments coming into my offices in Taree and Port Macquarie totally confused, surprised, frustrated and ultimately outraged by the actions of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are in such a state, not only because they are unable to work out the connection between the supposed increase in unrealised capital gains and the real cuts in their fortnightly pensions but also because they cannot believe the government could be so callous in its revenue raising measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said it before and I will continue to say that these people have worked hard all their lives and have done the right thing by the government throughout their lives. The majority of them are not the high-fliers; they are not the silver spoon set; they are simply storing away a small investment for security purposes. The great irony with this legislation is that it is the Minister for Social Security&mdash;we hear so much in this place about social security from the government&mdash;who has taken away the one thing for which the majority of these people have worked hard all their lives: security in retirement. The government has taken it away. What an inherent contradiction that the Minister for Social Security is the one who takes from the elderly just that: social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the budget debacle that ripped this government apart, some horse-trading was done with this legislation, which saw unrealised capital gains on shares assessed as income only if purchased after August 1992. Therefore, any share portfolios taken out before that date are now exempt. That still caught a lot of people because the people that were assessed on their total share portfolio before that change turned around and sold their shares. They saw no other way of dealing with the problem. They did not want the complication in their lives, so they sold their share portfolio. If they bought back in, they were going to be assessed after the changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The haphazard approach by the government over the history of these changes raises several questions. For example, why on earth has the retrospective nature of the legislation been left in the legislation on share portfolios? Why on earth, if the government so desperately wants to continue with these measures, could it not start from this year's budget so that the pensioner community could have had time to get its financial affairs in order and maintain some sort of personal social security? Why on earth was the legislation regarding managed investments left untouched? What is the difference that the government sees that means managed investments should be treated differently from share portfolios?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I heard one of the most outrageous defence claims made by this government when it was in the process of introducing the shares legislation. It was arguing at the time that this was not going to be a big deal and it used the case of managed investments as its example. It argued that, since no-one really complained about managed investments, the same will be true on the shares issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that no-one within the community knew about any of these changes until they started to see massive cuts in their fortnightly pensions. In many cases, this was not until their pension was cut completely. In a speech on the social security amendment bill the other day, I mentioned Mr Baker of Port Macquarie, who has had his pension completely cut. All he did was move $200,000 from an interest-bearing deposit in a bank into a managed investment. He was allowed to have it sitting in the bank, but he was not allowed to have it sitting in a managed investment. He had $150-something a fortnight in pension whilst he had that money in the bank. As soon as he put it in a managed investment portfolio, he lost his pension completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen major changes. By introducing these legislative changes, this government has moved the goal posts, as I said before. The real issue is that people plan for many years for their retirement based on the rules of the day. This government moved the goal posts. It removed that security that the pensioner community had before these changes were introduced. The government cannot try to convince me that it flagged this legislation to the pensioner community because there are still many people within my electorate and right throughout Australia who are only now realising just what the government has actually done to affect their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To emphasise my point, I will quote from a media article from the last few weeks which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 19 January. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial advisers received an expected flood of phone calls from pensioners last week, following the impact of the latest quarterly review of pensions by the Department of Social Security. The surge in local and overseas equity markets during the past few months has delivered some spectacular returns to investors in direct shares and managed funds. But the assessment of unrealised capital gains under the pension income test had led to big pension cuts for many.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the unrealised capital gain does not put bread and butter on the table each week. It does not put petrol in the car. It does not pay the rates. Let us not kid ourselves, the increase in the equity markets is not being truly reflected in the pension cuts. The formula being used is so overexaggerated that it inflates the capital gain enormously. I just wish the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) was with me every time I interview a pensioner when he says, `If I were earning the money on my investment that the formula says I am, I sure wouldn't be complaining'. They would not be complaining, but they are not earning that money. The money is not in their pockets. Comments such as these emphasise the unrealistic nature of the formula being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair to the government, I think that it has realised its blunder on this issue, even though it is not for truly compassionate reasons. Instead, as part of a budget backroom deal, it brought forward the exemption date on the shares issue. It has also announced a review of the current income and assets test for pensioners, which is well overdue. It was promised before Christmas. The review is obviously now well behind schedule and the minister only just announced yesterday that Ageing Agendas will conduct the review. Let us hope that it is a truly independent review and not something that we may have witnessed on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> program on TV. I think this review so far has simply been a vehicle to take the heat off the government on this issue, so that when people start complaining about this ridiculous legislation, the minister can pass the buck and say that he is holding a review, so that he looks like he is doing something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the government and the minister to take this review seriously and allow it to operate totally independently and away from their intrusive hand. Most importantly, I challenge this government and this minister to get out and meet some of the people being affected by this legislation, and to sit down and talk with them, and to listen to their story to see just what the government is doing to the lives of some of our elderly Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite interesting to listen to those opposite give their views on this matter. What a lot of hype and carry on. What a load of scare tactics there are going around. There is no need for us to go and get every pensioner in Australia on their knees wondering what on earth is happening. A bit of simple explanation will give it to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the statement of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), who said that pensioners kept shares and investments for security purposes, and then he went on to blast `security' as in social security. May I advise the previous speaker that security purposes in my book&mdash;when I am thinking about investment and my future&mdash;are for when I retire. Surely, the nest egg that I am building and that some of these people have built is for retirement, not just for them to hide away and not use, so that they can then sponge on the government for social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I would like to explain very carefully and simply what the investment shares review is all about. For the information of honourable members opposite, 95 per cent of supplementary shares data collection forms have now been completed, and this was done by the end of December 1993. Currently, there are about 40,000 clients with post 18 August 1992 shares, and they have been recorded and included in the bulk reassessment. Pre 19 August 1992 share assessments have been updated using the latest dividend data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at January 1994, the update had found that 198,600 pensioners were recorded as having managed investments and/or post 18 August 1992 shares. Of these, some pensioners held management investments only, and some held shares only. It needs to be noted that, owing to the offsetting arrangements, only the combined impact of managed investment and share assessment can be measured for bulk assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus we find at January 1994 that approximately 103,400 pensioners had no change in their rate of payment. Of the remaining 95,200, 52 per cent recorded an increased pension payment averaging an increase of $3 a week, and 48 per cent recorded a decrease in their pension payment with an average reduction of $6 per week. A further 1,100 clients had their pension cancelled. These increases and decreases resulted from a general fall in interest rates and the associated reduction in crediting rates on life products such as insurance bonds, and also from the relative stability in rates of return on shares and managed investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to be noted therefore that, while rates of return on these products over the past three months have been quite strong, they have not been all that different from those in the three months to the end of December 1992, which have now dropped out of the 12-month period for calculating rates of return. Pensioners whose payments vary because of the update have been notified of payment changes and have been advised how, if they required further information about their investment assessment, they could contact their local financial information service. It is also noted that, in general, the bulk update proceeded smoothly with very little media comment and no extra volume of calls to FIS or the teleservice centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to assist with the understanding of those changes and what the new rules are that apply needs to be separated out for comprehension. Changes to managed investments that took place, effective in March 1993, comprised the following: the removal of the artificial distinction between market linked investments and accruing return investments, so that all managed investments are now assessed on their actual rate of return&mdash;before that, they had had a capped rate of return of 11 per cent; and the allowing of losses on all managed investments to be offset against gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pre-March 1993 there was no cap on managed investments that were clarified as accruing return investments&mdash;for example, friendly society bonds&mdash;because since 1988 the capital growth on these investments was assessed as income. Therefore, the only change to accruing return investments was to allow losses on other managed investments to be offset against gains. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, some people gained from the change and others lost. For example, when assessments on managed investments were updated in September, around 48 per cent of pensioners with managed investments had a change in their rate of pension. Of these, 40 per cent had an increase and 60 per cent had a decrease. Most of the increases and decreases were less than $10 per week. Initial information on the January update is that the number of pension increases and decreases are similar to those that occurred in September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be inappropriate to grandfather managed investments made before 18 August 1992, as has occurred with shares, because a savings clause for managed investments would be overly generous for most pensioners, given that they have been assessed already on an accruing rather than a realisation basis for around five years. Some people with losses would be worse off because they could no longer offset these losses during the term of the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has initiated an independent review, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has already explained, of the pension income and assets testing arrangements. The treatment of investments will be covered in that review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us now discuss how the government will implement the new rules for the treatment of shares acquired after 18 August 1992. These changes apply only&mdash;`only', I stress&mdash;to shares acquired post 18 August 1992 and have been applied progressively since 23 September 1993. New clients&mdash;that is, new clients after 23 September&mdash;had the new rules applied from the date of the first payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To identify existing clients who acquired shares after 18 August 1992 the Department of Social Security sent a supplementary shares review form in October last year to around 25,000 pensioners who were most likely to have acquired shares after 18 August 1992. They were pensioners who had invested in new share floats since that date&mdash;for example, Woolworths; pensioners who had indicated that they had incurred brokerage fees over the past 12 months; those who had held shares in companies that have had a rights issue since 18 August 1992; and those pensioners with portfolios valued at $50,000 or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of forms have now been returned and each case has been assessed. The new rules have been applied. Each pensioner affected has received advice to make the matter clear. Those pensioners or their nominees who have not returned their form or contacted the department will be contacted shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent increases in the value of shares may lead to some pension reductions as the new rules are applied, but pensioners will still be better off overall as only 50c in pension is lost for every dollar in income. In addition, the rate of return at a maximum of 50 per cent ensures that no share can be assessed as having a rate of return in excess of 50 per cent. Therefore, many shares where the rate of return has recently been increased will receive the benefit of the 50 per cent cap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new rules will now be applied progressively to other groups of pensioner shareholders who were not sent a supplementary review form because they were considered less likely to have acquired shares previous to 18 August. The government, as I said, has also initiated an independent review of pension income and assets testing arrangements and the treatment of investments will be covered in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To explain the contradiction between the Social Security treatment and their tax treatment: the government is supportive of allocated pensions. They can play a valuable role in the retirement income system. In recognition of this, the tax treatment of allocated pension provides substantial concessions that encourage self-provision in the form of these investments. However, added concessions through Social Security will be illogical and result in tilting the balance of government provision away from those in need and consequently increase government pension outlays. The government's proposed change recognises that allocated pensions have a hybrid nature displaying some characteristics of investment in superannuation and characteristics of managed investments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Yet this House has failed, through no fault of honourable members on this side of the House, to be fair and just in the treatment of pensioners who hold shares and investments. I refer in particular to the government's treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares and investments as income for the purposes of calculating a pension.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the fifth time I have spoken in this place on this issue. I think that reflects fairly badly on the government, which has shown arrogance and unwillingness to be fair and reasonable in its treatment of pensioners. Today we hear the government describe these fine Australians as `spongers'. It is only because of my personal respect for the honourable member opposite that I do not name her, because otherwise her office in Launceston would be deluged with hordes of these so-called spongers. I acknowledge that the government made some concessions on this issue in the last budget, when it took out the retrospectivity provision. However, that response was too little. Pensioners are virtually prohibited from investing in our nation because, if they do and there is even minor rise in the value of their shares or investments, they will have their pensions cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to relate to the House the story of one pensioner in my electorate of Stirling who had some shares. She inherited them from her husband. They had held them for quite a number of years. Prior to the announcement in the budget of changes to the rules for assessing pensions, there had been quite a lot of media attention on this issue, and justifiably so. Anyhow, like many other pensioners, this old lady had become frustrated at the government's arrogance. She had waited too long, on a meagre income each week, for the government to show some compassion on this issue. So she consulted her financial advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They told her, `The government does not care about the elderly in society. If you want to survive, you need your pension. So your only option is to sell your shares'. She sold her shares. Twenty-four hours later, the government did another of its backflips. It repealed the retrospectivity. That should have been good for this dear old lady, but it was too late for her. She missed out by 24 hours. She sold the little nest egg which she and her husband had scraped together over a number of years before he died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This woman's case illustrates the total disregard the government has shown for the elderly of our society&mdash;or the spongers, as it calls them. One should look at how the government prioritises things. The former Speaker, now government whip, falls off his bike and collects $65,000 of taxpayers' money. The Australian Labor Party is trailing in the polls, so the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) says, `Here's 30 million bucks, Ros. Go and buy some votes in our marginal seats'. What does that tell us? But when pensioners invest in our nation&mdash;the country in which they worked so hard to ensure that our generation and generations to come would enjoy a reasonable standard of living&mdash;the government says, `Oh, their shares have gone up. They have not earned any extra money, but let us penalise them anyway'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cares little for ordinary Australians. It cares only about its own re-election prospects and lining the pockets of former speakers for their own clumsiness. How does the government fund its self-interest? It rips off ordinary Australians. Following the last budget, there were the changes that I talked about earlier. However, I should point out that many pensioners sold their investments unnecessarily, many making a loss. We also have legislation which penalises pensioners for investing in shares and making other investments. This is prohibition. That is the only word for it. Which pensioners in their right mind would invest their money when they know that they will be penalised for it? It defies logic. That, sadly, is a common characteristic of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that a committee is looking into the treatment of pensioners. It will obviously go further than just discussing the treatment of shares and investments. I suggest to honourable members, with regard to this issue, that the committee will recommend the total repealing of this legislation, and quite rightly so. I have talked about this on numerous occasions but it is important to point it out again. It is absolutely ridiculous to treat an increase in the value of one's shares or investment as income when they have not</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is high time the government treated our elderly citizens with the respect and compassion they deserve. It should not describe them as spongers. This issue has proven that the government lacks any compassion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say that this session of backbenchers' business is normally a useful and worthwhile forum, particularly for new members, to bring to their colleagues in the parliament an awareness and understanding of the problems in their electorates and in the community at large. What we are seeing, in fact, is its misuse in the most hypocritical and mischievous kind of way one can imagine. One really has to go back to the 1970s, to the Fraser government which converted the assets test out of the system, actually changed the means test basis of the Australian pension system to be income only and took assets out of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we saw between 1977 and 1982 was this massive shift of capacity from income earning to asset, and the whole pension system was tilted that way. In 1983, when we started to try to correct that, we heard the screams, the shouts and the mass hysteria from those honourable members opposite who were protecting, essentially, those people with substantial assets and wealth who were getting full pensions. We had the hypocrisy of millionaires getting pensions, and those honourable members opposite supported it. The principle was that if one had assets it did not matter; it was only income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since 1983, there has been an ongoing debate as to how to treat people in Australia fairly. So when people retire, whether they put their money into banks, into shares or into property, it should be treated fairly and equally. There is the idea that notional gain is the same as notional interest. So do not take the interest from the bank; let it sit there. That makes it notional. It is not real money; it is only a paper entry; therefore, it should not affect the pension. The fact is that notional gains are real gains and they are able to be realised. That is what this is about. Quite frankly, what the opposition is looking for here is a new form of assets avoidance, that people should transfer their capacity into shares&mdash;put all their assets into shares&mdash;because the capital growth on shares will not be tested. People will be able to get a full pension. It is the old assets test revisited. That is what it is about. We know that; the pensioners federation knows that; all the organisations know that.

The average working Joe was paying for it. Shares are an asset. The increase in share values is realisable&mdash;any day, every day, whenever it is wanted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House calls upon the Government to allow telephone subscribers to indicate their choice not to receive unsolicited telephone calls from telemarketers selling a good or service, by adding an asterisk against their entry in the White Pages telephone directory.</PARA>
<PARA>I was disturbed to read in the parliamentary blue paper today that my motion was described as `Protection from telemarketers'. That is a wrong description of the intent of my motion. I thought I would point that out, because sometimes these things can be misconstrued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would like to refer to an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 8 February 1994, in relation to a slightly different subject, but nonetheless one which carries with it the gist of what is a fundamental criticism of the government's telecommunications policy. The editorial is about bulletin boards. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The political and bureaucratic response to the challenge of communications technology is too often hamfisted and hostile.</PARA>
<PARA>On another subject it comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Visiting Australia last week, the chairman of Microsoft, Mr Bill Gates, was justifiably unimpressed with the narrow, official view of pay TV.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, in dealing with the question of regulation of this particular activity, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor to regulate an activity simply because it is not already regulated.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> was criticising the government's tendency to respond in a ham-fisted way to communications issues and, more often than not, to respond in a way that introduces over-regulation of an important and booming industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the dawn of an age of mass telecommunications. There will be a revolution in telecommunications. There will be all sorts of interactive telecommunications via telecommunication lines and satellite and other such means of communication. There will be some tremendous revolutionary advances in the technology and in the facilities that will be available to the consumer, including householders. So it is important that the government responds in a carefully considered way and, instead of opting to over-regulate, looks to the optimum approach, which is self-regulation by the users and providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion which I have moved today is to allow all telephone subscribers the opportunity to indicate whether they wish to receive unsolicited telephone calls from telemarketers by having an asterisk added against their entry in Telecom's white pages. The unsolicited calls to which I am referring are those whereby the caller attempts to directly market a good or service. Based on the information I have received on this matter through my electorate office, the practice usually entails selling goods or asking for a donation, and that generally causes the subscribers some angst because they are wary of a voice over the phone requesting money or credit card numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not include in this the legitimate and important surveying of opinions of constituents, which is part of the proper representation of constituents in parliament, whether here or in the state parliaments. I believe that is an important part of our democratic process. What I am indicating in this motion is that subscribers, by having an asterisk next to their entry in the white pages, ought to be able to indicate their preference not to receive unsolicited telemarketing calls to their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, we have all received such calls. It is obviously a very important part of our economy. It is a legitimate practice which, according to the chief executive officer of the Australian Direct Marketing Association, Mr Rob Edwards, turns over in excess of $4.5 billion per annum. That is just by the 220 telemarketing companies which are voluntary members of that association. Nevertheless, there are a number of people who find unsolicited telemarketing calls offensive, intrusive and sometimes a gross invasion of privacy, particularly when the call is perhaps received in the middle of the evening meal or in the middle of some other activity which people at home are undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently interviewed on this matter on an ABC morning program and was very heavily supported by listeners who called in with their thoughts on unsolicited calls. Some of their comments were as follows: telemarketing is an invasion of everything; one usually gets the calls at a time when one is most busy during the evening; I regard it as a total invasion of privacy and if I get someone calling me I simply put the phone down and let them gabble on; I agree with the idea of an asterisk; the worst thing is when one is trying to run a business and is with a client and the phone rings and it is one of those organisations trying to get a donation; and it is our right to be annoyed when we get these calls, `Do I want this, do I want that?'. They are just a damn nuisance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is by no means a new problem, but it does appear to be a problem which the government cannot address. In December 1992, Austel released the final report on its inquiry into the privacy implication of telecommunication services. Among Austel's many recommendations were the following aimed at protecting and promoting consumer interests. One was applying a principle of informed consent; another was a committee of consumers, industry and government agencies developing a voluntary framework for dealing with the issues, funding being made available to Austel to service that committee; industry developing codes of conduct dealing with specific aspects of the issues, for example, telemarketing, for approval by the committee; and measures to control the capture and use of personal data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as unsolicited telecommunications are concerned, the telecommunications privacy report defined these as being telecommunications initiated by a business or other organisation to a resident where the resident does not have a continuing relationship with the business or organisation, or where the telecommunication is to persuade the resident to a course of action, that is, to buy goods or services. One of the principal recommendations by Austel in that report on this matter was that the telecommunications privacy committee should oversee the development of a cost-effective process by which consumers who prefer not to receive unsolicited telecommunications may, as far as possible, indicate that preference. Others included the development of appropriate codes of conduct for approval by the committee to deal with intrusion, control of personal data and fair trading issues in relation to unsolicited telecommunications, and the collection and collation of complaints relating to unsolicited calls by the telecommunications industry ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a view that in this case we ought not to go for the ham-fisted approach, that in the case of telemarketing it is quite feasible, and I think proper, for the industry as much as possible to be able to regulate itself, to have a voluntary code of standards. I think that a code of conduct is something that is very strongly supported by, for instance, the Australian Direct Marketing Association. But the problem is that not all telemarketers are members of those types of bodies, and those that are not members may from time to time cause the problems which I have alluded to earlier in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that ADMA has taken the initiative of providing legal assistance to some consumers who have been wronged by miscreant companies, and that it is as keen as I am to ensure a practical solution to help telephone subscribers to be able to indicate their preference. ADMA claims to have no problem with the concept of marking numbers in the phone directory, although it is keen to see the issue of funding addressed or resolved first. In the interim, however, ADMA is continuing with its telephone preference scheme, whereby people who do not wish to be called can telephone ADMA's head office in Sydney to have their name deleted from the lists of all ADMA's member companies. This is, of course, of some benefit to people who are fearful of unsolicited calls, particularly the elderly, who may live alone and view requests for money with great suspicion. Unfortunately, there are many non-members in the business and names cannot be removed from their lists by this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, where they obtained their lists is another issue that causes some debate in this country. List broking is a fast growing business in Australia. However, more often than not, any electronic lists are composed using current or old white pages as a primary source. If an asterisk is placed against particular numbers in this primary source, I envisage that this data could also be transferred to subsequent lists. If a telemarketer observes this code to indicate a subscriber's lack of interest, it is reasonable to assume that they would know that this person is hardly likely to be receptive to their call. I think this is another argument. I mean, we are basically looking for a cheap, efficient and simple way whereby consumers and service providers alike can know what people's preferences are and that they do not wish to be contacted in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But talking about the government's response, in November of last year&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that the report was released the year before last&mdash;Senator Collins, a former communications minister, was asked when a decision would be made on the formal responsibilities of the telecommunications privacy committee and when it would be up and running. The minister's less than positive response was that the government expected to respond to the report in the near future, at which time it would address the question of an appropriate forum for consideration of telecommunications privacy issues. Of course, that is the old `in due course' or `in the fullness of time' argument that we so often hear from Sir Humphrey Appleby in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Prime Minister</EMPHASIS>. It is more than a year down the track and telecommunications privacy is still on the backburner. It indicates that, as with other policy areas, the government's communications policy is a shambles. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very complex issue. As the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said, it is a million dollar industry which is continuing to develop. Questions of privacy, fraud, and abuse come into the paradigm of this particular industry and it is an issue on which the government has still to firm its response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I will address the definitional aspects of it. One thing that is happening in this country, and throughout world, is that, with the increase and development of new technologies, many new forms of selling and marketing are developing. It is putting the world into the situation where it is continually having to face new challenges about the processes and regulations that should be used to ensure that consumer's rights, and the responsibilities of those selling, are put into the proper legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are basically two parts to telemarketing&mdash;inbound and outbound telemarketing. Inbound telemarketing is about consumers calling marketers for product, for information or for purchase. I do not think anyone has a particular problem with that. We are principally talking about outbound telemarketing&mdash;the making of unsolicited telephone calls to consumers by the marketer. Outbound telemarketing could be defined as any deliberate, unsolicited marketing communication activities conducted through telephone lines to the reception facilities&mdash;for example, telephone sets, fax machines, computer modems&mdash;of new customers. As I said, the call is unsolicited and no prior business relationship exists between the telemarketer and the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was said earlier, we have all experienced calls from people whose call we have not asked for regarding particular elements of a sales program or other forms of service delivery. As an issue, when we look at the overseas experience, the potential there is quite frightening. In the United States, telemarketing is a billion dollar business with annual sales amounting to about $430 billion. It is an industry that has had problems in relation to privacy and fraud. Unscrupulous telemarketers can abuse the telephone lines of consumers as much as they like, as long as they pay their telephone bills. The telephone company does not have any liability for the telemarketing behaviour of its customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to fraud, without written records it is easy for telemarketers to manipulate orders. The consumer may also forget the deal that the caller offered. Telemarketers can collect information from consumers over the telephone. If the receiver is a minor or an incautious person he may be deceived into releasing personal information or credit card numbers to professional telephone artists. Telemarketing is a genuine means of communication, but it is very easily misused. Telemarketing fraud has cost the US public about $1 billion a year. The federal trade commission receives over 37,000 complaints about telemarketers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we turn to actually how to legislate and how to regulate this sort of system, we find that a number of approaches have been used in the various states of the United States. Five particular types of telemarketing laws have been used, with varying degrees of success, across the states of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first, I guess, is the asterisk system, the one in respect of which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has moved this motion today, whereby telemarketers cannot call individuals or households who mark in the telephone directory their unwillingness to receive telemarketing calls. There are also automatically dialled recorded message players. Telemarketers are either restricted or not allowed to used automatically dialled recorded message players to make their calls to consumers. The principal aspect of that is that, with the new technology that is developed, it is not normally a situation of just having the phone book there and actually going down the list to make those calls. New technology now allows a greater volume of calls and, therefore, a greater volume of sales, but also at the same time a greater volume of nuisance to the general public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the monitoring of telephone calls. There are regulations governing the recording of conversations during telemarketing calls. They mainly serve to protect the privacy of the telemarketing employee rather than the consumer. In most states where there is such a statute, telemarketers must obtain the prior consent of their employees before they can monitor conversations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also home solicitation regulations. These are rules that apply to telemarketers soliciting business from consumers at home. Telemarketers are required to disclose their identity and to provide a mandatory cooling off period during which buyers may cancel the transaction and secure the return of their down payment. This law is, I think, a very important aspect of what should be done, simply for the reason that, when one receives a telemarketing call, one is not expecting it, is caught off-guard and is often willing to listen. The person who is speaking has a well-rehearsed routine and superior knowledge of the product and of the object of the call. In those situations the consumer can be put at a disadvantage and that can lead to a purchase which, once the purchaser thought about it, he or she would not have actually gone ahead with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other type of law is registration. Before making business solicitation calls, telemarketers have to provide the consumer protection section of the state's department of justice with information on their products and services, employee lists, how they made their calls, price or gift offers, advertising literature and calling scripts. This, I think, is an important part of any system that should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question relating to telemarketing that the honourable member for Moore emphasised was that of privacy&mdash;the fact that people should not be disturbed in their own homes, going about their own lives, by unsolicited telephone calls. I think we understand that that quite clearly is a concern; it is a concern we have all faced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have no figures and no idea of the elements of fraud that exist in the Australian industry, I worry about what has occurred in America and what then may occur in Australia. Something in the region of $3 million to $15 million in tax revenues have been lost, as estimated by the US government, to fraudulent telemarketers. Often telemarketers have a room set up with a bank of phones. The people who are making the calls become expert over time in the detail of what they are required to do. I have also often heard complaints about the working conditions in those situations, about poor wages and about extra pressure being put on employees in a very unfair fashion. It is often part-time work and it is often done on a contract basis in terms of sales. All of that, I think, undermines not only the actual result of those calls, but the actual conditions of the employees doing the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That question of privacy abuse and how we deal with it comes down to two basic approaches that can be used&mdash;that is, more of a remedial approach than preventive measures. By `remedial', I mean action taken subsequent to the actual event. One of the problems with that relates to the nature of many victims of telemarketing fraud. Figures show that they are mostly less educated and younger consumers who are prone to accept the calls and who, subsequent to the event, feel ashamed to report they have been deceived. The problems that can occur in this sort of industry are often ones that will not be reported and, therefore, it is very hard to get a firm handle on the detail of what has occurred. The vulnerability of that group is something that government has to be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the question of preventative measures, the use of asterisks, of course, is one system which could be used. There are a few problems with that. As the technology grows and develops the situation&mdash;and this happens even now&mdash;is that the use of purely the white pages is not necessarily how the future of this industry will go. More and more there are other databases being provided and developed which can be utilised. They can be provided by other industries which have developed their own telemarketing databases. They can also use situations where they are concentrating on an area. They work on the question of the actual prefix by going through, number by number, the actual phone numbers in that area. In those circumstances, that will lead to a position where silent numbers will be rung and any asterisk system would be jeopardised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a difficult area and it is an area that requires a long, hard look from government. I note the Austel report. I urge the government to respond to it as soon as possible. We have got a problem here that we only know a little about as yet, but over time it could be quite damaging. It certainly requires a firm, guided response by the government to ensure that matters like the asterisk system and further regulation are investigated and a proper system of regulation put into place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is quite a self-explanatory motion which the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has moved. It is seeking to protect the privacy of individuals who do not wish to be annoyed by telemarketers selling goods and services. This matter was brought to my attention by a gentleman in my electorate who queried the right of businesses and organisations to make unsolicited telephone calls, often at inconvenient times of the day or night, without the recipient of those calls being able to ensure that such calls are not made to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another occasion, a different constituent received raffle tickets in the mail from a charity. She was told to send $20 despite not having agreed to purchase any raffle tickets. Upon inquiring about this, the lady was told that her house had been telephoned and someone there had agreed to buy the tickets. That was news for the whole household. That perfectly illustrates that unsolicited telephone calls require some regulation and that people require protection and should be afforded privacy from these so-called cold calls if they so desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other areas of communication, we are able to prevent similar nuisances such as junk mail and doorknocking politicians&mdash;or whatever or whomever&mdash;from annoying us with a simple sign on the letterbox or door expressing the wish that we do not want to be annoyed. I am sure honourable members would agree that this method of preventing one from being annoyed is better than having the door slammed in their face. However, there is no way at present of protecting people from being disturbed on the telephone by telemarketers other than if that person has a silent number. This is not a preferable way of going about this, given that to take out a silent number one must pay a fee. What is more, one may also want to appear in the telephone book but just not be disturbed by telemarketers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion seeks to allow people who do not wish to be disturbed by such unsolicited telephone calls perhaps to place an asterisk beside their name in the telephone book. That is one option. Prior to telemarketers making telephone calls on potential clientele, they would have to check the book to ensure that person is prepared to accept such telephone calls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final report in 1992 of Austel's inquiry into the privacy implications of telecommunications services addressed this particular issue. The report recommended that consumers who did not wish to receive unsolicited telephone calls should have a means of exercising that particular preference. In fact, later on in the report it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many submitters&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, to the inquiry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">perceive unsolicited telecommunications as intrusive. They expressed views to the effect that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*such telecommunications should not be permitted unless the called party has given prior explicit consent; and that</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">*there should be a mechanism by which consumers can indicate that they do not wish to receive such calls.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion by the honourable member for Moore provides that mechanism. This would appear to be the easiest and most convenient way of coordinating it, both for telemarketers and the general public alike. The report also, among other things, recommended that a code of conduct be developed by relevant groups dealing with unsolicited telephone calls and that the telecommunications industry ombudsman should be the initial person to whom complaints are referred relating to unsolicited telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These would have to be dealt with if and when the substance of this motion evolves. However, I am also aware that many direct marketing companies conform to a code of conduct, though there are also many, as we have heard, that do not. The Austel report also distinguished between telemarketing&mdash;where unsolicited calls were made in an attempt to sell a good or a service&mdash;and opinion polling,  where it is not intended to sell a good or a service but to seek one's opinion about something. If we adopt a scheme where an asterisk is put next to the names of those who do not want to receive telemarketing calls, it should apply to all unsolicited telephone calls whether they are seeking to sell a good or service or to seek one's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot deny that prior to the last election I undertook telephone surveys to gauge the opinions of people in my electorate, as I am sure many honourable members also did. As a matter of courtesy, we first asked whether they were willing and prepared to participate in a survey, and my helpers also made it known for whom the calls were being made. However, this is not the same as people having a mark put next to their name to ensure they do not receive unsolicited calls. Had we had this scheme in place prior to the last election, I would have respected the desire of those people who wanted their privacy protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While some may disagree with the suggestion that unsolicited telephone calls selling a product are different from those doing opinion polls&mdash;political surveys in particular&mdash;I should point out that we have secret ballots to protect individuals from being identified as supporting a particular political viewpoint. So I ask why individuals cannot be protected from having unknown people seeking similar information, irrespective of whether that polling be about politics or any other subject. I also point out that the fair trading issue has been mentioned as a matter for the states, so accordingly the states' rights should be paramount on that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have concerns about the motion before the House, but not because of its content or intent. In fact, I am very much in favour of a system being put in place whereby the privacy of my constituents can be protected. However, what the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) is doing reminds me of the time when I was a librarian and the association of librarians computerised a subjects heading list according to the technologies of 1922. I suggest that this motion, in asking for an asterisk to be put next to a telephone subscriber's number, is similarly inadequate. Quite honestly, that is like suggesting that we re-invent the ark in this day of modern ships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that people do not sit down with telephone books any more and start dialling by name from the telephone book. It just does not happen that way. I commend the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) for trying to do something in this area but what he is suggesting is nonsense because it will be totally ineffective&mdash;it will do absolutely nothing. With automatic dialling, computer generated numbers do not consult an asterisk. An asterisk in a telephone book is not going to do anything. But if there were a computer register of numbers somewhere within the Telecom system we might get somewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other honourable members have mentioned sequential dialling. The bottom line with sequential dialling is that silent numbers come up, and computer generated calls prove that. There is no-one at the other end to look at the telephone book; it is being done by a computer. I suggest that it creates great problems for the aged and infirm, for working people and people who may be in a romantic situation, to be disturbed by a phone call because someone wants to sell them a shonky wristwatch or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other concern about telemarketing is the use of credit cards and the fraud that has occurred there. I have heard no mention of the style or nature of products that can be sold in this manner. I suggest that there needs to be some rules to govern that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next section is the sale of databases. I am involved in organisations, one of which is a limited liability company, a leagues club which I know has sold the databases of the membership. The membership was not consulted. I suggest that there needs to be rules about selling membership lists of an organisation. Does membership of a club give that club the right to sell your name and address and your privacy to an organisation. A club requires a person to fill out a membership application but does it then have the right to resell that information? I would contend that it does not unless it has your express approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the main areas we should be going into. Unfortunately the motion of the honourable member for Moore does not attempt to do that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unemployment requires new questions and new answers and from the vantage point of the 21st century those nations that have low unemployment levels will be those that have a will to have low levels of unemployment. Unemployment is a global crisis. Employment policies in many countries are in policy gridlock. Chronic and endemic unemployment levels of 10 per cent plus bedevil the developed world. Economic growth by itself will not solve the unemployment problem and there needs to be an examination and a considered analysis of a vast array of alternative strategies. There is no single solution to unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other strategies are being seriously considered. The first European jobs summit in October 1993 canvassed a number of strategies including shifting taxation on employment onto carbon emissions; re-engineering social security and employment benefits; increased public infrastructure spending; encouraging wage restraint to promote lower interest rates; motivating investment in transport and communications; tax incentives to encourage the manufacture and consumption of certain goods; and structural measures to stimulate the labour market and vocational training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those possible strategies there is the enormous potential for job creation in environmental management and technology. There is also no doubt that the exploration of a number of strategies and ideas put forward to reduce working hours and job sharing is timely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patricia Hewitt, the Deputy Director of the Institute of Public Policy Research in London, author of the influential book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time: The Revolution in Work and Family Time</EMPHASIS> and the author of a memorandum to the House of Commons employment committee, presented a widely commented upon paper at the European jobs summit in 1993 in which she argued that a reduction in working time cannot solve the problem of unemployment on its own but that `no analysis of unemployment and employment will be adequate unless it takes account of the rapid changes in the structure of working time and working lifetimes; and no employment debate will be complete if it omits working time re-organisation'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian context, John Moorhouse from the University of South Australia in a submission to the expert committee on employment opportunities preparing the green paper pointed out that according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 20 million hours of overtime are worked in Australia and that since 1978 overtime for males has increased by 70 per cent and for females by over 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simplistically, 20 million hours is equivalent to 500,000 40-hour per week jobs. It is understood that not all of those hours are paid overtime but nevertheless serious consideration could lead to the release of perhaps 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the proposition got short shrift from the expert committee and from the National Institute of Labour Studies through Mark Wooden and Professor Judith Sloane. Mark Wooden said the idea had `simple intuition' and Sloane described it as `an idle notion of work-sharing'. Perhaps in this unemployment debate we need a little more intuition and a little less expert opinion that only seems to want to maintain the status quo. Wooden states that far from creating jobs, restrictions on hours&mdash;and he does not canvass voluntary reduction of hours&mdash;will almost certainly exacerbate the unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he does acknowledge that the trend of average hours worked by full-time employees has been moving upward. He also acknowledges the marked increase in full-time employees working very long hours. He states that the proportion of full-time workers working in excess of 40 hours has grown from 30 per cent of all persons working full-time to over 40 per cent, and that 20 per cent of workers now work more than 49 hours per week. He contends that this may be because of multiple job holding representing 4.3 per cent of the work force. That must be about 150,000 persons. Wooden also states that 16.5 per cent of workers work paid overtime. That is 3.8 million paid hours worked by full-time employees. Redistributed, that is almost 100,000 jobs. Probably the truth is that the potential number of jobs from the redistribution of overtime could be as low as 100,000 and up to a theoretical maximum of 500,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his conclusion Wooden states that many Australian workers are working longer hours than ever before and thus it is reasonable to question whether a more equitable redistribution of working hours could not be achieved. He goes on to say that restriction of hours&mdash;he does not canvass voluntary reduction&mdash;would cause unemployment to rise and output to fall due to the greater inefficiency of unemployed labour. Sloane also argues that job-sharing is unlikely to be welcomed by employers and will be very unpopular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially the criticisms of Wooden and Sloane are purely economic. They take little or no account of social costs of unemployment, with increased crime and suicide, nor do they mention an inefficient economy with high unemployment levels, occupational health and safety, lost productivity caused by fatigue and boredom, increased compensation claims and redundancy payouts. Despite some experts' comments that reducing working hours and job-sharing are naive, they are in fact happening in Australia and elsewhere. The Commonwealth Bank introduced a job-sharing scheme three years ago and now has more than 900 employees in that scheme. Phillip Levy, the Commonwealth's general manager of personnel, rejected the claims by some academics and employers that job-sharing is complicated and expensive. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Job-sharing in our bank is basically self-administering.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Peter Botsman, the executive director of the Evatt Foundation, in his report on the European job summit cited the examples provided by Patricia Hewitt which `exemplified the problems and possibilities of work sharing and reduced working hours'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January 1993, a British retail company by the name of Burtons made 1,000 workers redundant and then invited them back again to apply for 3,000 lower paid part-time contract jobs. That confrontational approach used by the company caused, not surprisingly, huge problems. By contrast, just a few months later British Airways sought to reduce its work force by allowing its employees in a variety of different areas to reduce their working hours while retaining their pay rates, pension scheme membership and other job terms and conditions. The British Airways road, Hewitt contends, was the high road to flexibility to meet its labour force reductions and to make redundancy savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Botsman and Hewitt acknowledge the criticism of some economists that proposals for reducing working hours suffer from a `lump of output' fallacy: that is, the total amount of work to be done is fixed and therefore the only way to employ more people is to share the work more frequently. Hewitt argues that there is a demand deficit which must be addressed through increased expenditure on public infrastructure and higher standards of care and education. Hewitt also added new evidence to support her case. She argues that the `lump of output' fallacy is indeed fallacious because of the productivity gains throughout the 20th century. Between 1881 and 1981, the lifetime hours worked by British men fell from 154,000 hours over 56 years to 88,000 hours over 48 years. Hewitt also cited studies by the French economist Michel Albert which showed that the high productivity gains in the last decade had turned the economy into a machine for unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Germany, the most revolutionary moves have been made to reduce working hours through an accord between employers and unions. The shorter working week has increased the number of mainly full-time jobs by between 250,000 and 300,000. The Volkswagen accord is worthy of comment. After marathon bargaining sessions, workers at Volkswagen plants in Germany will put in 20 per cent fewer hours but will get only a 10 per cent wage cut. The accord took effect on 1 January this year and it cuts the working week from 36 hours to 28.8 hours. Volkswagen management has said it will save 1.8 billion German marks a year, or about 20 per cent of its wage costs, and it was the only alternative to cutting 30,000 of its 100,000 jobs in the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schemes for job-sharing and reducing working hours will not on their own solve the unemployment problem. We realise that. However, these schemes can make a significant difference. They must be analysed and seriously considered in the unemployment debate, along with other innovative strategies. Implementing such schemes is not without problems but voluntary reductions or negotiated agreements between employers and unions and workers do work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some economists, particularly people such as Judith Sloane and Mark Wooden, who criticise the potential of such schemes, seem to ignore that it is happening. It is happening in this country; it is happening overseas. Perhaps, when the debate comes to job-sharing and reducing working hours, those economists ought to be reminded of the words of Victor Hugo:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An invasion of armies can be resisted but not an idea whose day has come.</PARA>
<PARA>The day has come for this country to seriously consider the alternative strategies of job-sharing and reducing working hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my contribution to this motion on solutions for unemployment, I wish to address the first two sections of the motion put by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). The first of those is that we need innovative solutions to reduce unemployment in Australia. Hear, hear! We certainly do. The most innovative solution that I can think of is to replace the absolutely inefficient, incoherent and untenable Labor government which attempts to run this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990, as the then Treasurer of Australia, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has the honour of leading this country, visited my electorate to open a new production facility at Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd, arguably Australia's second largest pharmaceutical manufacturer. That company is growing rapidly in terms of output, export and number of employees. It is an exemplary firm. The then Treasurer gave a speech in a marquee at Glaxo and, in that statement about very high interest rates, he said that we just did not understand. We understood all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who understand business and industry knew that unemployment was going to go through the roof. Companies were falling over left, right and centre. Small- and medium-sized businesses were keeling over at unprecedented rates. Why? It is because no-one can support paying 23, 24 or 25 per cent interest on outstanding debt. Companies that were highly geared and structured from the very rapid increase in output throughout the 1980s felt that very strongly. So as an innovative solution, let us get rid of this government that never has and never will understand Australian business, industry or commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing which we could do to decrease unemployment is to change the culture of the Australian Public Service. Yesterday I visited Telecom Australia, which has a purchasing policy that, in the first instance, it should try to buy Australian goods, products and services, particularly in the major project market as it develops new systems, new exchanges, new interchanges, and so forth. That policy has been highly successful. Telecom Australia manages to achieve in the order of 70 per cent Australian content. That is positive for Australia. It means jobs for Australians. It also feeds on itself because new industry develops from new technology, which leads to new businesses, more employment and new export potential for our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the ethos in the Australian public sector? It is to buy somebody else's goods and somebody else's services from somebody else's country. Its ethos is that Australian quality must be second class. We must change the culture of the Australian public sector. That would be a very positive initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should scrap the training guarantee levy. Time and time again in this place I have explained to this House the negative factors which the training guarantee levy induces in the job market, and yet this government continues to prevaricate while we have one more inquiry into the training guarantee levy. Even the government's regional development committee suggests that we should suspend it. Let us not just suspend it; let us suspend it indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to reduce the level of redundancy payments in order to shift social welfare payments into the public sector where they belong and out of the private sector job market cost scenario. Why is that important? It is important because it creates a mindset in the private sector market. The mindset says, `If I get hit like I did in 1989 or 1990 or 1991 with having a massive downturn in my business and having no option but to reduce my work force, I know that those very high redundancy payments in many cases sent many companies over the wall and into voluntary liquidation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other cases, employers are determined that they will never hire full-time employees again so long as they can hire part-time and casual employees, and those classifications of workers are increasing rapidly. Very high redundancy payments as part of the industrial relation system are a positive deterrent to full-time employment. We really need to actually, rather than theoretically, deregulate the labour market. That has been said over and over again, and those on the other side know it to be true, as do I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to put some real teeth into micro-economic reform&mdash;not just talk about it. We need to reduce government taxes on business inputs, not increase them&mdash;for example, fuel excise. We are increasing fuel excise, thereby increasing company transport costs. We are increasing the cost of diesel oil to fire the generators for Nabalco at Gove in the Northern Territory, which makes a total nonsense of the $10 million that that company has just spent to reduce pollution and increase efficiency in its powerhouse. And what happens? The increase in the levy, the increase in taxation on diesel fuel oil, totally offsets the $10 million that Nabalco was just going to save in terms of increased efficiency. This government, while it talks about micro-economic reform, actually produces very little. There is a long range of other things which I could mention but I will run out of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the honourable member's motion says, in particular, `we acknowledge the export potential of environmental industries'. In this case I will support the honourable member for Port Adelaide very strongly, and I have been a strong supporter, in a national sense, of developing fully a renewable resource energy potential in this country. That is available to us in a number of respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one issue which I have attempted to bring to national attention is the huge tidal range that exists in the Kimberleys on the coast of Western Australia at a number of inlets and bays where we could build barricades and where we could install turbogenerators so that we generate electric power from the rise and fall of the tides. If the tides ever fail us, I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that we are gone. There is an energy source which is non-destructible, absolutely renewable and, in a sense, is totally free. The electricity, the power, that we generate from those turbos would cost us only the cost of capital development and some small operating expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need a bit of vision and a bit of political will in order to undertake this kind of an enterprise. It is a long way from the rest of Australia. It is a long way from those centres that use electric power. But there is a solution to that problem. That solution is a thing called hydrogen. At the moment the major energy carrier, outside of copper wire for electric current, is hydrocarbons, in terms of fuel oil, diesel oil and gas in various forms. But hydrocarbons, in terms of their quantity available to us, are a limited resource. We can use those hydrocarbons to produce chemicals, to produce all sorts and manner of things that mankind needs in order to make his lifestyle better. But what do we do? We burn them. We put more carbon into the atmosphere. We choke our lungs and our cities and we think we are doing the world a favour. We are not. But there is a solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution is to take the electric power that we could generate in the Kimberley from the rise and fall of the tides and, through electrolysis, to split water into its basic elements, hydrogen and oxygen, and convert it. If we put the hydrogen in pipelines and pump that across the nation, we can burn the hydrogen in low-temperature burners and the only pollutant, the only waste product, is water. The hydrogen recombines with oxygen to form water. So we have, as an energy carrier, hydrogen which we can use in power stations and in fuel cells, which we can use in our automobiles and trucks. The engineers around the world who look into energy transmission estimate that clearly by the middle of next century hydrogen will start to become the world's major energy carrier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an opportunity in Australia to be the first. We can show the way. We can start new technology which will feed on itself, which will provide more jobs and which will give us new industries. New ideas would flow out of the technical work, the research work, the scientific work, which we undertake on this massive infrastructure project.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), one of the workhorses of the B team. Up until halfway through his speech, I thought we were hearing the recycled speech he usually gives, but here indeed was a positive, innovative idea. For that I congratulate him. It is encouraging to see this because normally the only focus and commitment of the opposition in terms of jobs is on who is going to get the top job and who is going to get on to the front bench. While the parliamentary Australian Labor Party in its caucus meetings is busy making constructive suggestions to contribute to new ideas on employment generation, the Liberal Party is embroiled in its leadership dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is very important to note that, in the matter of public importance on unemployment that the opposition brought on last week, a lot of statistics which are widely known and accepted by the government were raised by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) but very little policy innovation. That goes to the heart of the problem of my colleagues on the other side. I encourage them to join with us in looking for constructive solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said in response to the MPI on unemployment, that we be reminded that since 1983 there has been a 25 per cent increase in jobs. In fact, 1.6 million jobs have been created. At the same time, we have seen a growth in unemployment of 230,000. This is a major difficulty that has to be faced, given structural changes to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, one of the problems has been the increase in the participation rate. I refer to an article by Michael Munford in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 17 January 1994 in which he looks at these trends, not only in Australia but in the OECD. In fact, he mentions that the OECD figures are fairly typical of the Australian figures in terms of the proportion of people coming into the work force. From 1966 we had 42.8 per cent of the population working or seeking work, as opposed to 41 per cent actually working. That had risen in 1989 to 47 per cent actually seeking work, with only 44 per cent working. The important issue of which we have to remind ourselves is stated in his article. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All these countries have seen higher unemployment levels in the 70s than in the 60s, higher in the 80s than in the 70s. In all these countries there have also been shorter-term trends, with a decline in unemployment in the late 80s, followed by a steep rise in the early 90s.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is measured as the percentage of the "labour force" which is unemployed. The "labour force" means all those who have work or seek work. So if more people seek work, unemployment will rise, and it will be difficult to get a job, even if there are just as many jobs available. This on the whole is what has happened in Western countries over the past two decades.</PARA>
<PARA>This has affected the Australian situation. Obviously, there have been many factors, but one of the factors Munford reminds us about concerns demographic changes in the population distribution. In fact, we now have a higher proportion of people of work force age and a declining birth rate. So we have got a bulge in the potential work force available and an increase in numbers in those people actively seeking work which, of course, includes women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said, in a number of areas of the community, that if women went back into the kitchen we would not have this problem. But women voted with their feet; they want to work; they want to participate equally; and they have been a success story in terms of increased participation. What we now have to do, across all sectors, is to deal with the mismatch in the skills base, as was mentioned by the minister in his response on the matter of public importance. What we also need to look at is the fact that there has been an improvement in the overall economic picture. I want to cite Terry McCrann in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> on 18 January. He reminded his readers that he had predicted the recession of 1990 but he now says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the opportunity to build prosperity far more real, far more sustainable and much more solidly based than the speculative and entrepreneur-blown boom of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>He further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have already added more than 100,000 jobs and the number could approach 200,000 by the end of the financial year and growth overall in the economy should push 4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>This is, of course, a result of government policy. He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For us, we get a supercharger as the rhetoric of the past decade about hitching a ride on Asia's boom increasingly becomes fact. And we will be able to do so precisely because we have become far leaner and more competitive over the past five years&mdash;partly through belt-tightening the recession, partly through real structural change.</PARA>
<PARA>It is nice to know that Terry McCrann is supportive of what the government has achieved in that time. I now wish to address my remarks to the innovative solutions. Obviously, the green paper on employment and the government's upcoming policy statements want to address these very significant difficulties, particularly with the long-term unemployed. That is where we have a real difficulty. As the economy picks up, the people most likely to get into the work force are going to be those people with skills and flexibility. But we have obviously realised, in the course of this past 10 years, that those workers who have been displaced by structural change and  young people without adequate skill based training are going to be the people hardest to place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to government, industry and communities to work together. I want to give some examples from my electorate of just how communities can drive innovative solutions. The first one is the most successful $1 million worth of work campaign launched, just three weeks ago, by the local community of Rockhampton. This was driven by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, local media outlets, the Rockhampton <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Morning Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and radio station 4R0. They launched a campaign to get $1 million worth of work generated in a 10-week period. What we asked employers to do was to get behind the issue and see the importance of looking to invest in new personnel. The results have been extraordinary. On the first day, $270,572 worth of work was pledged. By the end of the first week, over $500,000 worth of work had been pledged. The target of $1 million worth of work was reached in just three weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came about because of a number of factors and not just because of the media campaign: there has been an upturn in the positive psychology of the country based on the realistic statistics that have been coming out. People and employers are now seeing that the recovery is happening. Their goods are required; their services are required; so it is now time to put on staff. This innovation shows that if there are governments, communities and people working together and investing in people&mdash;that was the point my colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) was referring to&mdash;then we start to get a pick-up in employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative that I would like to tell honourable members about is the Capricornia Training Co. This is an example, once again, of a state government, DEET and the community working together with the training sector. The particular example that I would like to mention is that of the state government investing $1.2 million in the building of housing commission homes in the Rockhampton region. This has been used to provide employment for young apprentices who are doing carpentry and building trades training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These young people work on site and build the houses.

It has been supported by DEET. </PARA>

In country areas the unemployment levels are much higher&mdash;upwards of 18 per cent&mdash;and there is also hidden unemployment. Finally, the government has come forward with a motion to deal with what I regard as fundamental issues which could have been addressed during the 11 years of its government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the report which has been quoted in the honourable member's motion. It was put together by the ACTU and the Australian Conservation Foundation. In the report, they recognise a number of very serious issues where environmental jobs can be created. I do not think there is anything new or innovative about the issues. They refer to pollution abatement with respect to air, water and soils. I want to concentrate on the water aspect of it; that was in point No. 1. Point No. 5 of this report is about water and sewage treatment works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are issues that are not only absolutely fundamental to the good health of the community but they also create employment opportunities.

In fact, it was highlighted in my local area with the outbreak of further toxic growths in water catchment areas. The season for blue-green algae growth is with us right now and this problem has repeated itself over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, only about 12 months ago, we had an outbreak of blue-green algae in many of the waterways and tributaries leading into that magnificent river system, the Murray-Darling Basin. I am sure that the honourable member for Port Adelaide would understand that water and its quality are vital to the state that he represents. Although the upper reaches and tributaries of the Murray-Darling system are not in South Australia, he would be the first, I am sure, to acknowledge that the quality of the water supply in the state of South Australia is less than desirable. In fact, in many areas, it does not meet world health standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue particularly because toxic growth shock was reported on Wednesday, 9 February in a number of recreation lakes and holding areas around the electorate of Bendigo which had been affected by this blue-green algal growth. It was not only in recreational areas such as Lake Neangar, Lake Tom Thumb, Lake Weeroona and other small areas, but also in Cairn Curran reservoir, which supplies drinking water to a number of areas. In fact, that water has been revealed to be unfit for drinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a massive indictment of the present government for not putting money and effort into carrying out the research on the prevalence of toxic growth in waterways and tributaries throughout Australia, and for not dealing with that problem. It requires additional money to be put in by the government into researching that problem throughout Australia. In fact, the whole catchment area of the Murray-Darling Basin needs to have the question of blue-green algal growth addressed. It is of vital importance, and is also linked with water treatment and sewage treatment plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, under both former Prime Minister Hawke and the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), has neglected to provide water and sewage treatment works to many rural township areas in Australia. Ultimately, the outflow or effluent from those systems finds its way into many tributaries which eventually lead into the Murray-Darling system and pollute that watercourse. As I mentioned, it also flows into the Adelaide area and can of course be detrimental to the large population of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) has brought this motion forward because of his concern for this area. I have spoken with him on occasions about aspects of environmental issues, and I know he has a deep interest in this. He needs to reflect on it and take the message back to his party in their caucus room and tell them of the years of neglect and lack of funding for research into this major problem&mdash;and into the matter of obtaining water treatment for small rural areas and country towns&mdash;and of the need for an influx of money to be spent on sewage plants that have been neglected by the federal government for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of concern to me and to all country residents. As I indicated to you, the work that is involved and the employment opportunities in that area are nothing new. They may not be terribly innovative, but they do not have to be the latest buzz word. All that the people in those areas require is a good clean water supply; attention to the catchment areas to ensure that those areas are in fact safeguarded against the inflow of chemicals or other external matter that might pollute the water supply; greater care and attention to water catchments; and greater involvement of federal government money in improving the water supply system and sewage treatment plants of many country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small township of Elmore, in the northern part of my electorate, is situated right alongside the Campaspe River, which ultimately feeds into the Murray River. It is presently facing the problem of water pollution. Both the state and federal governments are putting a proposal to the people of that community to have a sewage system and water treatment works implemented. I trust that the residents of that area will agree to that scheme, because any effluent which has previously been discharged from water and sewage treatment plants has been flowing into the Campaspe River and ultimately into the Murray-Darling system, which dumps it in Adelaide. That must cease, and the government must address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are opportunities for employment there and, with the application of additional money to research, particularly to this toxic growth problem with blue-green algae, we must address that question; we must ensure that the quality of water throughout Australia meets the standards of the World Health Organisation. It is one of the most fundamental and basic things required in Australia and it must be addressed by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the honourable member for Port Adelaide for moving his motion and giving us the opportunity to put forward these views. I ask that the honourable member for Port Adelaide impress this matter upon his party, the party of government at the moment, which has neglected these issues. I certainly will raise this matter with my own party, and let us hope that we can approach this in a bipartisan manner so that this problem in our water system is overcome. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story goes that, during the late 1950s when Russia was still in charge of Austria, the leaders of the country were locked up together&mdash;industrialists, unionists and politicians&mdash;and realised what was going to happen after the postwar period. They realised that there was a need to be more competitive if they were to match the resurgence of Germany, so they formed a social accord while they were in prison. They decided that with this policy they would specialise in exceptionally high standards. The social accord they would be lifting the skills of their country; they would concentrate on the best products and the best opportunities. Austria has been very successful in taking this into account, and I think Australia could learn a lot from this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface today's grievance debate by quoting from the foreword to the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Where Fate Calls</EMPHASIS> written by Dr Tom Frame in 1992. It says in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the night of 10 February 1964, during naval exercises off the south coast of New South Wales, the destroyer HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> inexplicably crossed the bows of the aircraft carrier HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne</EMPHASIS> and was sliced in two. Within a matter of minutes, 82 men perished, making the collision Australia's worst peacetime disaster.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an unprecedented action, the Australian government broke with established practices and ordered a royal commission into the tragedy. Its findings were controversial and public and parliamentary concern resulted in the appointment of a second commission, again an unprecedented action. Its findings were released four years after the event and the commission has been described as the most spiteful and vindictive in Australia's legal history.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Where Fate Calls' is a probing and controversial investigation of the four-year <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> saga and its aftermath, the first fully researched account of one of the most important events in Australia's national history&mdash;a veteran Canberra political commentator said recently, "The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> story must rate as one of Canberra's three biggest, along with the Petrov defection and the dismissal of the Whitlam Government".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an enthralling story containing all of the elements of an epic thriller: a dramatic naval disaster at night, tragic loss of life, exploits of extraordinary bravery, court-room action, political intrigue, public outrage and claims of cover-ups and conspiracies.</PARA>
<PARA>It was, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said on 6 April 1989:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The longest and sorriest story in our naval&mdash;perhaps our parliamentary&mdash;history. It is a sad record of evasion, dishonesty and incompetence. Ministers have prevaricated, royal commissions have blundered, naval officers have concealed the truth. Evidence has been destroyed and mislaid.</PARA>
<PARA>Today is the 30th anniversary of that national tragedy. As a young duty officer in Canberra that night, and as someone who knew many of those who died or who survived, it remains indelibly etched on my memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I entered this parliament in 1988 I have been heavily involved in compensation cases for survivors of that tragedy, including a precedent-setting High Court action for one of them in 1990, the so-called Verwayen case. Although that claim and some others now have been settled, regrettably many other survivors and their families still bear the indelible scars of psychological trauma, persistent nervous shock, domestic instability, financial strain and, very importantly in this parliamentary setting, misplaced confidence in a government which espouses social justice but which until last year failed to put its money where its mouth is and live up to its compassionate rhetoric. The Brisbane <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> said, in part, in September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The view that the Commonwealth has behaved with despicable bureaucratic self-interest in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> case would result in very little argument in the general community. The High Court ruling paving the way for compensation claims by the survivors of that horrific 1964 naval accident, is a signal victory for social justice. . . the Commonwealth long denied liability for compensation. Mr Hawke's first government lifted the statute of limitations on the case in 1985, then slammed the door in 1986 when it found there might be substantial compensation claims in the offing.</PARA>
<PARA>The Verwayen judgment meant that the Commonwealth, as an employer of people paid to defend the country, cannot claim exemption from civil compensation if those people come to harm in the course of their natural or normal duties&mdash;the so-called combat defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1986, ministers have relied on legalistic jingoism in each individual case. Squirm as they might about their rationale, ministers knew that the bottom line for the Commonwealth was a total compensation bill of $30 million to $40 million. Unnecessary and costly legal argument was therefore used as a battering ram to cloud the real issue of this government's reluctance to satisfy such an embarrassingly substantial budgetary outlay. In 1992, Mr Justice Coldrey said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would, of course, have been open to the defendant&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in this case the Commonwealth&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if it lost the Verwayen case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which indeed it did&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to withdraw its defences against all remaining <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claimants on the basis of consistency towards an otherwise homogeneous class of persons and in order to prevent any perception of discrimination and injustice.</PARA>
<PARA>Early in 1993 the full court of the Victorian Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by the Commonwealth against another of the damages claims, with Mr Justice Ormiston affirming that the Commonwealth could not rely on either the combat defence or the statute of limitations. On 13 May last year we saw a tardy but nonetheless historic turning point from the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) when he told the House, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was asked by the honourable member for Groom about the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases. At that time I indicated that negotiations were going on with a view to the Commonwealth and the solicitors for the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claimants coming to a resolution of the matter by today where the matters would be mentioned again before the Victorian Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to tell the honourable member that in relation to his constituent, Mr Clark, the Commonwealth has told the Supreme Court that we will not be seeking special leave to appeal. Mr Clark will be paid in accordance with earlier court decisions. In relation to other HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims, there are some 19 which the Commonwealth now regards as having been effectively decided by the decision in Clark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clark decision was on the question of estoppel on a particular date where the Commonwealth changed tack in terms of defending these actions. All cases that commenced prior to February 1986 will be regarded as settled. The Commonwealth will immediately enter into negotiations in relation to these claims with a view to settling them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims which the Commonwealth does not consider resolved by the decision in Clark, the Commonwealth will not admit liability. However, in accordance with instructions from the Attorney-General and following discussions of the Cabinet, the Commonwealth government solicitors will enter into negotiations with the rest of the claimants with a view to reaching a settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those negotiations do not succeed, the next step will be a process of mediation. We are hopeful, and I think this is a hope shared by the solicitors for the claimants, that that process should see the remaining cases settled . . . </PARA>
<PARA>His speech concluded with these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been a long and difficult case but I do believe that now we are at the stage where the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> claims can be reasonably settled to the satisfaction of both sides.</PARA>
<PARA>I take the opportunity again today to commend the Attorney-General for taking this course of action so early in his portfolio responsibility, albeit after seven years of unnecessary Commonwealth confrontation from the Hawke and Keating governments. I also thank Victorian solicitor Jim Taylor and other legal counsel, without whose persistence and strong sense of equity the claims would still be sitting on very barren ground. The settlement of claims by 89 of the survivors announced in the Victorian Supreme Court on 23 December last year is welcomed. About 25 claims lodged recently remain outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding that new legal ground has been broken by the present Attorney-General, the fact that it took 30 years to do so stands as an indefensible indictment of the undue bureaucracy and legal obstructionism by this government, as well as a lack of political will on both sides of the political fence over that long period. That said, I hope that we now have a situation where those who perished in 1964 might rest easier and many of those who survived may be able to pick up the remnants of their shattered lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that 1994 will see the closing chapter of a long, destructive and divisive struggle. Tom Frame's book should be a salutary reminder to many: to the people of Australia, to the Royal Australian Navy and to federal governments of all party political hues. No-one wants a witch hunt after 30 years, but deep doubt and an inherent mistrust persist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, service at sea is a dangerous calling and every now and again fate extracts a penalty. It would appear that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS>'s motto was appropriate. She went `where fate calls'.

May <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS>'s commanding officer, Captain Stevens, and his shipmates rest in peace on this historic day. </PARA>

Had the coalition won the last federal election, the Fightback policy of zero tariffs would have decimated the motor vehicle and textile clothing and footwear industries.

The President of the Liberal Party, Mr Tony Staley, has also expressed his concerns about the opposition's former industry policy. Mr Staley recently told the Young Liberals that Fightback `misunderstood the motor vehicle and communications industries and relied too heavily on the economic rationalist doctrine of government non-intervention'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During a television program on Sunday 6 February 1994, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) announced that he was unilaterally dumping the party's zero tariff policy.

<PARA>Within weeks the Leader of the Opposition, who claims to stand for trust and honesty, broke his promise to his colleagues to consult with them on major policy changes. Why has the Leader of the Opposition forsaken the trust of his colleagues? Why has he shunted his colleague Senator Robert Hill out of the shadow ministry for the empty chalice of chairman of his party's policy development committee? Prominent journalist Geoff Kitney suggests that these actions are a result of the de-stabilisation of the Liberal Party leadership. </PARA>

In his media release of 7 February 1994, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the shadow minister for science, technology and export development, called for a clear and comprehensive export development strategy in the forthcoming industry statement. Does the honourable member for Goldstein support the government's programs to help small and medium sized export businesses? The government already has an export development strategy.

We acknowledge that a competitive industry environment is essential for the foundation of industry policy through the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recognise that industry policy is evolving and that we will soon enter a new phase in the development of our industry base. The first phase of reform of Australia's industry structure saw industry gradually exposed to international market forces through controlled reduction in tariff levels. This first phase of industry restructure was not just about tariff levels being reduced. The government took on a commitment to micro-economic reform because internationally competitive companies need an internationally competitive infrastructure. The industry policies introduced by the government in the 1980s and the early 1990s have seen the development of a more outward looking and dynamic industry sector. But the job is not yet complete. A second phase in the reform of Australia's industry structure will maintain and extend the move to internationalise the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is committed to the reform processes it has initiated since coming to power. We are committed to creating a dynamic and innovative industrial base. In our industry statement we will recognise the role of government in industry development and we will seek to provide policy and institutional stability. We will seek to develop a strong and cooperative relationship between government and industry so that industry concerns can be addressed and new opportunities identified and met. More importantly, we are committed to developing a more dynamic business environment. We believe the move to a post-tariff environment is the first wave of industry reform and that the second wave is to hasten the agenda to create a more competitive business environment. </PARA>

During the last 10 years in the industry there have been difficulties in the availability of airfreight space during the peak crayfish season. The cray industry has, I suppose, in the normal operation of its business, standard contracts with freighters and, therefore, a regular supply of product that drives up export prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airlines, in defending their lack of available airfreight space for export vegetables and fruit, have said that air passenger volume out of Perth has increased greatly in the last couple of years and that airfreight capacity has not kept pace. A study on perishable export airfreight is being undertaken for the state government at the present time and a report is due to be released very shortly. I am pleased to see that the inquiry is taking place because my constituents are very concerned about being unable to get space to develop this very fast growing niche export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years there has been a growth in exports of market garden produce of 25 per cent but an air space capacity increase of less than 10 per cent. The producers determine their exports according to product yield and airfreight capacity, which in turn relates to the volume of passenger traffic and other freight. Because the airlines are saying that they can carry only so many tonnes, producers opt to export the products giving them the best yield&mdash;lobsters or crayfish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crayfish industry is a very large source of export revenue for Australia while the lobster industry, producing 10 million to 12 million tonnes per annum, is a growing and highly managed industry. In the past, lobsters were mostly sold frozen but the industry has now started to sell lobster as live product. Last year about 2,300 kilos, which represents 19 per cent of the total catch, were shipped live. Over the next few years the intention and hope of the industry is to convert this to 80 per cent of total catch. This in itself will cause a problem which will also affect the lobster industry. Most of the export goes to Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. This does not create a problem when the industry can airfreight direct. However, when this is not possible, the freight goes via indirect routes&mdash;for example, through Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us from this side organised a meeting of key players in the industry in my electorate, as well invited an adviser from the office of the state Minister for Finance, representatives from the department of transport and aviation, and one of the consultants who is preparing the report. The purpose of the meeting held on 23 December was to look at the means available to remedy the recurring problem with airfreight availability. We had a very constructive discussion. Background was given to the current problems within the local export industry. Concern was registered at the prospects for a major export industry in the Ord River to service Asian markets that would be likely to be affected by the lack of airfreight capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that there is a large meeting being organised in the area during the early part of this year so that the local growers and exporters can express their concern to the consultants who have been undertaking a review of this area on behalf of the state minister for finance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example which was raised by one of my constituents who is a grower. He cited the case of a contract he has with Malaysia where he has an order for 2,000 cartons of produce but, because of airfreight inability, he can only supply half this quantity. He went on to explain that a problem for a large number of growers came about, as I mentioned earlier, when the crayfishing season started and they were able to pay higher freight rates&mdash;$3 per kilo&mdash;because of the obvious high selling cost of their product overseas. Because of these higher rates, the vegetable growers were often left without any airfreight capacity to shift their products overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was agreed at the meeting that airfreight capability or capacity was the key element and this can be lost if someone else is willing to pay more dollars. The problem is, of course, that in trying to manage the export of vegetables grown in the area often the exporters or the growers are faced with the problem of getting airspace available to them at the last possible minute. Of course, that means they have to take advantage or they lose business and that makes for an obvious problem in organising or managing their vital industry. It was also stated at the meeting that there were limited chill facilities at Perth airport and they needed to be booked in advance if required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal markets for my constituents' products are South-East Asia, Malaysia, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, with secondary markets in Penang, Thailand, Hong Kong and Indonesia. As I mentioned, the problems occurred when cray marketing commenced. While exports were principally to Japan and Taiwan, a lot of the goods were airfreighted via Singapore and other Asian cities because of the limited air capacity direct to Tokyo. Of course, that mitigates the opportunity for my constituents to get airfreight space out of Perth to their South-East Asian marketplaces. It was also stated that freight out of Melbourne is cheaper than out of Perth. It was agreed that there was a need for a regular supply of airfreight capacity so that regular markets could be set up. This would go a long way towards gaining an increased percentage of the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Boeing 747 aircraft can hold about 100 tonnes of freight. The observation was made whether the overseas markets could handle this amount of produce in such bulk. It was thought that an individual market would not be able to cope with this. It was suggested that, if an airfreight supply could be established, the group should look at using this to export products to three or more markets at a time. It was also suggested that the group try to organise seed money to underwrite a freight-only aircraft to do the run to the Asian markets. David Jull, the shadow minister for aviation who was present at that meeting and who had a very strong participation in it, mentioned that the Russians have excess aircraft which they are willing to put into other markets. There was some concern the markets would not be able to accommodate the 100 tonnes of fresh vegetables arriving at the same time. If the idea for airfreight under those circumstances got off the ground, the cargo would have to be mixed in order for the venture to succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the dying moments of my speech, I would like to say that our market gardening industry in Wanneroo in my electorate is a very important one. It has a very important developing niche market in South-East Asia, but unfortunately it has been thwarted by a lack of available airfreight space between Perth and the South-East Asian target markets. This is something that is obviously of great concern. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in this grievance debate to express to the parliament my concern at a recent article that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 3 February, in which unsubstantiated claims by the Executive Director of Athletics Australia were made. He stated in that article that he was very unhappy with the lack of communication, trust and cooperation between the Australian Sports Drug Agency and Athletics Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that these claims made by Athletics Australia are, at best, not an accurate reflection of working relationships between our agency and Athletics Australia and in some cases are completely wrong. In 1992-93, ASDA conducted a total of 336 event and out-of-competition tests on Athletics Australia athletes. This represents almost 16 per cent of the government funded tests that ASDA conducted in that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To successfully conduct a testing program of this magnitude it is clearly essential that there has to be cooperation between both organisations. This is to ensure that ASDA has the information about athletes and events so that it can conduct sample collections in a manner which is secure and respects the rights and the privacies of our athletes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, from time to time, issues of concern are raised in this contentious area of drugs in sport. There have been times when Athletics Australia has raised concerns with ASDA about procedural matters associated with the collection of samples for testing, and certainly about the notification of those results. I am well aware that in 1990, for instance, Athletics Australia identified approximately 20 issues which it wanted to discuss with ASDA with a view to achieving consistency between the sample collection and the testing procedures. To date, because of that close cooperation, all but two of those issues have been resolved to the satisfaction of both organisations and I am proud to say negotiations continue on those other two matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Sports Drug Agency was established by our government as a statutory authority in 1991 with bipartisan political support. Since that time it has established itself as world leader in the fight against drugs in sport. Professor Don Catlin, who successfully coordinated the drug testing program for the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles recently sent the following message to our chief executive at ASDA after the successful bid of Sydney to host the 2000 games. I would like to quote part of that message to our chief executive officer. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am thoroughly delighted to learn that your fine nation will host the games of 2000. Having experienced the thrill and excitement of being personally involved in '84 I can attest to a wonderful experience coming your way. It will be a marvellous experience. Hurrah for Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the important paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am equally excited because your agency and lab will be able to play a major role in developments during this critical phase. I can't imagine a better person to shoulder that responsibility than you, and wish you wisdom and determination as you traverse the terrain.</PARA>
<PARA>High praise indeed. It is in such high esteem that our Australian Sports Drug Agency is held by all international sporting bodies. I would add that the Australian Sports Drug Agency has an excellent relationship with Athletics Australia's international body, the International Amateur Athletics Federation. ASDA has already conducted drug tests on behalf of the International Amateur Athletics Foundation in the Oceania region. A contract between ASDA and the International Athletics Federation is currently being negotiated and should be formalised, we hope, during 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that ASDA continues to work with international sporting organisations. It is important because we need to establish drug testing programs, particularly in South-East Asia. We need to test the contestants in all world championships held in Australia. Last year the agency was the first independent organisation to be used by the International Weightlifting Federation to conduct drug tests at its world championships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, our ASDA officers conducted drug testing in China and South Korea on behalf of the International Rowing Federation. This again was a world first. As part of the drive to ensure that there is a level playing field in international competition, two matters are currently under consideration by our government. One is the signing of the anti-doping convention of the Council of Europe, with all of the associated rights of membership that go with this, and the other is the development of links with China and ASDA where we are encouraging an exchange of ideas and programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I am sure all honourable members will agree, sport is about dedication, hard work and the pursuit of excellence. It is a test of an athlete's natural abilities, not those of the chemist. The annual report of the Australian Sports Drug Agency for 1992-93, which was tabled in this parliament on 3 February, shows that nearly 3,000 drug tests were conducted in that period. Of those tests, 2,000 were conducted on athletes involved in our major Olympic and Commonwealth Games sports, including cycling, weight-lifting, swimming and athletics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional tests for professional sports, such as the New South Wales Rugby League, the national soccer league, and the Australian Football League, were conducted on behalf of those organisations on a fee-for-service basis. These sports deserve special recognition for their strong self-initiated anti-drug stance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, the incidence of positive drug tests in Australia for prohibited drugs was only 0.2 per cent. This clearly demonstrates that ASDA has had a significant deterrent effect. More importantly, nearly 90 per cent of our elite athletes, surveyed on an annual basis, believe that the ASDA drug testing program has produced that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday, on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> program, elite Australian cyclist Gary Neiwand acknowledged that competition in his sport was now much fairer than it was during the days before the establishment of the Australian Sports Drug Agency. ASDA also remains in close contact with all our elite athletes. Each year an annual survey is conducted to monitor their concerns about drugs in sport issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, athlete advisory groups have been established Australia-wide. Over a hundred athletes are involved in this process, which gives them an opportunity to express their concerns about the drugs in sport issue. These athlete advisory groups are also used by our agency to help prepare information resources. Last year, for example, top Australian swimmer Linley Frame launched the drugs in sport handbook. This provides comprehensive information to all our elite athletes about the drug testing procedures and lists the drugs that are banned and, more importantly, the medications that are permitted and those that are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be seen clearly in the annual report of our Australian Sports Drug Agency that its effectiveness does not solely rely on drug testing. The agency, I am very proud to say, has developed comprehensive education programs for schools and sporting groups. This has been achieved in close association with other sporting organisations, including the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Coaching Council and the Australian Sports Medicine Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with our state governments and sporting organisations, our agency has established sports drug education units in Victoria, New South Wales, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. These education programs are supported by the production and distribution of comprehensive information resources, including videos, drugs in sport handbooks, brochures and teaching kits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 008 hotline service is also provided to give information to our athletes about those medications that may contain banned drugs and those medications which are safe for them to use. The agency also provides funding to the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories, which are the only drug testing laboratories in the Southern Hemisphere, and that enables them to conduct research into new methods to detect banned drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have discussed this issue for the information of members of parliament in this grievance debate because I was so concerned by the headlines, which were bad enough, and reports, which were, I repeat, unsubstantiated, that went against an agency that not only has the bipartisan support of this parliament but also has the support of all our athletes&mdash;champions and future Olympic champions. I commend the agency for the work that it is doing. I wish it well in its future endeavours. I hope that in future newspapers will look more to promoting and projecting the positives of this agency rather than writing reports to the detriment of the agency. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today is with this federal government, which has been in place so long that the stench of death and decay pervades this house of executive government. Really, the greenies ought to be complaining, should they not? The maggots feed on the carcass of this government causing massive pollution in this place. The greenies really ought to complain.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The A team is deserting the ship of state, is it not, like the rats deserting the proverbial sinking ship at sea? Who of the A team has gone? John Dawkins is one. He had many portfolios. He absolutely disrupted the tertiary education sector in this country and fatally stuffed up the budget in 1993. Gone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is John Kerin? John Kerin was seen to be a fair and competent minister for primary industries but then he took on the Treasury portfolio and he did not last very long after that. Kerin has gone. Blewett has gone. Sibraa has gone. Tate has gone. The A team has very nearly gone. The few who are left are getting very tired&mdash;very tired indeed. But two who are still hanging on, albeit by a very thin thread, are the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly)&mdash;the minister for sports rorts and other things&mdash;and the former industry minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister for sports rorts&mdash;or the Kellygate affair&mdash;visited my electorate of La Trobe in Victoria in 1993 as part of the ALP's election campaign, and it might be interesting to examine the chronology of events surrounding a particular grant that was made in that electorate. Things commenced with a proposal for the development of an environment education resource centre at the Cardinia Reservoir Park, Narre Warren East. On 4 August 1992, draft ideas for the development were put forward by Brian Johnson, who was employed as a ranger 1 with Melbourne Water at the Cardinia Reservoir Park. Brian Johnson is a fine young man who put forward the proposal in a project that he was working on as part of the young achiever award program. As I say, he is a very fine young man, but I know that he was used by the ALP machine and dragged into the net of trying to win votes with sports rorts dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the outline of his development proposal, a draft was put up and costed at half a million dollars. Remember that figure&mdash;half a million dollars&mdash;because I will get to the actual amount of the grant later. The estimates&mdash;or guesstimates&mdash;were made up of the following cost components: labour, $150,000; construction material, $250,000; furnishing, $80,000; and landscaping, $20,000. That comes to half a million dollars. But the proposal actually states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . much more research is needed to be able to prepare a final costing.</PARA>
<PARA>On the 28th of that month the application was, theoretically,  received by Mrs Kelly's department. We only know that because she should told us so in a supplementary answer to a question I asked her without notice in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 16 November Mrs Kelly came into my electorate, unannounced and without my knowledge, to support the local ALP candidate for La Trobe, Dr Pain. Mrs Kelly met with Dr Pain and the Friends of Cardinia. I might add that the president of the Friends of Cardinia committee&mdash;I have forgotten his name&mdash;is also the president of the local branch of the ALP. He had also just stood for endorsement&mdash;highly unsuccessfully, I might add&mdash;as the ALP candidate for the state seat of  Pakenham  against  the  Hon.  Rob Maclellan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this Labor Party group got together and used poor Brian Johnson's research work for the young achiever award program. On the 16th, she met all these people and said, `I will provide $150,000 of federal funding for the construction of an environment education resource centre at the park'. The agreement was on the proviso that the amount offered by the federal government could be matched from other sources on a dollar for dollar basis. On 17 November, the next day, the president of Friends of Cardinia Park Reservoir sent out a letter to people in the community saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter is of great urgency, as the Federal grants for environmental projects will be finalised within the next two weeks, and any financial assistance we receive must be agreed to within that period.</PARA>
<PARA>So they had two weeks to find $150,000 as their half of a $300,000 grant for a proposal that was going to cost $500,000 to build. There seems to be something wrong here. Not only is there something rotten in the state of Denmark but there is something rotten in the House of Representatives in Canberra, Australia&mdash;fair dinkum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 November, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Berwick News</EMPHASIS> published a photo of the minister with the caption `Peter Chapple and Dr Geoff Pain look on as federal environment minister Ros Kelly pledges her support to Brian Johnson for an education centre at Cardinia'.

To that extent she was successful. It did not work in my electorate, but heaven only knows why. The project is still on the drawing board as of today. It did not receive the community's support, and the pork barrel continues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other grant in my electorate that was approved was $45,000 for a well-deserved baseball facility, but we also put up, and I supported them actively because they were well-researched programs, one for a regional performing arts centre in Emerald for a quarter of a million dollars, one for Horatio's Preservation Society in the Dandenong Ranges at $40,000 and one for Puffing Billy for $40,000 to help with a bridge construction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to take this opportunity to talk about the weather but given the last speaker's contribution I think I will say a few words about sports grants. Sports grants were, in effect, a way to return power to the people. In these days of centralised executive government, government becoming more and more centralised and more executive dominated, it was like a breath of fresh air to be able to have an input into the allocation of where funds went in an electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be understood is this. The cabinet was aware&mdash;and this explanation is entirely my view&mdash;of the need for some stimulation of the economy at that time. There was no doubt about that and this $30 million was allocated to those areas where it would have the most stimulating effect. By and large it went to areas of most need. Some people say, `Shock horror, most of it went to Labor electorates'. Of course the majority of it would have gone to Labor electorates as they contain the areas of most need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had people on the opposition side saying that the grants went to marginal seats. Now I have the safest Labor seat in Western Australia and my electorate did very well out of these grants. It did well because I lobbied very hard and followed up the applications. I  know that the electorates of some members of the opposition also did well for exactly the same reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one takes my electorate as an example, some of the money in my electorate went to Cundinup an area where, in a good year, I would get 30 per cent of the vote. It is certainly not an area where one would seek to buy votes. I got money for the farmers of Cundinup because they had no other source for the money. Without that money they would not have a centre at Cundinup today, a centre where they can meet and so help to keep the community together. I believe that it was well deserved. I wish it could have been greater and that they could have received it in two consecutive years. I hope the scheme is maintained so that I can get them another grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the north of my electorate in Broome, a very worthwhile project was a swimming pool facility, an aquatic centre. Broome is an area which is very hot in summer but at certain times of the year it is not advisable to swim there and so I thought it was a very worthwhile project. But the representations for that came not from me but from Senator Panizza, a Liberal Party senator from Western Australia. I congratulate him. It was a well deserved project.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other areas of my electorate which received grants. Not one could be said to be undeserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes to the electorate of O'Connor, which is next to my electorate, one comes to what is probably the safest Liberal Party seat in the whole of Australia. The town of Ravensthorpe was apparently told by its member that there was no point in applying since it was a safe Liberal seat and it would not get any funding. As Ravensthorpe used to be in my electorate I was contacted by some of the people. I said, `Send me a copy of your submission. I will have a look at it and see what I can do'. After having read their submission I thought it was good. I then made representations on their behalf and they too received a grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A criterion for most of these grants was that the money could be spent quickly. I noticed the comments of John Taylor, the Auditor-General, and I find them strange. I recall John Taylor as Deputy Secretary to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I understand that he is fond of claiming that administrative accountability in the DAA was at its height during this period. I do not recall it that way. I do not recall there has ever been any great accountability there and there is certainly not any in ATSIC, which brings me to another point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been great concern expressed about the operations of Aboriginal legal services. They clearly need auditing. I am aware that Senator Walsh wrote to the Auditor-General who said that he was unable to audit the Aboriginal legal services unless he was asked to by ATSIC. This is not the situation and I suggest that the Auditor-General concentrate on big money matters instead of chasing rabbits down burrows in all directions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth about these grants is that most of them were paid retrospectively and all of them required local input. The scope for fraud was very limited and if fraud occurred at all then because of the nature of the grants it was on a very small scale. If fraud occurred then I am very eager for those people who benefited to be prosecuted. But in the disbursement of government money, fraud occurs all the time. I would say that the level of fraud here as a percentage of the total was far less than the percentage that occurs in something like the Department of Social Security and I will defy anyone to run a department like the Department of Social Security without encountering some fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what these noble people do is look at these departments without ever taking into consideration the difficulty of dealing with their clientele who are often under stress. They have no idea of conditions that exist in some of these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that some of the grants were anomalous. Certainly, had I been making a decision, I would not have given any money to the Hellenic gun club in South Australia. I do not believe in ethnic clubs any more than I believe in ethnic branches in the Labor Party. I believe they are a scandal. However, the Liberal Party endorses multiculturalism, as does the Labor Party&mdash;it is a concept which I certainly reject. But, given those criteria, one can hardly blame the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) for making an allocation of money to that club. It should also be borne in mind that this is part of their culture and way of life. There are over 10 million registered shooters in southern France and Italy alone and, pro rata, there would be just as many in Greece. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding this grant, which has been criticised by members of the opposition, the community itself put in a large amount of money and the project development is going ahead at Murray Bridge, I understand. Clearly, while one may not like it, as I do not, one cannot criticise the granting of that amount by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something is happening in this parliament that I think is important. The Westminster system of government, of which our system is a loose model, cannot work without an effective opposition. The present opposition has never been effective and that clearly affects the operation of this government. Another thing that detracts from the effective working of a government under the Westminster system is an incompetent, lazy and slothful media. We certainly have that in Canberra. If the media are genuine about this matter, they should be going out to where the grants were delivered and finding examples of where they were not justified. I urge them to come to my electorate and interview the people in my electorate who got grants and see whether any of them feel that their grants were not justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that I am no friend of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I have criticised her as the minister for the environment and I believe that, with the clear exception of a certain senator, she is probably the worst minister this party has ever had. There has been no love lost between me and the minister and, if there was going to be any vindictiveness on the part of the minister, it would clearly rebound on my head. I believe that the minister would have more time for most members of the opposition than she has for me, but it is outrageous for the minister to be pilloried in this way by an opposition that simply has no policy, no sense of direction and no sense of proportion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of things that need to be criticised in government but this is not one of them. This scheme was set up to provide small amounts of seed capital to people in need who would not have got grants in any other way. As far as I can see, the grants were very beneficial in the community. They were certainly liked by the community and by those members of the government and the opposition who used their initiative and actively sought the grants. As I was saying earlier, the government's aim was to get money out into the economy. The government frankly did not give a damn where it was spent as long as it was spent, because the government was looking for macro-economic benefits and not for some short-term, small electoral benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the opposition have said that we targeted marginal Liberal seats. This was an election the Liberal Party expected to win. In the situation of a possible change of government, the losing government does not win marginal seats; it loses them. In any case, how can one possibly prove it one way or the other? The fact is that many marginal Liberal seats got the grants and many marginal Liberal seats benefited from them. I believe the people who benefited in those seats would welcome those grants and would think that the system was a good one and should be continued. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate today to raise some very serious concerns that I have about the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), the Health Insurance Commission, the operation of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the problem of generic drug substitution. My motivation for entering into this debate is an extremely worrying series of events that occurred just before Christmas last year. As has been well documented, a pharmacist by the name of Stuart Keen, from my home town of Wingham on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, has allegedly been substituting generic drugs for more expensive brand drugs, where the only effect on patients using the cheaper brand is that it costs them less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keen has adopted the philosophy that he has a duty of care to his patients which not only involves their obvious physical welfare but also their financial welfare. Mr Keen realised that it could be alleged he was breaking the law, but in this case he believes the law is an ass. Mr Keen strongly believes that, in those instances where the patient may be under financial stress, it is not only appropriate but necessary for the pharmacist to advise about financial options. I can clearly sympathise with Mr Keen on moral grounds and I believe the law needs to be addressed urgently with regard to generic substitution. I think it is high time that Senator Richardson stopped talking about problems in the health industry such as this one and started to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give a quick summary of the problem we face in Australia, the issue focuses on confusion for pharmacists in interpreting the minimum pricing policy, which was introduced by the government to increase price competition by allowing drug manufacturers to set their own prices on multi-branded items listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The government can subsidise a drug to the lowest priced brand but the manufacturer can charge more for a particular brand. Therefore, if the patient is prescribed a brand which is priced higher than the benchmark price, the patient pays the brand premium, that is, the price difference between the lowest priced brand and the brand prescribed. Stuart Keen probably summarised the problem best when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum pricing policy deregulates the price of drugs to allow prices to be set at what the market will bear, yet doctors won't allow their patients to have a choice. What I'm doing is giving them that choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the government has brought in a policy about drug pricing, but the National Health Act hasn't been modified to allow that policy to be implemented properly.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Richardson has talked at length on this topic. He has been made fully aware of the circumstance to which I refer and still he has not acted on it. This concerns me greatly, because two days before Christmas last year Stuart Keen had 33 criminal charges laid against him by the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;all due to his stance against current government policy on generic substitution. Since then the public prosecutor has taken away five of the charges and added two more, so Mr Keen currently has 30 criminal charges outstanding against him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to stay as objective on this matter as I possibly can, but when I hear reports that the Health Insurance Commission actually withheld the court summons for several weeks in a vindictive attempt to intimidate Mr Keen, and then ruined his Christmas by delivering it only a few days before&mdash;a time when, as we all know, the legal fraternity takes off for a month, so he could not seek any legal advice during that period&mdash;I say that we should all become gravely concerned about it. My allegation can be sustained. The summons was issued on 12 November in Sydney, yet the local police at Wingham did not receive it until 22 December. That is a severe time disadvantage to Mr Keen in preparing his case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was not the only case of intimidation directed at Mr Keen. For example, last Tuesday Mr Keen was expected in court at 10.00 a.m. to adjourn hearing of the charges to a later date, but at 5.09 p.m. on the Monday five charges were dropped and two more were added. Essentially, the public prosecutor gave Mr Keen one hour's working time to prepare a case for the new charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If reports such as this are true, the Health Insurance Commission must be brought into line, because it is its own summons that it should be tracking through the courts. Such scurrilous activities must never become part of our public bureaucracy, be it in this department or in any other. The action taken in this particular case must be answered for by the Minister for Health himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not advocating the actions of Mr Keen, who has allegedly broken the laws of this country. All I am trying to do is raise this issue in the public forum so that people can be made aware of the situation that is occurring on the mid-north coast of New South Wales: one pharmacist fighting a lone battle against this government in his attempts to change the law. I take my hat off to Mr Keen because it has taken his stance to bring to the attention of this government the obvious inequities in the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have with me a letter from the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, which kindly was passed on by the shadow minister for health. It clearly shows the Minister for Health is talking about the problem and is considering change. Yet this has been dragging on for too long. The Minister for Health has raised issues in his letter of 20 January 1994, which he was also raising six months ago. He seems to be stalling on this issue under the disguise of minimum pricing policies and loopholes in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From his letter, the ridiculous thing is that Senator Richardson is obviously in full agreement with the actions of Stuart Keen, despite allowing the Health Insurance Commission to lay 30 charges against him before Christmas. To emphasise my point, I will quote from the letter signed by Senator Richardson. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is currently  holding discussions with the pharmaceutical industry, pharmacy and medical groups and the state governments (who regulate the practice of pharmacy). The purpose of these discussions is to gain agreement to allow pharmacists to substitute a cheaper brand which is therapeutically equivalent to the more expensive prescribed brand, at the request of the patient, except where the doctor has endorsed the prescription to the contrary.</PARA>
<PARA>By these statements, Senator Richardson obviously sympathises, as I do, with the plight of Stuart Keen. This begs a series of questions. Why did the Minister for Health allow the Health Insurance Commission to lay the original 33 charges against Mr Keen if he is actually in sympathy with him? Why did the Minister for Health allow the Health Insurance Commission to lay charges against Mr Keen when it seems that in the next few months Senator Richardson, by the content of his own letters and articles published, looks likely to drop his own government's policy and adopt the approach taken by Mr Keen? Finally, why did the Minister for Health allow the Health Insurance Commission to delay the delivery of the court summons by several weeks until Christmas Eve in an obvious attempt to intimidate Mr Keen during the Christmas season?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot believe the bureaucratic heavy-handedness that Mr Keen has had to put up with throughout his solo campaign to improve the health care system in Australia. Mr Keen has been subjected to extraordinary intimidation and abuse by members of the bureaucracy, by members of the Health Insurance Commission. I instance this one story which, only by a strange coincidence, I have been able to hear. On 12 January 1993, two officers from the Health Insurance Commission&mdash;one by the name of Owen Moore&mdash;stormed into Stuart Keen's pharmacy at Wingham, and began verbally abusing the man they thought to be Mr Stuart Keen. After realising that the man was not Stuart Keen, but the pharmacist in charge of the pharmacy at the time, they stormed out of the pharmacy as quickly as they had arrived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange twist to this story is that Wingham, being a small town and also being my home town, the locum in attendance that day just happened to be my father. He received the verbal abuse from the officers of the Health Insurance Commission. It was he, as I say, who copped the tirade of these officers. They should not be allowed to do this. The taxpayers in this country pay their taxes to pay these people their wages. It does not take much to act in a civilised manner. These officers certainly have not acted in a civilised manner in the way they have dealt with this issue. Such bureaucratic heavy-handedness should never take place in Australia, regardless of the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now I realise perfectly well that Mr Keen has allegedly been breaking the law under the current system. But in a moral sense I admire Mr Keen for his efforts to improve the system by showing the obvious flaws in the current system, and by standing firm in his protest against what is, to him, a ridiculous burden that the people of Australia are faced with when buying their prescription drugs. My interest in this begins and ends with the actions of the Minister for Health and the Health Insurance Commission. However, I simply cannot believe that the minister, about to adopt the approach that Stuart Keen has been using, at the same time thanks Stuart Keen for his initiative by presenting him with a courtroom summons on Christmas Eve, charging him with allegedly dispensing generic drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been dragging on for too long with no satisfactory outcome or improved policy direction in this country, and it is certainly an unsatisfactory outcome for Stuart Keen with court action about to take place. I therefore call on the Minister for Health to address these questions and allegations and to review the individual circumstances of the Stuart Keen case. For the people of Australia, I call on the Minister for Health to come to a decision about generic substitution and to make the obvious decision to follow the lead of Mr Stuart Keen, so that people buying drugs on prescription are no longer burdened with extra costs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a matter which I know to be as close to your heart as it is to mine. I wish to speak in this grievance debate on the managed investments review currently being conducted by the Department of Social Security, under the aegis of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) previously spoke on this issue in this House. She said that the opposition and the coalition had forced the government into a review. I have said before in this place, and I will say it again, that that is very far from the truth. What happened was that a number of people from the backbench&mdash;I was one of them&mdash;had long discussions with the Minister for Social Security. I believe that that is what spurred this review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review is needed for a number of reasons. First, it should be said that there has been no attempt by the government to rort or to be dishonest over this whole issue. What has taken place, as the minister quite properly determined, is that there was an area of wealth which was escaping the notice of the taxation department and impacting on social security. It was his responsibility to address that matter and to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with unrealised assets being assessed as income. I say quite categorically that I disagree with that. I favour a system of voluntary retirement at 55, with a package of benefits and a system whereby retirement investment can be placed in a way which is beneficial both to our nation and to the people involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have done a lot for pensioners and for self-funded retired people. Some of the items in the last budget took that even further. What I would like to see is all these moves being repackaged into one easily understood system whereby there is security for our aged, self-funded retirees, superannuants and pensioners. Their main gripe is basically getting access to the pension they feel they are entitled to receive, as well as to medical and fringe benefits cards. The ability to get in and do something about it is there. That is what the review is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of how these managed investments are taxed, it may well be that it would be much better to tax those investments through the capital gains tax when they are realised rather than doing it in the way that it is being done at present. One of my constituents had 19 changes made to their pension between March and September. The comment that was made by the department was, `There weren't 19 pay periods, so that's impossible'. The reality is that in a number of instances people had two changes and, in one case, three changes in one week to their pension entitlement. We are talking about people in our community who, according to demographic studies, are more law-abiding than any other section of our community. They are people who want security in their old age and certainty in their income. I believe that this government can deliver those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to do, therefore, is to repackage what we have already done in a manner which allows them to have investments. I suggest to the members of the National Party of Australia&mdash;who, I concede, have been very good in their approach to this matter&mdash;that housing funding and the funding that goes to our farming community would make very appropriate investments for the elderly of our community, because they would then be looking after the housing needs of their children and grandchildren as well as the long-term interests of the farming community&mdash;which, quite frankly, has been screwed by the banks over the last 10 years. The difference in interest rates in this country at the moment shows that the banks are on the best wicket they have been on for over 20 years, and yet they have no concern for the ordinary Australians they supposedly service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members, we should recognise that mature Australians have a right to security. They have a right to be able to make their investments in such a way that they can benefit the country. They have a right not to be required to try to engage in rorts or shonky deals or to hide income or put it away. My submission to that review will be a positive one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done some very good things for our aged community and we have much to be proud of. However, that does not mean that the game is over. We still need to put in an effort for these people so that they have the security of knowing what their pension is going to be,  not only this week, but next week and in four weeks time. Currently, they do not have that security. </PARA>

This is already mandatory in parts of Europe and will probably become so throughout all the Australian states.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Hilton bombing, its aftermath and the involvement of a variety of police and security agencies, have obviously been the subject of great scrutiny over many years. Certainly the honourable member has raised the question in this place on a number of occasions. It is true that the parliament of New South Wales has requested that the Commonwealth join with the government of New South Wales in the holding of a joint royal commission into the Hilton bombing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the position of this government, which I have reaffirmed, that the Commonwealth would not agree to be involved in a joint royal commission. However, if the New South Wales government wishes to set up a commission, which it obviously has the full power to do, then I can assure this House&mdash;as the government has on many occasions previously indicated&mdash;that there would be full cooperation from all Commonwealth agencies and authorities into the conduct of that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detail of the various responsibilities of the agencies involved in the security arrangements for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is well known. It has been the Commonwealth's position that no Commonwealth agency has acted in an improper way. If that view is not shared by the New South Wales government and it wishes to inquire further, then let it proceed down that path and, I repeat: there will be full cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member mentioned the $17 million spent on war crimes. The Commonwealth in that case had very clear evidence in front of it, following on from the Menzies commission of inquiry into the alleged entry into Australia of European war criminals and the subsequent investigation of that by the special war crimes investigations unit, that there were cases to be answered. It was the Commonwealth's decision that such evidence could not be ignored and that cases needed to be determined by Australian courts. In the event, no particular conviction was successful. Nonetheless, given the very clear evidence brought forward during that process, it would have been irresponsible of the government to have walked away from evidence of the involvement of people in this country in what, undoubtedly, was the greatest crime against humanity of this century. I do not think the Commonwealth could have taken any other position than the one it took in that matter. In relation to the Hilton bombing, I believe that the ball is in the court of the New South Wales government if it wishes to proceed with an inquiry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question raised by the honourable member for Perth enables me to advise the House that the government's forecast for the budget outcome for this year is now for a notably lower deficit than that which was forecast in the budget last August. The House will recall that last week I gave revised economic outlook figures for GDP, inflation, employment and the unemployment rate. Honourable members will recall that GDP moved up from 2 3/4 per cent to 3 1/2 per cent growth this year. Inflation is down 1 1/2 per cent, from 3 1/2 per cent to two per cent. Employment is up one per cent, from three quarters of a per cent growth to 1 3/4 per cent. The participation rate is up by three quarters of a per cent and the unemployment rate remains much the same, at around 10 3/4 per cent. In the light of today's continued reduction in the unemployment rate, that figure might be starting to look a little bit conservative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications of this for the budget outcome are that outlays are expected to be around a quarter of a billion dollars higher than at budget time. The economic improvements reduce outlays by some $300 million, but other factors will swamp that improvement. They include the post-budget decisions to amend or remove some budget measures to reduce outlays and also higher than expected outlays on a number of social security payments. All up, outlays increase by about a quarter of a billion dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the revenue side, the improved economic parameters mean that gross pay-as-you-earn receipts are now expected to be $1.3 billion higher than was budgeted for. The net effect of the variations to other receipts is to add a further $0.2 billion&mdash;$200 million&mdash;to revenue. So revenue will increase all up by about $1 1/2 billion dollars. In the overall budget outcome, which has outlays up by a quarter of a billion dollars and revenue up by $1 1/2 billion, the deficit is reduced by $1 1/4 billion, from the $16 billion that we budgeted for to $14 3/4 billion now. As a percentage of GDP, that takes it down from 3.8 per cent at the time of the budget to 3 1/2 per cent now.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that these figures are still only estimates; there could be considerable variations when the final results are posted. But there seems little doubt that the end result will be much better than was originally forecast in the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is clearly very good news for the economy and the nation. It demonstrates quite clearly the capacity of economic recovery to assist the process of restoring the budget outcome. The government is of course very much committed to reducing the deficit to around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We have made that our objective over the last couple of years and it remains our objective. These announcements today clearly take us a further step along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do need to sound a note of caution: it does not necessarily follow that the benefits of the budget for 1993-94 from the improved economic growth will automatically flow into 1994-95. Although it is very early days to be making these forecasts, our expectation at the moment would be that we will not receive the same boost to the budget outcome in 1994-95 as we appear likely to receive in 1993-94. This is principally because, although we expect GDP to be growing strongly in 1994-95, low inflation could mean that nominal GDP will be less than had been previously anticipated, so the revenue improvement of 1993-94 may not run through into 1994-95. Nevertheless, it is very early in the piece to be making these judgments and the likely budget outcome for 1994-95 will be much clearer by the time we come to the May budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we can be absolutely sure about is that the outlook is for continued economic recovery with low inflation, substantial employment growth and declining unemployment. I can assure the House that in the May budget the government will be making every attempt to further encourage and nurture those very favourable developments.</PARA>

So, according to Bronwyn Bishop, even when confronted with a currency crisis, the 10-day period of consultation and discussion within the government should have occurred and then at some point an action taken in response to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One really wonders what would have occurred in those 10 days if Bronwyn Bishop had been the Treasurer. I suppose day one would have produced a telephone call to Paris to find out whether Trevor Boucher had hedged his salary against downward movements of the Australian dollar. If the answer were yes, immediate recall; if the answer were no, immediate recall on the grounds of stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Day two would have been spent in a frenetic Commonwealth car trip around Sydney to various points of interest; and day three would have been spent giving the old gold pass a real work-out between Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra and then a discussion with the press about how much stamina she had in the face of the economic turmoil around her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On day four she would have burst into a press conference for Senator Schacht, who would be opposition science spokesman. She would have said to Senator Schacht that quite clearly he was planning at some point three or four years down the line, after the next election, to organise a golden parachute for someone. On day five&mdash;this would probably be the end of the country&mdash;there would have been a seance around the cabinet table at which she would have discussed whether or not the 10-day rule would be observed, and they would call up the ghost of Sir Otto Niemeyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case the businessman thought that this was just an offhand remark by Bronwyn Bishop and not a serious strategy, all was revealed later in the course of Bronwyn Bishop's speech. Bronwyn, spokesperson for the opposition, genuinely wants a low Australian dollar. That is the reason why she criticised the then Treasurer for not observing the 10-day rule. An economist said that he got the impression that she thought merchandise trade surpluses with some of the Asian economies were actually a bad thing&mdash;`What we need to do is to induce a currency crisis and organise bad merchandise trade deficits with our Asian economies in order to produce in the course of that a 20c dollar'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She had a few other ideas on how we might deal with the economy. While all this was going on, she evidently proposed that she should take a trip to Germany. She says that during the 1980s she visited the Bundesbank and evidently buttonholed some unfortunate on the front desk and asked the official what would happen if she went around and gave everybody in Germany a credit card with 1,000 marks on it. She then revealed herself to be a dab hand with Colonel Klink accents because she evidently then said to this gathering of economists that she had his assurance that if she were to hand everybody a 1,000 mark credit note the Bundesbank would actually do something about it. With these revelations, she further confused her audience at CEDA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She shares two things in common with the Leader of the Opposition. On the analysis of one fellow:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The speech was full of contradictions. Did she want to re-regulate, deregulate? She seems content with motherhood statements.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1986 and 1992 our elaborately transformed manufactured exports grew by over 19 per cent a year, whereas the global trade from the UN database of elaborately transformed manufactures over the same period was 11.3 per cent&mdash;19 per cent for Australia in the growth of elaborately transformed manufactures and 11 per cent for the world in general. Indeed, Australia's performance was the fastest of all OECD economies. These data also confirm the importance of East Asia as the most dynamic trading area in the world. While our growth in ETMs has outstripped those in the OECD, a number of our Asian neighbours have experienced even more rapid growth, with Indonesia heading the countries surveyed with an annual increase of elaborately transformed exports of 35 per cent. Thailand was next with 32 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple message is that we have been getting things right domestically. That is as a result of our being well placed to take advantage of the burgeoning market in the region and the growth of elaborately transformed manufactures in the Asia-Pacific. This is coming from our 30 per cent improvement in competitiveness, the two per cent inflation rate, the lowest interest rates for 20 years, profit levels approaching record highs, subdued wages, a cooperative and skilled work force and the lowest tax country in the Western world. All of these things have meant that in this area we have seen a tremendous improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That growth is coming through the economy. We are seeing the economy pick up and accelerate. We are seeing that change the budget figuring, as the Treasurer indicated earlier in question time. That is also now flowing into the labour market, as my colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training also indicated at question time. Today's labour force figures are an indication of that. They are very encouraging news for the labour market, for its long-term future and for the unemployed&mdash;with 145,000 job growths since August over that five-month period, a further 22,000 persons employed in the course of last month and the unemployment rate dropping slightly again to 10.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said, this puts the government well on the way to meeting its 500,000 job forecast for the three years, a forecast which was derided by the Leader of the Opposition at the time it was announced. In the same forecast of 1983, for 500,000 in the term, we actually surpassed it by 200,000. On this occasion we are well on the way to meeting the 500,000 job figure for the three-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is very good news on the labour market and good news on jobs. This should be comforting and encouraging to the Australian community. It comes from the massive transformation of the economy being led by exports and, most particularly, by elaborately transformed manufactures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very great privilege to be called to answer the last question in this place from the retiring member for Bonython, who has espoused the values of tolerance and internationalism in such a way as to leave him, as I think, one of my most distinguished predecessors in this portfolio, and one of the most respected ministers this House has seen. I believe that he will leave the House with those values intact, and one hopes that they will be used to great effect in whatever occupation awaits him in the future. He is not only our most distinguished and longest serving Minister for Health and the father of Medicare but, in my own portfolio of development cooperation, he was one of those who made the Australian aid program well respected around the world. I wish him well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the substance of the honourable member's question. The House heard from the Prime Minister earlier in the week of the concern which is felt by all Australians at the awful carnage which is being wreaked in the former Yugoslavia and of the intention of the Australian government to add, in so far as it is within its means, to the efforts that we have made of a humanitarian kind to assist the victims of that carnage. I have today agreed to a further increase in Australian humanitarian aid to Bosnia, to the former Yugoslavia, worth an additional $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with most of our previous aid to people in the former Yugoslavia, the bulk of this additional assistance will be provided through international agencies. Those agencies have the ability to get aid through to the victims of the conflict, often in the most difficult of circumstances, and they are respected for their impartiality as between the various victims of the conflict and for their efficiency in getting the aid through. It is for those reasons that $650,000 will be provided to continue our support for relief activities which are run by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Committee of the Red Cross. In respect of those, the UNHCR is the lead agency in the former Yugoslavia and it is facing a massive shortfall in the funds available to it. So Australia's additional assistance of $550,000 to that body will help it meet pressing needs for shelter, heating and medical treatment. I have also allocated $100,000 to the ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross, particularly to help it trace displaced persons and to treat the civilian casualties of the fighting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognition of the considerable trauma which has been inflicted on women, especially those women who have been sexually assaulted during the conflict, I have allocated $50,000 to Austcare's women's shelter in Zagreb which caters for refugees and rape victims. I am proud to say that this centre is being run by two very dedicated Australians and I am very proud that the government has been able to support the efforts they are making. In addition to that, I have made arrangements for $300,000 from funds which were previously allocated to CARE Australia for relief projects in Africa, which it has proved impossible to utilise fully, to be available to support its trucking operations which deliver relief throughout the former Yugoslavia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This announcement brings to $3.35 million the total amount of assistance which the Australian government has provided to people in the former Yugoslavia since the conflict began. While it will help to alleviate some of the suffering which has been so graphically illustrated by the slaughter of weekend shoppers in Sarajevo, as the Prime Minister said earlier in the week, that suffering will continue until the warring parties can be prevailed upon to agree and adhere to a lasting peace. Australia will continue to add its efforts to that enterprise.</PARA>

It is a year that promises outstanding success for the tourism industry because an unprecedented number of Asian visitors have decided to celebrate Chinese new year in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for airline seats has meant that Qantas and a number of prominent Asian airlines have had to schedule an extra 40 flights just to cope with the demand of Asians who want to celebrate Chinese new year in Australia. These extra flights will include 22 from Taiwan, 14 from Hong Kong and two each from Singapore and Korea. This means that about 10,000 extra Asian visitors have decided to come to Australia to welcome in the Year of the Dog. This translates to a $25 million boost to the Australian tourism industry&mdash;something that I would hope all honourable members would welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of the additional visitor expenditure will not be concentrated just in Sydney; additional flights are scheduled for Cairns, Brisbane and Melbourne. The good thing is that this influx will help fill a period which has traditionally been quiet, especially in the accommodation sector. This is not just a one-off event; we are getting phenomenal rates of growth from countries such as Taiwan and Korea, with about a 70 per cent increase over the previous year's figures. This will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's efforts to expand Asian tourism to Australia can be contrasted with some comments which have been made in recent days by people on the other side of this House.

<PARA>this is the honourable member for Kennedy; a Queensland National Party member&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for an international airport to cater not for Australians but for very rich foreigners who are visiting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Forget about the need to provide better terminal facilities for the increasing number of aircraft that will be using Brisbane airport; forget about the extra export earnings for Australia through the tourism industry; forget about the extra investment that will be encouraged; forget about the extra jobs for young Australians&mdash;the honourable member for Kennedy says that we have to be worried about foreign visitors using a new terminal at Brisbane. I do not know what the constituents of the electorate of the honourable member for Moncrieff are when they use the international terminal at Brisbane!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes to show that, at the moment, we have on the record the Queensland Nationals saying that they are opposed to tourism infrastructure spending because rich foreigners benefit. That is the position of the Queensland Nationals. The Queensland Nationals are worried about the extra export earnings, the extra investment, the extra jobs! This is slightly different from the views of some members of the opposition. The shadow minister for tourism and aviation, when visiting a New South Wales Nationals electorate&mdash;that of the honourable member for Cowper&mdash;had a different view on foreigners visiting and using our airport facilities. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Coffs Harbour Advocate</EMPHASIS>, which I am sure is a very prominent newspaper on the north coast, there is a story under the headline `Jull supports airport push', which states:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Bonython)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On reflecting on my 17 years experience in this House, I recognise that my generation of Labor politicians&mdash;that is, those who first entered this House in the 1970s and who are now approaching the sere and yellow leaf of life&mdash;has been an extremely fortunate generation. We were not condemned to live long years in the wilderness as were our colleagues under Dr Evatt and Arthur Calwell. Nor did we have only a limited, if rather euphoric, brief period of government like those under Gough Whitlam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in fact the most fortunate generation yet of Labor politicians at the national level. Those of us who were ministers&mdash;and most of that generation were&mdash;have very great reason to be grateful to the Australian people. I, particularly, have reason to be so to my electors in Bonython, who supported me in both the good and bad times, and to my caucus colleagues for the support they gave to me and to those other members of that generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did spend a stint in opposition, which was of value to us. I am not necessarily recommending it, but a short period in opposition does a number of things. It hones one's political steel and it breeds a gritty determination not to let it happen again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I suspect that a long stint in opposition must be pretty demoralising and disillusioning. In one sense, I regret that Jim Carlton, who came into the House the same day as I did and who became a personal friend, had so little time in his many years in this place to make full use of his undoubted governing and administrative talents. Yet, of course, his disappointment reflected our success, and such are the cruelties of adversarial politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in 1977 when I came in, it was we who were dispirited. We had had the trauma of 1975 and the second crushing electoral defeat of 1977, which had convinced many in the Labor Party that we were doomed again to languish in the wilderness for many long years. That we did not was, above all, due to the first Labor leader under whom I served&mdash;Bill Hayden. His achievement in those years was to convince the Labor Party to have faith in itself. Through hard but unspectacular work, he built a new team, developed new policies, reformed the Labor Party and mobilised the opposition. I have long thought that the leadership of the federal opposition is the most demanding and thankless task in federal politics, succoured only by the promise of ultimate reward&mdash;and, of course, Bill Hayden did not get that reward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foundations of Labor's achievements in the 1980s were built by Bill Hayden. The electoral victory of 1983 was as much Hayden's victory as Hawke's. Hawke's team was very much Hayden's team. Many of the policies, particularly the social policies of the Hawke government, were conceived under Hayden in opposition. Hayden's own blend of tough, realistic economic policies with strong social commitments were characteristic of the social democratic project in this country in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to power, the greatest challenge for the Hawke government was to reach an accommodation with the dominant intellectual climate of the time, of the decade, which very much favoured free and open markets, deregulation and the privatisation of government enterprises. Thus we floated the dollar, opened the Australian system to competition, dismantled protection, embraced the GATT, undertook judicious privatisation and began the erosion of regulation. Given the intellectual climate of the time, no government could have survived without that accommodation. More importantly, I believe that most of these policies, however difficult for many in our own party, were, in the long term, both necessary and desirable for the economic good of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superficial comparisons were often made with other conservative regimes in the Western world. Often those comparisons admitted subtle distinctions between the economic policies pursued here and those in other countries in the Western world. But those comparisons did ignore entirely two other aspects of what I call the social democratic project in Australia in the 1980s that make that project unique. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, change was done in this country in cooperation with organised labour, not against it. There has been much talk over time in the Labor Party about the solidarity of the labour movement, the unity of the political and industrial wings of the party. If we look at our national record, more often in the past that has been breached and broken. In a way, it has been more honoured in the breach than in the fact. But under this government the accord has been the sheet anchor of government, the symbol of the solidarity of Labor in facing the difficult policy challenges of the 1980s and 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second distinction is that the economic changes we followed through in that period were accompanied by significant social change. One cannot forget the other side of the government's effort in the 1980s. The economic rationalist arguments were turned against some of its own most fervent supporters with the capital gains tax and fringe benefits measures. Medicare, a national health scheme, was at last introduced into this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a massive transformation of the social security system under Brian Howe. I believe that the family allowance supplement, now the additional family payment, is the most significant single new benefit in this country since the old age pension. I recognise again that it was built on ideas that came originally from the opposition. The most substantial overhaul of services for the aged in the history of the Commonwealth took place in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a revolution in school retention rates. In the new areas, there was much pioneering work done in environmental protection, in women's rights and in child care. I think we in this country often do ourselves a disservice by selling the country short, by selling our achievements short. What needs to be said is that the social democratic project in Australia is the most significant and now the most successful in the Western world in the last decades of the 20th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the leaders I served under, Bob Hawke, presided over most of this period. As a manager of men and women, Bob Hawke had few peers. I suppose that history will regard his most significant achievement as his ability to shift profoundly the ideology and policies of our party without any serious fracture or disruption. When we consider the fissiparous history of the Labor Party in this country, that is a magnificent achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking forward, I spoke of the luck of my generation of Labor politicians. I suspect that the present generation might be equally fortunate, because the structures of electoral behaviour now favour the Labor Party. The peak of the Liberal cycle which saw them victorious in most of the states in the last four years has almost certainly passed and trends are likely now to move in Labor's favour. The congruence of the economic cycle and the electoral cycle in the mid-1990s for the first time since 1984 will work in Labor's favour. The general conservatism of the electorate, allied with the fact that, by 1996, over one-third of the electorate will never as adults have known any other national government but a Labor one will also tend to favour the incumbent government&mdash;not, of course, that victory can be determined in this kind of way. Much will depend on luck, accidents, performance and perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much too will depend on the third of the leaders under whom I served, Paul Keating. Of course, at this stage we cannot attempt a historic verdict on the present Prime Minister. But to me it is inconceivable that we could have won the last election against the tide if he had not been our leader. Even then, he needed some help from the opposition. He is, as we all know, an extraordinary mixture of a visionary, a masterly persuader and a political street fighter. I think it is the working out of these elements which will do much to determine the fate of this government in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I just want to speak of three proposals with which I was particularly associated, the first being Medicare. After 10 years it is now established and popular as the basis of our health system. I believe that, hopefully, we will now finish the debate on principles and both sides can work together to improve the system that exists. No system is immutable and we should be constantly looking at ways in which we can improve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed in this country to a mixed private and public system and, therefore, we need to pay attention to the levels of private insurance. But, in doing so, we have to watch that any short-term steps do not endanger the basic principles of Medicare. Moreover, any decent health economist will tell you that the levels of private insurance are a third or fourth order subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central issue for the health system is the working of the public hospital system, and I can be completely bipartisan here. I believe that the hospital reforms introduced by Mrs Tehan in Victoria are the most imaginative set of reforms to deal with the hospital system in this country in the last half a dozen years. I notice that they are now likely to be taken up by other Liberal and Labor governments around the country. Those reforms will do much to sustain the public hospital side of Medicare, provided they are not used simply to save money, and one always has to watch that danger. By using the casemix approach, Mrs Tehan has inaugurated a whole new development in hospital systems in this country. The Commonwealth has always supported that casemix approach and I hope we, as a government, will continue to work with Mrs Tehan and other reforming state health ministers in supporting the casemix approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to refer to another area I was deeply involved with&mdash;that is, AIDS. I think we as a community can be rightly proud of our response to the AIDS epidemic and this parliament to its bipartisan approach. But we cannot afford to be complacent in this area. There is a continuing need for community awareness and a constant need to inform each generation of young people of the dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also note that Asia, which was the last continent to be affected by the AIDS virus, is now facing a rapidly rising number of cases. Given the whole thrust of our foreign policy, I think we have a responsibility to Asia in that area, particularly as we have much greater experience and expertise in handling this disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we will debate parliamentary reform this afternoon. I do hope that, despite many of the controversies about one or two aspects of that reform, this parliament will see it as a package which I hope will help to restore confidence in and respect for this institution and its members. I hope too that the reformed sitting hours will do something to relieve some of the pressures placed on the families of members who are asked to make many sacrifices. I know too well the impact of such pressures on our families. In this regard, I want to thank my daughter, Susan, and my son, Simon, for their healthy puncturing of all my pomposities and for their love, understanding and support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) on his valedictory speech. Of course, he is only a new boy in the place. He came in 1977. I am glad to see that the other sole remaining member of the class of 69, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), is in the chamber. There were 28 of us who came into parliament in 1969. Unfortunately, there was a predominance on the Labor side&mdash;23 of those 28 were from the Labor Party and five were from my side. But it was not a bad class. Of the 28 of us, 11 finished up as ministers, one became Prime Minister and another became deputy leader of my party. Therefore, I think we can be quite proud of the contribution that the sixty-niners have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that things were very different in those days. These days it seems that people rush in and make their maiden speech on the same day as they arrive. I was a little different. I did not make my maiden speech until 1970. I made it on the Wheat Stabilisation Bill 1970, which caused a bit of controversy because Warringah is not known as a premium wheat growing area. The Country Party, as it was then known, thought that a new junior Liberal Party member leading off the debate in the second reading stage was a little unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The speakers in those days were perhaps a little more assiduous in maintaining the standing orders. One could not use the Wheat Stabilisation Bill 1970 as a vehicle for speaking glowingly about the electorate of Warringah or what I wished to do in a number of other areas in the parliament over the years ahead. So I will take the opportunity to mention a couple of those things here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being in the parliament is an enormous privilege and, as the honourable member for Bonython has said, that is capped, if you are privileged enough, by becoming a minister. Becoming a minister gives you the opportunity, as no other position does, to put into practice some of the things that you would like to see done. I remember my ministerial role in a couple of ministries with very great affection because it gave me the opportunity of proving not only that I could work long hours and hard but also that we as a government could do many things for people which otherwise they would not be able to hope for. I think particularly of the difficulties in the immigration and ethnic affairs area when Australia faced a challenge which it had never faced before&mdash;the potential arrival of hundreds of thousands of distressed refugees from Indo-China in small boats. We as a government and I as the minister helped to deal with that situation in a way which, I believe, did Australia great credit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the prime ministership of Malcolm Fraser has been denigrated far too much&mdash;not so much by his political opponents, but by those who should be his political supporters. In the sweep of history great achievements were made by the Fraser ministries. His prime ministership will be seen as one when great advances were made. The honourable member for Bonython was kind enough to refer to one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All political careers have some high points and they also seem to have a few low points, as you may have noticed, Mr Speaker. I guess that I have had my share of low points, but then again, as the song says, `Too few to mention'. I am sorry that my colleague and friend the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) is not in the House because, although they might have knocked a few spots off us on the political side of things, we never lost a doubles match against the Senate in 17 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many areas I would like to talk about, but I do not think that this is the sort of speech to dwell on the past. I want to talk about the future and what I hope to see coming from members on both sides of this House. I am very concerned that there is a great alienation, particularly amongst the younger people in the community. I think that all political parties should be concentrating very hard on developing policies which will bring back, especially to young people, a sense of personal worth, a feeling that how they live their lives and the contribution their lives can make to the greater good really matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, I find that a lot of young people see no worth in their lives. They fear the future. They do not know what it holds for them. That is very sad. I come from outside a little country town in the north-west of New South Wales. I remember growing up there, where everybody, no matter what their station in life&mdash;whether they were a boundary rider, a rabbiter or owned the biggest property around the place&mdash;had a sense of personal worth. Their sense of personal worth was recognised by the other members of the community. Particularly in large cities these days, I find that sense of personal worth missing. I believe that we should be doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other areas I would like to mention relates to the environment. We live in the most ecologically sensitive geographic area in the world. The continent of Australia is, ecologically, extremely fragile. We have not always appreciated that. We should pay far more attention to what that fragility means for the future of people living in this country and how they treat it. Our environment is not as forgiving in an ecological sense as other countries around the world. If we do not understand it and if we do not start to adapt our policies to take that fragility very much into consideration, then so much of Australia will be devastated and will not become available for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should be looking very carefully, for instance, at population size. I do not hear too much discussion about ideal population sizes for Australia. We tried to deal with that in the 1970s. Because Australia is so big some people have put forward the view that we can accept hundreds of millions of people. I do not believe that to be the case. We have to look very carefully at population strategies and land management strategies in the future, particularly in rural areas. Much more consideration at all levels of government has to be devoted to that. I believe that urban and regional planning in Australia leaves an enormous amount to be desired. We really have to look very much more carefully at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I would also like to mention parliament itself. All of us must remember that we are but part of a continuum. We are here for a little while and then we go away. If we do not understand that, then we can do very great damage to the institution which is absolutely an underpinning of our democracy here in Australia. If we by our actions, and future members by their actions, tear down the public standing of the parliament, then we are tearing down the very future of democracy in this country. Leaders of parties have a very great responsibility in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating changes to the standing orders. I do not think that at this stage of the debate we have addressed the problem of an attitude towards this place. When I came into the parliament&mdash;and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) was in the parliament&mdash;question time was a vital, active, involved time for the chamber. People were jumping up on both sides of the House. Since that time the chamber has become sterile, there has not been the participation that used to be evident, and its public impact has diminished to an extraordinary degree. That has been brought about by successive leaders of governments and leaders of oppositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must have, in my view, a commitment to an attitude which allows and encourages people to participate. Question time is so structured these days that everybody who has not been given a question to ask is fairly divorced from the proceedings of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had today a marvellous example of how things can change here in the parliament. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) a question without notice. I assume it was without notice because I know there is no collusion between the honourable member for North Sydney and the government&mdash;perish the thought. The fact of the matter is that he asked the question and the Attorney-General, to his great credit, came to the dispatch box and answered it without a note. When I was a minister, all those years ago, if we read an answer it showed to our colleagues and to the opposition that we were not in control of our brief; we did not know what we were talking about and had to rely upon the written answer provided by our department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often over the last few years we have had these long answers to questions written out to such a degree that members of the opposition have been making comments like `page 1' as the minister at the dispatch box turns over to page 2. That, in my view, has to stop. If question time is going to be effective it really has to be about people asking questions without notice and ministers trying to provide short informative answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that it depends very much upon&mdash;and dare I say this&mdash;is the role of the Speaker himself or herself. I very much enjoyed my time sitting in the chair as a deputy chairman of committees. I always wanted to umpire a John McEnroe tennis match. I reckon I could have handled a John McEnroe tennis match. The Speaker is in that role at present. I mention John McEnroe particularly because John McEnroe was a magnificent, talented tennis player, but by his actions&mdash;his tantrums, his performance, his language&mdash;he brought great discredit in many ways to the fine game of tennis. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="014">Mr MacKELLAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He gave the opposition a serve and he copped a few serves himself. But the essential point is that, despite his magnificent tennis talent, he will not be remembered for that; he will be remembered for his display contrary to the spirit of the game. I think there is a lesson in that for all members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the end of the reflections and the hopes for the future. You would think it was very remiss of me if I did not mention the challenge of my new job. Probably nothing instantly springs to your mind when I mention the initials PCAI&mdash;the Plastics, Chemicals and Allied Industries Association. I hope you will be hearing a lot about the PCAI in the future, and I look forward to very close consultations with members of governments and oppositions at all levels of government in Australia. It is a challenging and very exciting job. It is certainly going to occupy my time and give me another challenge. It just shows all members of parliament that there are people out there who are prepared to look for your talents and to provide you with challenging opportunities in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of people I would like to thank. I thank all the people who work in Parliament House. I reckon the people who work in Parliament House are simply terrific. It does not matter what role they have. They work in the committees, they work in the chamber, they work as attendants&mdash;they work all over the place. In my 24 1/2 years here I have never had any trouble or difficulty with those people. I thank them and place on record how very pleasant they have made my stay in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also thank the loyal and constant members of the Liberal Party. As the honourable member for Bonython said, it gets a bit wearing after a number of years in opposition, and that goes as much for the parliamentarians as for the supporters of the party. I have no doubt that their constancy and they loyalty will be rewarded positively in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly mention my staff. I have been extremely fortunate with staff. I had very little money in the electoral coffers when I fought the election in 1969. We could only afford secretarial assistance for three days prior to election day in the election campaign of 1969. This experienced person came to me for those three days and she has been with me ever since. Helen Ovens has done an absolutely fantastic job over the years and is now known as the doyen of the electoral secretaries. Lyle Mark, who has been working with me for a number of years now in Parliament House, is another person who demonstrates continuing efficiency and loyalty in a way which I think we, as members of parliament, are extraordinarily fortunate to experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I cannot speak strongly enough about my wife and family. They have been terrific. Anybody in this place needs support at the family level. As the honourable member for Bonython says, this job places immense strains on individuals and families. As I say, my family has been fantastic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) would say, a good field is lining up at the barrier in the seat of Warringah&mdash;14 starters at this stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the government I extend farewell and best wishes to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). I had, of course, an inkling that the honourable member for Bonython may resign his place in the parliament and I had the opportunity to say some things about him at the end of last year, but he dallied and lingered and I again have the opportunity to say a few brief things about both honourable gentlemen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First I mention the honourable member for Bonython. We on this side of the House will miss him greatly. He was part of that enormous energy the government has had right through the 1980s. He came, as he said, in 1977 after probably our most dispiriting defeat. The year 1975 had all sorts of chemistry about it, but 1977 was simply a straight loss on the chin. As the honourable member has said, that hardened us for other things and made it clear to us that opposition was not the place to stay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate he, as did many others, never wasted the moment. He put as much experience behind him as possible and when he became minister for health in 1983 he was well equipped to establish Australia's first truly universal and deeply comprehensive health system. As a consequence, he and I had the pleasure today of celebrating its 10th anniversary. I think, with much broader political and public support for Medicare now than then, this is a feather in his cap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just Medicare for which we owe him a debt of gratitude, but also for his corporate role in the government and his role as a cabinet minister. I have often remarked here about the role of a cabinet minister as distinct from a portfolio minister. A cabinet minister has to comprehend all of the responsibilities of government, weigh them in the course of deliberations and interest himself or herself in other colleagues' work because that is important to the corporate work of the government. This Neal Blewett did with great dedication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only was his policy view and his interest in issues quite profound, but his sense of judgment and political judgment was very sound indeed. If we took a straw poll in the parliamentary Labor Party of who the pundits might be, we would turn up a lot of obvious names but we might not turn up Neal Blewett. But he was one of the people I always used to ask when I was seeking to put the dipstick into the electoral water. He would invariably give a sensible and thoughtful analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His sense of politics was very finely honed. He had a commitment to what he saw as the building of a social democracy. The government did stand against the breeze, as he said. Part of the government's strength in those days was, in a sense, to survive against the prevailing wind from the northern hemisphere, which was one of Thatcherism and Reaganism, that markets alone mattered and that there was not the place for a decent social policy or an inclusive policy. This government has now put into place a social democracy framework, along with a great change in economic efficiency and outward orientation, which has made the changes of the 1980s so important, not just in Australia but in world terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neal mentioned the accord with the trade unions. Honourable members have heard me say before&mdash;and I will say it again here&mdash;that Labor cabinets always govern with more authority, with the authority of the whole labour movement. By the cooperative relationship with organised labour, many great things were done: occupational superannuation; the family allowance supplement, now called additional family payment, which the honourable member for Bonython mentioned earlier; and the Child Support Agency. These kinds of changes were ones in which I think the support of the organised work force has been important&mdash;and, of course, training and retraining and the whole shift to productivity, part of the changed culture of the country. I think these are remarkable steps for a country. The government has been very fortunate to have the opportunity of longevity to see much of this go into place step by step. No one thing went into place without it fitting. There was a minimum of mortar between the bricks as each brick was built upon the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neal leaves public life and the parliament with a very great and proud record as Minister for Health, Minister for Social Security, and Minister for Trade through the very important years of the GATT round. As he is leaving, with all the gusto and energy he brought to all the other years, he has left us a substantial parliamentary reform. The parliament just this last week has adopted much of it. The consequence is that the parliament will be better, I think, than it was in the past. On behalf of the government, I say, `Farewell and best wishes. No-one on this side could have ever asked more of you than you have given to us'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To Michael MacKellar, let me repeat some of the same sentiments and come to the point, perhaps one of the last points you mentioned&mdash;one of Neal's earliest&mdash;about the parliament. It is true that in days gone by backbench members would stand here, as he and I did in 1969, and ask questions of the government. This is less true now with the notion of highlighting particular high points of policy where, if you like, the rank and file interest of the backbench MP is not as to the fore as it used to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, because members of parliament do have great contact with their electorate, this is a representative chamber. The fact that it is representative, in the sense that members have a close link and affinity with communities, means that they do pick up community concerns. In that kind of parliament, some of the questions which come to the fore are not the obvious ones. They are not the manufactured ones. They are not the ones that are deemed to be asked but ones which come right from left field, which happen to be relevant and often are of great interest in the community at large. I think that character has changed and Michael MacKellar was right in so saying. I am hoping that the changes we have adopted might lead to more opportunity for MPs and that the place is not stylised to the point, as it has become, of focusing simply on the leaders and the front bench of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael came here in the same year as I did&mdash;in 1969&mdash;as I remember, with a background in agricultural science. That is what led him to start off on the debate on the Wheat Stabilisation Bill. I can assure him that it was to the chagrin of the members of the Country Party who in those days believed, particularly on the conservative side of public life, that they had a lien over all such rural matters and rural debate. He contributed in this area over a long period and, of course, came into a government. In 1969 Sir John Gorton was returned to office. Though a lot of the great strides that the Labor Party made in that period were in 1969, the 1972 election was really won in 1969, giving support to Michael MacKellar's point: 23 of the 28 members who came in in 1969 were Labor Party members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He came into a government which was run by a very decent man, John Gorton, with a cabinet which had amongst it a lot of verve and a lot of good figures. I remember well some of the figures, like Tom Hughes who fought with John Gorton in the concrete pipes case to extend the corporations power of the Commonwealth. There were many important things. There was the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who was a solid supporter of the then Prime Minister, and who remains one today&mdash;as, indeed, a few of us do. It is a lot different from coming into an opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That whole notion of government stuck to Michael in the period and, although the Labor Party won the 1972 election and was here until 1975, he came back fairly fresh as a minister in 1975 and held a number of portfolios, including immigration and ethnic affairs and customs. In the immigration and ethnic affairs area he presided over one of the very large changes to the Australian migration program, particularly during and after the Lebanese war when a very large number of Lebanese people migrated to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a very solid contributor to the government in those days and to the Liberal Party in general and was part of that ballast of experience which all parties need. He has stuck out the 10 or 11 years of opposition which have followed. This has been an unusual period historically for the Labor Party. We have never been in office for this long continuously, and he would have had a reasonable expectation of being returned to office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has made a choice, as many members have&mdash;as he said, he and I are the last two of the 1969 group of members to be here&mdash;to take the opportunity of a life's change. He makes it young enough in his life to be able to succeed in it and, no doubt, we will hear more from the plastics industry as a consequence of his leaving the parliament. His remarks about the parliament bear reflection for all of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He commented about Australian youth. We are all very aware of the views of young people in this country. One has to bet on education and say that if we do educate young Australians and the place has a greater level of vitality, that will create its own opportunities. So, while I think it is true that many young Australians are uncertain of the future, part of what will become a more certain future will be their own contribution to it through the education which has been invested in them. I am a great optimist about young people in this country. It is often said that the 1960s generation was the rebellious group, the group that wanted to change the game and open the game up. All that may be true, but, today, wherever you meet a group of young Australians you find an enormous churning of thoughts amongst them and a willingness to change the place and to do things differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity of wishing the honourable member for Warringah, Michael MacKellar, well in the future, and of saying how much all of us who have known him have enjoyed his company as a member of parliament, as a parliamentary colleague. I recognise and salute the fact that he has made a very mature decision to have another life after public life, which I think is the way that all straight-thinking parliamentarians should think; that is to say, we are here for a time, you walk on the stage but, as he himself said so eloquently, you cannot do it forever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the government, I wish Michael and his wife, Robyn, and family well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neal, on our side of the parliament you are known as a substantive and tolerant person and a humanitarian. Focusing on your ministerial career, although I could not agree with some of the things you did and stood for in the health portfolio, I believe you made a substantial contribution in the trade portfolio. We would always judge you as one who was dedicated to improving Australia and Australia's standing in the world. Your fight for freer trade in those international forums in those difficult years will be remembered by this House, and by many on our side of this parliament, as a very significant contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also recognise the contribution that the honourable member for Bonython tried to make in terms of parliamentary reform. Your chairmanship of the Standing Committee on Procedure was seen by us as a genuine attempt to bring about some significant change in the procedures of this place in a way that would improve its operation and restore to question time the true status that it deserved. We always suspected, of course, that in the end your boss would do whatever he decided to do, but you did put in a very genuine effort and we congratulate you in that regard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second person I want to acknowledge is my very good friend the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar). Michael has made an outstanding contribution to the Liberal Party and to Australia over his time in public life, and we are very sorry to see him go. In recent days a lot of us have taken the opportunity to express that view to Michael, but we understand the nature of the decision that he has had to make. I join with the Prime Minister in that regard. It is never an easy choice, but the opportunity that you have taken is a good one. I am sure we will hear a lot about the plastics industry in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time Michael told me of that decision, I could not help thinking of a very famous scene in the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Graduate</EMPHASIS>. I think the graduate was at a cocktail party at his parents' home when he was taken aside by one of his father's inebriated friends and told that he should understand just one word in life, and never forget it, and that was plastics. Plastics is what has obviously influenced you in this decision. Although I congratulate you on that decision, it is with some regret that we see you go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we look over the years that Mike has served in this  place, particularly as a minister, we see a number of significant highlights. I think we should recognise the breadth of his contribution in ministerial portfolios, not only as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, where he served for about four years, but also as Minister for Health, where he served for three years, and as Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister, and Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment, where he served for shorter periods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And, of course, he often used to act for the honourable member for Kooyong in foreign affairs. In opposition he has had shadow portfolios in immigration, foreign affairs and science. I think Michael's true success, and the area where he made his greatest contribution, was in the portfolio of immigration and ethnic affairs. Michael was too modest today to focus on the significance of that contribution, so I thought I would put part of it on the record. I picked up a quote from Michael himself in an article where he spoke quite frankly about his experience in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think we did great with immigration and ethnic affairs in the mid- to late-70s. We led the world in many areas and proved to be a model for other countries.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that is in any sense an exaggeration of the contribution that Michael MacKellar made to the portfolio of immigration and ethnic affairs. Michael's experience in dealing with the Vietnamese boat people has been mentioned, including by Michael himself. It was a very difficult issue, considering the political circumstances and the social pressures of the time. Michael will be remembered for handling that issue both sensitively and sensibly in what were very difficult circumstances. Along with Malcolm Fraser, Michael was instrumental in organising two United Nations conferences on refugees. He really did internationalise an understanding of the problem of refugees. I think that will be long remembered as a very significant contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael also, in conjunction with Malcolm Fraser, commissioned the Galbally report and subsequently implemented most of its recommendations. I think that this represented the first substantive commitment by any Australian government to a multicultural Australia. As a result of this report, we saw the establishment of SBS, wide-ranging proposals in support of new arrivals, the creation of the Migrant Resource Centre and the establishment of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Studies, which later became the Office of Multicultural Affairs. I think that the contributions Michael made in that one portfolio were very significant and will long be remembered not only by us in this parliament but by many others throughout the width and breadth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I looked back over Michael's career, I must say that I was somewhat staggered when I recognised his maiden speech was on wheat quotas. I think this was because he was&mdash;as he described himself at the time&mdash;a country boy at heart and he came from a Country Party family. He may have made that speech on wheat because of an interest gained from academic studies, but certainly some of those ideas have since moved away from Michael's domain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael has also been known as a prodigious reader. One article stated how he liked to read three different books at the same time. On that particular occasion, he was reading an essay on the principle of population, by Malthus, a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Matter Myth</EMPHASIS>, and the other book he was reading was <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Good of the Cause</EMPHASIS> by Solzhenitsyn. You cannot deny that Michael was extremely well read but, if you knew Michael, you would know that that breadth of reading always came through in his advice and in the contributions that he made to our party and to the development of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mike was of course known as an avid sportsperson. It has already been mentioned that he has not lost a doubles match with the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) in 17 years, but he was also a great cricketer and is a pretty good golfer. I do not mind playing golf with Michael but I do not like playing against him because he is a definite burglar on the golf course, as a number of my colleagues would attest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael also founded on our side the wine appreciation society and has therefore brought many good nights&mdash;and sometimes some sore heads&mdash;to many members on our side of politics and we thank him for that. He has, without doubt, one of the most refined palates in the parliament, and he is a delight to have dinner with not only on those occasions but of course at any other time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael and I also share an interest in cars, and he is a familiar sight in his MG sports car. Mike has been known to like to travel. In fact, I looked up part of his parliamentary record on travel and I was staggered to see the extent of his travel: Noumea, China, Canada, the Seychelles, Europe, North America, Cyprus, Italy, New Zealand, South-East Asia, the USA, the UK, West Germany, France, New Zealand, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius, Fiji and Kiribati&mdash;and that was only in one year!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all seriousness, Mike has been a fantastic contributor to the Liberal Party&mdash;as a minister, as a backbencher and as a person. He has made an outstanding contribution to Australia. I personally will miss Mike, not only because of all that experience and all those contributions, but as a  person who is a very good friend and a source of very good and sustained advice. Michael, I wish you well in your future career. I am sure we have not seen the end of you.

You have been an intellectual force within the Labor Party, particularly as a minister covering portfolios such as Health, Community Services and Health, Trade Negotiations, Trade and Overseas Development, and Social Security. From a National Party point of view, your work in the areas of trade and trade negotiations has been of particular note. It is well known that you undertook the grinding work in preparation for the successful conclusion&mdash;eventually&mdash;of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That sort of work is never particularly glamorous. However, it is, and has been, fundamental to the final outcome that is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years during this process, the country was full of sceptics and those who sought to be cynical about the whole process. We on this side, particularly within the National Party, were constantly having to defend the process against those who said that an agreement such as GATT could never be successfully concluded and that Australia's position was increasing our vulnerability to the very unlevel playing fields which apply so frequently and so often to our disadvantage in the international trade arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass on to Dr Blewett the very best wishes of the parliamentary National Party for his work as high commissioner in London.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be those in this place who are not aware that the honourable member for Warringah was born and grew up in Baan Baa. Baan Baa is a thriving metropolis smack in the middle of my electorate of Gwydir. To this day, his father has a property just near Baan Baa. I will return to that point in a moment. Baan Baa was once an active and vital little town. Michael, I have to say that it has entered something of a gentle decline since you left. I trust that that will not happen to this place on your departure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael, Baan Baa was your early home. Your early education was undertaken there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You grew up with your sister Margaret, who is well known to me since she was my first campaign director.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Michael, you eventually left correspondence school and went to the Shore school in Sydney.

As so many of us have discovered in this place, our wives, or husbands as the case may be, are so often our greatest assets, unsung heroes though they may be. Michael, Robbie was soon to prove yours. The day after Michael and Robbie were married, the news broke that the then member for Warringah was to retire. Michael and Robbie were on honeymoon at the time. I trust that this news, if it did reach him, was not too much of a distraction. On your return, you stood for preselection with your wife beside you&mdash;you paid her a tribute here today, and I do so too&mdash;and won.

In fact, he actually gave them a little lecture. He said that there were not enough members of the caucus turning up to support the embattled minister for sport and that, in particular, it was necessary for ministers to come into the House and show that they had some support for her. I call upon all ministers to come in and to make sure that they show, at least in form, if not in reality, that they are prepared to put their names to what the Prime Minister has asked them to do. The Prime Minister, of course, is hanging on to this minister because of the personal affection in which he holds her.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has taken a long time. It has taken about three months since the Auditor-General reported to this parliament. It has taken about 50 questions, two or three matters of public importance, two or three censure motions and a lot of written questions from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, to which some derelict answers were given by the minister. But, last night, the minister was finally forced to go before the House of Representatives standing committee on the environment. The way she pulled it, to try to minimise the damage and the continuing fallout to the government over the sports rorts affair, was to announce to the media that she was going to go down to the House of Representatives committee inquiry. She had not been prepared to announce it in the House and she had not been prepared to give notice. She went without her staff and without producing the records. By announcing it first to the media she was hoping to catch the House of Representatives committee unawares, as she did last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time the minister was frightened that, if she did not pull some kind of stunt, the Australian Democrats would&mdash;and I hope they still will&mdash;set up an independent Senate inquiry backed by judicial officers to get to the bottom of the absolute mismanagement and total incompetence in the way in which she has administered her department and the way in which she has squandered without records $30 million of taxpayers' money.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unreported committee evidence</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members may not disclose in debate evidence taken by any committee of the House or the proceedings and reports of those committees which have not been reported to the House, unless disclosure or publication has been authorised by the House or, pursuant to the Parliamentary Papers Act, by the committee. Members have thus been prevented from referring to evidence not disclosed to the House or basing statements on matters disclosed to the committee. However, members have, from time to time, made statements on the activities of a committee by leave of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>I would submit that, if the honourable member is going to base his speech on references to evidence which has yet to be assessed by the committee&mdash;albeit evidence gathered in public but not yet reported to the House in the normal way in which committees report their evidence to the House, which is either within the document of the committee's report or as an attachment to it&mdash;that he is, in fact, in breach of quite a fundamental element of parliamentary practice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a minister who doled out $30 million worth of money. She received 2,000 applications and granted 726 of them. She says that, in deciding which ones are given grants and which ones are not, she has to take into account the number of youth in the area, the number of Aborigines in the area, the level of unemployment in the area, the level of migrant populations in the area, the demonstrated community need in the area, the evidence of financial commitments in relation to the application and a whole host of other criteria. But she does not need to produce one single document to assess 726 out of 2,800 applications which were approved because she has the magical whiteboard&mdash;a whiteboard on which she put all of the material and rubbed it out before the Auditor-General could come in and audit this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On talkback radio today competitions are being held as to who can give the best kind of excuse. They are holding competitions for people to ring in and to comment on the way in which this minister has appropriated $30 million off her whiteboard. People have been ringing in and making suggestions. One example was about children who turn up to school without their homework. When they are asked by their teacher, `Where is your homework?', the answer is, `I left it on the whiteboard at home'. Another example concerned people who have not put in their tax returns. The tax commissioner comes to them and says, `Why haven't you filed your tax returns?' and they reply, `I wrote them up on the whiteboard'. Or they are asked, `Where is the evidence of your deductions; where is the verification?'; and the reply is, `Trevor Boucher, it is all on the whiteboard and it has been rubbed out'. This is the way in which the Keating government administers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can honourable members believe it? We have all these wonderful speeches about how the government has internationalised the economy, how it has got sophisticated financial management and all of these things, but what we now know is that a person only needs three things to administer a taxpayer funded program: a whiteboard, a textacolour and a rubber&mdash;especially the rubber, because the rubber is very important to take the details off before the auditor comes in. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can just imagine the Treasurer coming in to present his budget. He is asked, `Treasurer, where are the budget papers?'. I suppose he will say, `They're on the whiteboard. There are no budget papers this year. It has all been put up on the whiteboard. It has all been destroyed before the auditor can come in, before the FOI processes can take place, before the parliament can subpoena the documents and before the House of Representatives can call for the documents'. This is a Mr Squiggle method of administration. If people wanted a grant, they sent a squiggle off to the minister. She put the squiggle up on the whiteboard and she could turn it into a $200,000 grant. That is a Mr Squiggle-type application. And the squiggle that really moved an organisation up the whiteboard was if there was a squiggle stating `ALP marginal' somewhere in the application. If it had `ALP marginal' on it, the organisation went right up to the top of the whiteboard and it had a two to one chance of getting money out of this minister. We now have a system where this minister legitimately claims that there is no documentation which shows the decision making in relation to why some applications were granted and others were not because it has all been erased; it has all gone off the whiteboard. How could she deliberate on 2,800 applications, classify them according to 12 columns, put them all up on the whiteboard 100 at a time and make a decision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press of this country want to film that whiteboard tonight. It is probably as big as a tennis court to make sure that it can fit all of these entries and applications onto it. But the minister will not even let the press in to look at the whiteboard. She will not let them take a film of the magical mystery whiteboard. When she was asked last night, `How could you possibly do all of this on a whiteboard?'&mdash;that is, $30 million worth with 12 entries in relation to yours, mine and every Australian's taxes all rubbed out&mdash;she said, `Oh, it was a big whiteboard. It enabled me to have them all up there 100 at a time'. We do not consider that proper administration and neither does the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole affair started when the Auditor-General tried to audit this program to make sure that it was complying with guidelines, that it was being done fairly and that there was no political bias. The finding of the Auditor-General reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of an effective audit trail means ANAO cannot report to Parliament whether or not expenditure on the program represents value for money in achieving the program objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>There was no audit trail because this minister had figured out a way of making decisions, having money and not having any records that could be scrutinised by an auditor. If people from a private company make financial decisions and then have to be audited, does the minister think they turn up with a whiteboard? Does the minister think an auditor would say to a private company, `Yes, you've got a clean bill of health, Mr Skase, because we can't find any documents; it was all on a whiteboard that has now been erased.'? Of course he would not. If directors were making decisions and expending shareholders' funds but did not have documents to prove it to an auditor, they would be guilty of an offence. Why should the standard be any less for a minister of the Crown dealing with taxpayers' money than it is for a company director dealing with shareholders' funds? Why should there be one standard for the company directors of Australia and another for the Labor Party ministers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens when representatives of the department of labour and industry come to a small business employing people and ask, `Where are your Workcare records'? It is no excuse to say, `It was all on the whiteboard'. What happens if they ask, `Where are your training guarantee levies? Where are your FBT claims? Where are your payroll deductions? Where are the mechanics and the working documents that explain how all of this took place and how the decisions were made'? A person cannot turn around to the tax authorities and say, `I'm sorry. It was all on the whiteboard. There is no documentation. I can't tell you how the decisions were made, who was involved or how much money was spent because it has all been rubbed out'. People are not allowed to do that. The government says that there is a law against it. People are committing an offence if they do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should it be any different for a minister who has $30 million worth of taxpayers' money? Why should a minister be able to say in an arrogant way to the people of Australia, `I am a friend of the Prime Minister, so I am not required to account; I am a friend of the Prime Minister, who, on political grounds, will vote with me every time. So it does not matter what I do.'? Why should a minister be able to claim, against all the odds, that personal privilege which comes from being in the royal family of the Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party backbench knows this. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reported yesterday that most of the backbench concedes that any other minister would have gone before now, but this minister gets special dispensation because she is part of the royal family and part of the rich in crowd in Canberra. She does not have to account for the money. She can have adverse audits. She can fail to explain. She can be pulled through a House of Representatives committee, the parliament, the press and public ridicule in relation to her administration. She has one person standing behind her who is up to his armpits in this&mdash;all of the hopeless administration, all of the evasion of responsibility, all of the political corruption and all of the buying of votes. It is the Prime Minister who stands behind this minister and who excuses her on the basis of her personal friendship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing has been absolutely proven throughout this whole affair: the Auditor-General has been entirely vindicated on every point against this minister. The minister has been huffing and puffing with the Auditor-General. We know that the government has been trying to run down his office. We know that the Australian Labor Party has a lease which enables it to rip money out of him and then not reimburse him for the rent. We know that the Australian Labor Party would love to see this Auditor-General run down in relation to his resources and staff. He is one of the few checks and balances that stand between a government that has grown fat, tired, lazy and incompetent and the people of Australia, who deserve public accountability. They give the government the taxes that make it possible for it to delve out money on the basis of calculations done on the back of whiteboards. The Auditor-General is one of the people who stand between this minister getting away with easy money schemes and vote buying exercises such as this and public accountability. We will be supporting the Auditor-General. He has been entirely vindicated in this matter. But there is one person who has been entirely condemned, ridiculed and totally exposed: it is the minister for sport. She is dragging down not only herself; she is also dragging each and every one of the ministry and each and every one of the backbench down with her. </PARA>

There has been no proven political bias, no fraud, no suggestion of any minister personally benefiting from the expenditure, no impropriety and no withholding of documents.

Those opposite are interested in only one thing, and that is politics. That has been clearly exposed today. We discussed this for 5 1/2 hours last night. I answered all the questions of those opposite, but they still came in today and asked exactly the same questions. They introduced an MPI and gave exactly the same speech as has been delivered in parliament over and over again. It had little factual information and was full of personal abuse. Whenever those opposite cannot find any facts, they reduce to personal abuse. I do not intend to get into that. I intend to stick very much to this subject and go through the points of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has consistently accused me of fraud. The Auditor-General did not, of course. No-one else in the community has. But those opposite throw their mud around the place and hope some of it will stick. I object to any accusation of fraud in this program. The Auditor-General made it very clear that there was no finding of fraud. The only carcass in this place is that of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). This program is beneficial to the community and, before anyone gets the money, the project must be completed. Documentation proving that the project has been completed or is in the process of being completed must be shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout this debate the opposition has vilified so many good, worthwhile community groups around this nation. For any grant over $50,000 community groups have had to make their own contribution. Whether it be from fundraising or local or state government funds, they have made contributions. This opposition has cast a cloud over all of those good Australian citizens who have devoted years of their lives raising these funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition has said outside this parliament that this program is squandering taxpayers' money. What absolute hypocrisy on his part. At the same time as the Leader of the Opposition is taking the high moral ground and talking about the squandering of taxpayers' money, he has his own backbench writing me letters saying, `Please, can I have some more money for my programs? Even if that program does not exist, give me some more money from some other pot of money'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As late as yesterday I had another letter from an opposition member.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night for 5 1/2 hours I answered over 320 questions from the opposition. Those opposite do not like the fact that the answers just do not suit them. The answers do not suit them, not on the question of propriety, and not on the question of ministerial responsibility, but on the question of only one thing&mdash;politics, which is what this whole debate comes down to. It is simply about politics. The opposition believes that this program particularly benefited seats that were not theirs. As I have said in this parliament many times, this program has been based on need. It has been based on areas which needed community facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Liberal seats needed those facilities and they got them. I am sure that the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) knows about some in particular. Many National Party seats received funding because they needed community facilities. Some Labor Party seats received grants because they needed facilities. The grants were based on need. That material was documented. As I explained to the parliamentary committee last night, there are 104 filing cabinets of information on this. I went through the selection criteria in great detail and the needs basis of funding. This program has benefited many Australians. Rather than opposition members getting up here and continually vilifying this program, it would do the community a great deal of good if they tempered some of that by outlining the value of these programs in their own electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all this debate, which has gone on for months, we have come down to what this is fundamentally all about&mdash;politics. The government has always known that. It is about time the rest of the community started to realise that the opposition's pursuit of this matter is purely a political witch-hunt devoted only to making a political point. Opposition members put themselves up on the high moral ground. When I appear before the committee and answer every single one of their questions on this program, what do they do? They bring it on today and ask exactly the same questions, and then they run a matter of public importance, which is exactly the same as it has been every day in this parliament. Those opposite produce no new information. Clearly, I have demonstrated at every opportunity in this debate that there is no fraud in the program. The program is delivering much needed community facilities. Always we see total hypocrisy displayed by opposition members, who send me their begging letters saying, `Please can my constituents have some more of that money?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also said that I am prepared to accept the recommendations of the Auditor-General regarding this program. I have taken very seriously his comments on the program. I said last night and I will say again that we take his recommendations seriously and we will implement them. The changes that I have discussed with the secretary in relation to this program concern redesigning the application form and information provided to applicants, issuing guidelines to departments on the broad allocation of funds by states and requiring broad geographic coverage, asking my department to analyse applications and provide recommendations, and providing reasons for instances where I depart from the recommendations. This obviously shows that I am very serious about the Auditor-General's comments and I intend to apply them. At the moment, I will be applying to the existing program what recommendations are relevant&mdash;as I will to the new program, if there is one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we established this program we looked at the balance between administration and program delivery. We spent about one per cent of the program money on bureaucratic and administrative support. On balance, and with the information the Auditor-General gave, that was not enough. My motivation in that regard was purely to give as much money as possible to the community.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the Auditor-General's view is that we should spend more on administration. When members of the opposition actually get around to outlining their policies they always start by attacking the bureaucracy. The opposition always says that it wants smaller government and fewer bureaucrats. But then the hypocrites stand up and say, `But in this program we want a whole army of bureaucrats'. That would be of great benefit to my electorate here in Canberra. I find it very hypocritical of the opposition to say, `We want smaller government and fewer bureaucrats, but with this program everything is different; we want a much higher percentage of program money devoted to administration'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this whole debate I have never heard from the opposition an estimate of what that percentage should be. Currently it is one per cent. Does the opposition want it to be 10 per cent or 20 per cent? Opposition members consistently present a point of view that is critical of programs but never give any constructive views about how programs can be reformed; nor do they ever present any serious alternative policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The closest we have come to that is the view of the shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson), about how a program such as this could be run. We have heard in this parliament that his idea is to give each member of parliament a certain sum of money to distribute in whatever way they like. I appreciate comments from the Auditor-General on this proposal because we have not heard anything about any guidelines. We have not heard anything about any controls. We have not heard anything about any criteria of assessment. All we have heard is that the bagman for the Liberal Party would hand out a certain amount of money to each electorate in Australia. It will be very interesting to watch the development of that policy and very interesting to hear the Auditor-General's views on that so-called policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I revert to the point where I started. This whole debate today is evidence of what this matter is really about: politics. It started as politics and it will finish as politics. It is about time that members of the opposition stopped their pretentious mumblings about ministerial responsibilities and the rights of the Auditor-General and faced up to what this is all about. It is purely politics. </PARA>

<PARA>On this occasion we do not believe that the minister has maintained a sufficiently high standard of documentation.

Minister, why will you not answer one simple question: why did you choose application A over application B? That is still the question that we have not had answered in this place for three months. There is no point talking about 300 questions last night, MPIs and censure motions. Why do you not tell us what it was? You have maintained all the way through, minister, that what you are talking about here is needs-based applications. But just last night, out of interest, you also mentioned that you put them into the categories of states and that notional amounts had been allocated. Minister, will you please tell us what those notional amounts were for the states and also what the notional amounts were for the regional areas? Last night we went from a purely needs-based program to a program that all of a sudden has notional amounts for states and also notional amounts for regional centres. You have not answered to anyone's satisfaction why you made those decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that the attendant was handing out membership forms for Actors Equity&mdash;opposition members need them. The opposition can feel quite passionate about the sports grants program. After all, the opposition gave a guarantee before the last election that if it were elected the program would be axed. The opposition has a vested interest in discrediting the whole program by claiming that the funds were distributed in a politically biased way. The opposition often quotes from the Auditor-General's report, but let us have a look at what it says on page 11:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrity of the selection process has been questioned with the Opposition alleging party political bias. The Opposition has frequently complained that marginal Government held seats have received a disproportionate percentage of the funds allocated.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps that was during the phone call that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) had with the Auditor-General of which, of course, the Auditor-General has no record. The Auditor-General's report No. 9 1993 specifically states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence did not demonstrate one way or the other that projects were approved on party political grounds.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition is very sensitive about corruption and accountability. After all, it was the coalition government of New South Wales that gave us the Eastern Creek racetrack. This project was initially costed at $4 million. It now owes the people of New South Wales $120 million and the track does not provide a single facility for any one of the groups identified in the program of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Obviously, a couple of young puppies on the opposition bench think they can prove what the Auditor-General cannot prove with an audit that cost in excess of $200,000, which, I might add, contains a significant number of errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite use the old conservative trick&mdash;we all know it&mdash;say something often enough and some people will start to believe it; say it more often and they will believe it themselves. This whole charade is a hypocritical attempt at cheap political point scoring through deliberate deception to deflect attention from having to admit that these programs have been enormously successful; have generated employment for hundreds of people; and have given recognition to the mighty efforts of the dedicated and committed volunteers who give so much to their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the best way to demonstrate that political bias did not exist is to talk about the grants that went to my own electorate&mdash;the electorate of Paterson that was identified before the 1993 election as `the most marginal electorate in Australia'. That is where one would expect to find pork-barrelling running riot. What do we find? We find that $15,000 went to a girl guide association for renovating a building in a camp that serves the whole of the Hunter region. It does not serve just one little guide troop but the whole region. That is the story of many of these grants and the distorted interpretation that has been placed on them. They are not about individual electorates; they are about serving the needs of the youth of an area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gloucester district tennis club&mdash;I get 23 per cent of the vote from that district and it has never had a Labor representative since Federation&mdash;got $25,125 for a synthetic surface for its tennis courts. I am pleased to say that the young tennis players of this small rural community now have the same opportunity to learn tennis skills as some of their wealthier city cousins have. I do not know how their parents vote. I do not know how they will continue to vote. The Gloucester Youth Committee got $7,000. It is not a lot of money, but it is all the committee asked for. It is helping to provide a service for the youth of that community. Rural youth have the same needs as city youth do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fingal Bay, where the sports and recreation club got $6,590 for sun shades for the bowling green, is in a rapid growth area. The local government is having difficulty providing infrastructure. Fingal Bay has a lot of retirees and a lot of young families. It has a definite need, as was identified in its application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port Stephens Council, one of the fastest growth areas in Australia, was successful in getting a grant of $30,000 for wheelchair access for disabled people to the water at Little Beach. How symbolic, in the international year of the disabled, that this minister should support such a grant! It is only a small part of the total cost of that project. Yet, if we listen to those opposite&mdash;I notice that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is suddenly short of supporters, even his seconder has gone&mdash;they say that this was politically selective. What nonsense!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently had the pleasure of being at the first exhibition held in the Myall Community Arts and Craft Centre. The centre got $26,000. It matched the grant dollar for dollar and its facility has been added on to the local government community centre that was funded under the local government capital works program. This group ran a shop, had street stalls and carried out many fundraising activities to service the need in that community. I have no idea how people in that area vote. I do not want to know that. All I know is that they are industrious and honest and I had the greatest pleasure in supporting the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The East Maitland cricket club received $49,000 for practice nets on an oval that was to be built by the New South Wales state government but has not been built. It is in a major growth area where there are lots of young families. That club, afraid it might lose that grant, has approached the Maitland City Council. The Maitland City Council has said that it will support the club; it identified the need, as did the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last grant that came to my electorate was the biggest one of all&mdash;$50,000 went to Dungog Shire Council for a swimming pool at Clarence Town. Clarence Town is a small rural town&mdash;a low socioeconomic area, lots of kids, no public transport and high youth unemployment.

<PARA>This is a motion to amend standing orders. It deals principally with handling legislation and structuring the proposal for a main committee. It deals with some matters relating to disorder, some matters relating to the sitting program and program of business, and some matters relating to the election of a deputy speaker. I will move two other motions later in the day&mdash;one will change sessional orders in relation to question time and the other will set in place a procedure to permit you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, to continue in office as Deputy Speaker without a fresh election being required. I intend to speak only to the motion which I have moved. I will briefly speak to the other motions during the afternoon and evening as they come forward for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that you would be happy with this procedure, as I think any of the other presiding officers would be&mdash;that, whereas there is only one motion before the House, if honourable members making a contribution wish to canvass all three, that certainly would be acceptable to the government.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Firstly, because I might forget in the hurly-burly of discussion, I want to thank the clerks, particularly Mr Barlin, for the enormous work they have done in preparing what is a virtual total restructuring of standing orders in order to be able to cope with the very substantial changes, particularly those that are associated with establishing a main committee. It may be that, in the course of their consideration of this, the government's consideration and, ultimately, the House's consideration of it, we will find that there are some errors or some unworkable elements to it. If that is the case, of course, it will always be open to us to deal with that when the occasion arises and it becomes obvious to us that changes are needed. But I can attest to the fact that every care has been exercised in getting these standing orders together in a way that will make that main committee workable. I congratulate the clerks on their diligent work in doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are changes to standing orders and, therefore, they will sit in standing orders until the government at some time in the future and a House at some time in the future decides to change them. Other changes to standing orders or sessional orders will last only for the period of the experiment, as far as question time is concerned; that is, to the middle of this year when the matter will be considered again by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters entailed in this first motion, which I have referred to. The first is the appointment of a deputy speaker and a second deputy speaker. The second deputy speaker will be drawn from the ranks of the non-government members of the chamber. I think this is an important step. It has been a matter of some debate over time&mdash;not by the committee that considered these proposals&mdash;that there ought to be, in the processes of election of Speaker, more bipartisanship than there has been hitherto, and perhaps even that an independent Speaker ought to be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many arguments for and against that particular proposition. But I certainly believe that the effect of the election of a second deputy speaker under these terms and its enshrining in standing orders will create a situation where there will be more of a sense&mdash;even more than is simply provided for by the bipartisan nature of the appointment of temporary chairpersons&mdash;of the essentially independent or bipartisan nature of the person who is the presiding officer. I think that over time we will find that what seems like quite a small advance in fact becomes quite a major advance in the handling of business in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this motion there are also matters dealing with hours of sitting. Those hours of sitting are virtually the same as were handed forth by Dr Blewett's committee&mdash;not entirely the same but virtually the same. They still permit party meetings, which people are anxious to sustain, for Mondays and Tuesdays. But the main feature of them that was noteworthy to all is that they have us rising on three days at 8.00 p.m. and on the fourth day at 6.00 p.m., the view being that this will lead to more civilised hours for members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not an optimist in that regard, I have to say. I suspect that these evenings will be filled very quickly and that we will have committees meeting in that time and being able to meet in that way at some leisure, unpressed by quorums and divisions. Once committee chairmen discover that, they will be even more ambitious for the evening meeting. Some of them will be throttled by their colleagues. I am aware of the fact that this has been an extremely popular reform on both sides of the House. There has been a great deal of concern on both sides of the House about the absurd hours that we keep&mdash;not as absurd a set of hours as we used to keep; as I recollect, when I came here it was a bit more frequently the case that the 11 o'clock rule was suspended&mdash;and certainly not the absurd hours as are sat in state parliaments. But if it sustains members' health and good commonsense in the course of debate, then I think that will be all to the good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision here for changes to processes on disorder, again recommended by the Blewett committee, which allows the Speaker the capacity to discipline recalcitrant members of the parliament by sin-binning them for a period of one hour, and then there is a series of consequent changes in regard to other penalties. If all these changes add up to a situation where some of the sense of the parliamentary tradition of the place is effectively restored, then that will be all to the good, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must confess&mdash;I am not laying blame on the opposition in this regard; the government must share an element of blame itself&mdash;that this parliament operates a long way from the jealous guardian of traditions which existed in the parliament when I first came here and which existed prior to that in the time my father was a member of parliament. Those two periods are the only periods of which I have either direct knowledge or pretty good vicarious knowledge of how proceedings went. I think we saw an example of it here today when what were pretty tough-minded standing orders and parliamentary practices of hundreds of years standing&mdash;we took them from the Westminster system and they related to the way in which House committee proceedings have been regarded as sacrosanct and not for discussion in the House until the committee has reported; it was done for convenience, and I think it was convenient in order to encourage debate to proceed&mdash;were effectively just simply stood aside. In the conduct of question time it has been necessary for other processes to be set aside, including the quite strict standing orders relating to the nature of questions&mdash;whether or not they canvass information and all the other standing orders relating to them&mdash;and the nature of answers in relation to relevance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a substantial step back from a strict observance of the way in which standing orders operate. We do not have to get fixated with rules and we do not have to make gods of rules, but in a chamber which is supposed to be as dignified as well as robust as this one is, those are time honoured traditions of debate. It would be very useful if the Speakers and presiding officers got themselves into a position where they felt they were readily able to enforce the traditions of the place more effectively than has been the capacity of presiding officers of late. This might help that. I am not sure whether it will, but it might. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These standing orders contain a proposition dealing with the routine of business associated with the changed timetables. The most noteworthy feature of the routine of business is the shifting of the opportunity to deal with private members business from Thursday mornings to a substantial proportion of the Monday sitting. That is noteworthy only in the sense that, instead of its being concluded by question time, it will be broken by question time, given the change to the time at which question time is held to 3 o'clock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hope of the government in shifting question time to 3 o'clock is that it will enable, over the period of the lunch hour, much more business to be transacted by members of parliament without the pressure of immediately having to meet  at 2 o'clock. Much business is transacted by members of parliament during the lunch hour. For example, committee meetings are held at this time. An enormous amount of entertainment activity occurs, with constituents entertaining members and with persons providing information essential to the effective activities of members of parliament. In the tasks that they have before them, ministers frequently have a need for entertainment at lunchtime, usually business lunches. The 3 o'clock start for question time will remove some of the pressure that is imposed on them by a 2 o'clock start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, question time has been bumped all over the place. It has been held in the morning, at 2.15 p.m. and at 2 p.m. This is just yet another change of the time at which question time is held to 3 o'clock. We will see whether it is any better than the experiences that have been had with question time in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bulk of the material here deals with the main committee, which is highly experimental and will be difficult to organise. The standing orders make it as simple as possible, with a quorum effectively requiring in place only a chairperson, one government member and one non-government member. The use of that description is deliberate. There is not an anticipation, necessarily, that there will be ministers or frontbenchers in the main committee. There is an assumption, of course, that this would usually be the case, but it is not necessarily maintained that it inevitably be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter we are going to have to look at is the whipping arrangements. It will be necessary for us to expand the number of whips, both on the government side and on the opposition side. Effectively, the main committee is going to have to be a whips-run chamber to a very large extent. There will be a requirement for more whips, from both sides of the House, to effectively perform that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the main committee is to work as envisaged by the Blewett committee and by the government, it ought to have before it legislation which is effectively non-controversial but which does require a bit of detailed attention from the House, in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation. One would hope that simply because legislation would be being considered on a non-controversial basis it would not necessarily be the case that it would not be amended. There should be opportunities for members on both sides of the House to put forward amendments. If they become matters of disagreement, the suggestion is that that disagreement has to be reported to the House, to the main chamber, where consideration will then be given by the main chamber in the form of a vote on those particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also intended that this informal mode of operation should not extend to ready tolerance of disorder. The standing orders are devised in such a way that any of the people in the main committee, but particularly the Presiding Officer, can shut the main committee down and take the matter back to the chamber for that disorder to be resolved. Hopefully, that is not a situation which will ever be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change that all these new arrangements impose on our normal operations will require an earlier tabling of explanatory memoranda. An explanatory memorandum will have to come forward at the first reading of a bill&mdash;not at its second reading, the time at which that normally happens&mdash;when that bill is headed off to the main committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important series of changes. Having looked at the comments made by members on both sides of the House, I know that the motion I have moved is largely uncontroversial and I hope that it can be dispatched relatively speedily. It would be my intention to try to finish debating this motion at about 6.00 p.m. and then to move the motion relating to changes to question time so that debate on that can continue after the suspension for dinner. As was indicated, and I am sure you heard this, Mr Deputy Speaker, there was a willingness to tolerate a pretty broad ranging discussion on all of these matters for the convenience of members to have a chance to have a go at them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you and your colleagues in the chair for your indication that you will allow a wide ranging debate on the three motions which are to be presented to the House. The House will already be aware of the broad nature of the opposition's attitude to these changes. We have very serious reservations about the changes that are proposed to question time, and the major reasons for that opposition have already been explained. They relate to the reduced accountability of ministers, particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see the changes as being tailor-made to suit the political convenience of the Prime Minister. We regard anything that breaks a 93-year tradition of the Australian parliament of ministers&mdash;including of Prime Minister and Treasurer&mdash;being answerable to the parliament on every day that the parliament sits as being a serious reduction in the authority of this parliament. Our basic principle is that changes made to parliamentary procedures should enhance the power of the legislature over the executive, not the power of the executive over the legislature. If we extract the Prime Minister and the Treasurer from the daily sittings of a parliament that meets, on average, 60 or 70 days a year and cut that in half, there can be no argument&mdash;stripping all sophistry aside&mdash;that we are in fact reducing the power of the legislature over the executive. That is alien to our system of government and is, I think, very regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly enough, the valedictory session that we had earlier this afternoon provided some valuable insights to the issue that we are now debating. The honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) made a particularly valuable contribution to that debate when he spoke of the need&mdash;as did the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar)&mdash;for attitudinal changes by people in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people on both sides of this parliament have a great respect for this institution. Some are less enthusiastic about it, but a lot care about it a great deal. I am certainly one of those people, and I know that my friend and colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) is one also, as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker. There are many such people on the other side of the House, including the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and, in his own way, the Prime Minister. I am genuinely worried about the decline in public esteem for the parliament. All of us share some of the blame for that. We take our share of the blame. The government must take its share of the blame. A lot has to do with the attitude of two people, one of whom is the Prime Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cite two instances, one that occurred in the early 1960s when the former Prime Minister Mr Menzies required the then Attorney-General, who later became a Speaker, to withdraw a misleading remark he had made about a flag in another country. An incident that I recall happening&mdash;I do not mention it to embarrass anybody in the chamber at the present time&mdash;was when the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke required a member of his ministry, who is no longer in the ministry, to withdraw a remark about a member of the opposition frontbench which he clearly regarded as being offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a great deal lies within the capacity of the Prime Minister of the day. Whoever is in power is the dominant political personality. When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister of this country he dominated question time. When Menzies was Prime Minister he dominated question time. I was here for 18 months while Whitlam was Prime Minister, and he dominated question time for most of the period, despite the parlous political bleeding of his government at that moment in Australian history. Of course, the present Prime Minister dominates question time. It is the nature of the beast&mdash;the beast being question time, not the individual Prime Minister. A lot lies within the capacity and the influence of the Prime Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever comes out of these changes, I earnestly hope that there is a desire by the present Prime Minister and those behind him to recognise that the ideal to which the Australian public probably aspires is a question time which is vigorous and is characteristically Australian. We cannot hope to have a question time in Australia which is like question time in the House of Commons, because we are different people. We may have the same Westminster system, but we have our own version of it. It is a bit like saying that we both speak English but we speak it with an Australian accent and use Australian idioms. The same thing applies for our parliamentary institution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some Australian characteristics of parliamentary exchanges that I would hate to see disappear. I would hate to see a sombre, unenthusiastic question time lacking vigour, lacking colour and, on occasions, lacking very vigorous language. Basically, I think people are now saying that it has gone a bit too far in the other direction and we have to try to get the pendulum back into the middle. By all means, let us have some robust exchanges, but they should not go on for too long, they should not be trivial and they should not be stupid. By working together we could do that without changing the rules. It would be very easy. We could do more to clean up question time and raise its repute in the eyes of the Australian community if the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) agreed that we were going to alter the way in which we conduct ourselves. Regrettably, the nature of adversarial politics in Australia has precluded that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that there has been a steady deterioration in the quality of question time. Fewer questions are asked now than were asked 10 years ago when Mr Hawke was Prime Minister. Fewer questions were asked during the Hawke period than were asked during the Fraser period. Fewer questions were asked during the Fraser period than were asked during earlier periods. A lot of these things are our own responsibility, and they lie within our own capacity to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have said that we are very unhappy with the proposed changes to question time, and I repeat it today. Obviously we will oppose those changes, but because of the government's numbers they will come into effect. I hope the government is serious about reviewing the operation of question time. I am glad to see the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) nodding to indicate that the government is serious about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are not opposed to the idea of more rational sitting hours, I wonder about the sense of the House getting up at 8 o'clock on Monday and Tuesday nights. I can see the sense of the House getting up at 8 o'clock on Wednesday night, and I can certainly see what is behind it getting up at 6 o'clock on Thursday night. But on Monday and Tuesday nights we could well have resolved to sit from 2 o'clock in the afternoon to 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night. This is what the opposition wanted. We put it to the honourable member for Bonython but, unfortunately, the government decided that it wants to start at 12.30 p.m. I think that in practice it will prove to be inconvenient for both the cabinet and the opposition executive. The idea that we can get through a party meeting and get ready for the resumption of parliament at 12.30 p.m. rather than at 2 o'clock might turn out to be rather misplaced. I hope the government retains an open mind about that matter, but I accept that it has taken that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have long held the view that this parliament should sit more frequently. I think many of the problems that have arisen and many of the differences that we have about such things as the rostering of ministers would be solved if we sat more frequently. I am not arguing that we should sit as frequently as the House of Commons, because it deals with a whole range of domestic and international political matters in Britain, whereas this country is a federation and we do not deal with matters that are within the purview of state governments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government's changes to the sessional sitting times are quite praiseworthy. It is sensible to start at the beginning of February rather than halfway through February. I have always thought that the Christmas recess was a bit too long. If we understood that, on occasion, while parliament was sitting it would be permissible and acceptable for people to be overseas more extensively than they are now, we might lose our reluctance to have the parliament sit for a longer period. I have no problem with starting in February. I think we could even improve the sessional sitting times a bit more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other items that are under consideration relate to the establishment of a second chamber. Our attitude is basically to give it a go.

He talked about a roster that would have allowed us to require the attendance of a minister specifically for questioning on a day on which he or she was not rostered. We did not get that; we got a full-blooded roster system. We talked about having a genuine guarantee of an extended question time.

It is not too hard to have a second chamber but it is too hard to give us a guarantee of a miserable 14 questions, which is two fewer than the average of the Fraser years and two fewer than what Hawke was giving us at the beginning of his period of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider that we now have 148 members in the House and we had only 75 in the late 1940s, we see how question time has continued to decline in significance. I am very disappointed about that. At no stage has the government taken our views into account. I accept that the honourable member for Bonython may have wanted to do so, but he suffered the same fate as Mr Speaker&mdash;a kick up the backside from the Prime Minister, who has found that some of his ideas do not suit his political convenience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in a sense, I finish where I started. It all gets back ultimately to those who control this place&mdash;the government of the day. The person who controls the government, certainly this government, is the Prime Minister, because he keeps telling us how he has got everybody in his pocket and how he runs everything to suit his own convenience. If we really want to improve the repute of this parliament in the community, I think there has to be a cultural change, particularly on his part. If it were to occur, I can, on behalf of the opposition, assure honourable members that it would be very warmly reciprocated. </PARA>

I acknowledge some of the points he made in his contribution. I would like to talk about a few things that I think are important in this discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, I would like to make the comment that all of the changes we are putting in are basically on trial. Although we are making changes to the standing orders in some places and introducing sessional orders in other places, I do not think by any stretch of the imagination that, if the things we are changing in the standing orders are totally unworkable or fail to achieve what they set out to achieve, they are locked in concrete and will not be able to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that these new measures are quite a radical change to the format of this place. They seek to address some of the more fundamental questions that have been raised not just by opposition members most vociferously, but also by government members about the procedures in this place and the opportunities for honourable members, particularly backbenchers, to participate fully in the processes and the workings of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should enter this debate with the clear knowledge that, although the government has accepted some of the major points in the very excellent report of the procedure committee chaired by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), all of the changes that are being put into place will be very much on trial. If things do not work&mdash;particularly the change regarding the main committee, which is quite a radical change&mdash;we will need to look at them. I believe we should give all the changes a go. They are very much a positive change for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that in mind, I would like to comment on the changes to question time. The majority report of the procedure committee recommended that question time be at 3.30 p.m. At the time this report was tabled, a number of opposition members raised some concerns because, with question time being at 3.30 p.m. and the MPI following that, it was going to impact on the capacity to have question time and the MPI debate featured on the main news that night. The government has responded to that concern and has amended that recommendation and put question time in its proposed program at 3 o'clock, which I think takes account of the concerns expressed by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The other question that was raised by the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Bennelong, referred to the setting of a minimum number of questions. The government has said that it will seek to introduce, not in the standing orders, a minimum number of 14 questions. The opposition is saying, `But it is not in the standing orders. There is no guarantee in the standing orders that we get a minimum number of questions'. We need to have a look at the other side of the coin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat here in question time on Tuesday, I think, and measured the amount of time that the opposition actually wasted in question time by taking frivolous points of order and by point scoring. There were some 7 1/2 minutes wasted during question time by the taking of points of order, which is a deliberate tactic to disrupt ministers and break up the flow of question time. If opposition members want to make sure they get their minimum number of questions in question time, then they need also to look at themselves and at the amount of time they waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that in the last session of parliament answers to questions went on for too long. We were not getting sufficient questions asked and answers given in question time because some ministers spoke for too long. The current Speaker has tried to ensure that answers are not too lengthy, and there has been a considerable improvement in the length of ministers' answers. If we could now get a reduction in the frivolous points of order and point scoring from the opposition during question time, we may well be able to achieve the minimum of 14, 16 or even&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;18 questions in question time. The continual interjecting, point scoring and points of order in question time all waste time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members cannot have it both ways. If they want to have questions asked and answers given in question time, then they should not waste so much of question time with their antics. We, as government members, need to make sure that ministers are not taking too long with their answers and opposition members also need to look at their performance in question time. Then maybe we will achieve that magic figure that everyone seems to be hanging out for of 16 questions per question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a backbencher, I am particularly interested in the improved opportunities that I believe will exist in this process for backbenchers to contribute more in this place. I take my role as a member of parliament very seriously indeed. I believe I have a responsibility in this place not just to be a member of the government, not just to represent the Labor Party, but to effectively represent my constituents. I can only do that by getting opportunities to participate in debates on legislation, private members business and on reports that are tabled by committees of this place, government authorities, departments or semi-government authorities&mdash;which are very important matters that we spend so little time on in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the very important changes that are being introduced relates to the creation of a second chamber. That will give backbenchers a much greater opportunity to participate in debates and to put forward the concerns of their constituents. The new hours that will apply in this chamber mean a reduced amount of time to discuss committee reports. However, new standing order 270, which refers to the main committee, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)orders of the day for the resumption of debate on motions moved in connection with committee and delegation reports may be referred for debate.</PARA>
<PARA>I will be urging the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) to ensure that sufficient time is given each day in the program of the main committee for debates on committee reports, delegation reports and departmental annual reports, et cetera. I believe an important part of the work of this parliament is to scrutinise the work of government departments and semi-government authorities and to consider in detail the recommendations of parliamentary committees. I look forward to the increased opportunity that backbenchers will have, through the operations of the second chamber&mdash;the main committee&mdash;to participate in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and most crucial thing that I hope will come out of the formation of the main committee is that it will lead to the virtual end of the guillotine process. The operation of a second chamber will enable us to free up government business in this chamber for those important issues and pieces of legislation about which there is some difference of opinion or controversy and about which many people will wish to express their points of view for or against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen non-controversial legislation appear on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. Thankfully, I have not had to talk on legislation such as the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill and the Deer Velvet Levy Bill. I do not think legislation like that raises a lot of heat or angst in this chamber. It would be valuable to have those debates shifted to the second chamber so that legislation dealing with issues of major national importance, such as native title rights, social security, pensions or things affecting our veterans, can be debated without time pressures. When we have to get many bills passed in a short time and the guillotine is imposed, we get only an hour or two hours to debate major bills as we also have to debate all the other minor bills. Freeing this chamber of the minor bills will allow those honourable members who have something important to contribute to those debates&mdash;even if they are not controversial&mdash;to get the time to do so in the second chamber. Much more time will then be available in this chamber to allow us to talk about the really significant matters of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very hopeful that the operation of the second chamber or main committee will lead to our not having a crush of bills at the end of session nor the need for the guillotine to be imposed, with the frustration that that provides for not only the opposition but also government backbenchers, who get frustrated at the fact that they have very limited scope to talk about issues that may be of great importance to them or their electorates. I believe that that is a major and significant achievement that will flow from the formation of the main committee, or second chamber. It is something that we should all be pleased about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important matter that we have been discussing in relation to the main committee is the election of a second Deputy Speaker. That recommendation, contained in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>, has been adopted by the government. It reinforces the principle that the positions of the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker are supposed to be independent. Having two deputy speakers, one from the government side and one from the opposition side, reinforces that independence. That is also something to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that I would like to talk about briefly is question time. There has been some disagreement and argument about the rostering of ministers. I am absolutely amazed at the opposition's allegation that somehow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is seeking to run away from question time and avoid scrutiny by rostering himself on for only two days a week. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Prime Minister is certainly not seeking to avoid being scrutinised by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, there is little doubt that so much of how this place functions depends on the person who is in the position that you now occupy. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, it is true that, above all, two people determine the nature and character of the parliament: the Speaker, or the person who sits in the chair; and the Prime Minister. More than anything else, the effectiveness and, I guess, ability of people to be able to express a point of view and engage in rational debate depends upon their behaviour and the way in which they interpret the standing orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of a committee into parliamentary procedure, chaired by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), was laid before this place. Unless the government is prepared to deal with the feeling that there is a need for reform, these reforms and any others will falter. I commend the honourable member for Bonython and the other members of that committee for the work that they put into the consideration of how we can make this parliament function better. In particular, I thank the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), who I think made a notable contribution in the reservations they expressed in the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have commented, a number of reports analysing the way in which the parliament operates have been produced. This is not the first report. None of the procedures will work&mdash;not even the changes to the existing standing orders as recommended in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS> report&mdash;unless the person who occupies the chair and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) are prepared to comply with them. I want to deal in general with a number of aspects of the whole debate. I will do so briefly before I go into the details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second point is that it is very important that people within this place understand that, to enable parliament to function, prime significance has to be given to what goes on in the parliament and not to the other ancillary activities in which we are all engaged. A very good example is this debate at the moment. A number of honourable members are interested in the subject. However, committee meetings are going on. We have all sorts of other commitments: some are with constituents; some are with policy formulation; and some are spent in various ways around this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, in order to make parliament function, we have to elevate the importance of this chamber. There are a couple of aspects to that. It is not just about the attendance of members; it is very much about the degree to which ministers treat debate in this place. I am appalled that virtually no minister of this present government attends during the committee and second reading stages of bills, and certainly no minister sums up debate. Of course ministers cannot be here all the time, but the prime duty of a minister in charge of legislation is not to get a parliamentary secretary or somebody else to attend at those times; it is to be here to listen to the views of members of both sides, to take note of them and to respond. I do not believe that that is being done adequately. There is no proposed change to the standing orders in that respect, and I regret that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also problems in terms of the overall way in which this place functions. I have said before, and I repeat, that I would like the House to be more of a debating chamber. I would like to see this bar table narrowed. I would like to see the two sides of the House brought closer together. For all that the geography, or whatever we call it, of the House of Commons is different from ours&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they found mine, which was quite an achievement. I think this is an important point. If we spoke from the middle of the table, at least we would be speaking almost in a theatre of the round. I know that where we speak from at the moment is traditional, but there is a difficulty. The point I am making is that this ought to be a debating chamber. I do not think it is succeeding in being one. Regrettably, I do not think these changes will achieve it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But enough of the philosophy. There is too little time left and I have a lot of things that I want to say about the details. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) spoke about these changes being only temporary. If that were so, I do not believe that there would be changes now being introduced to standing orders. Over the years that I was Leader of the House, if we changed anything&mdash;as we did frequently&mdash;we tried to introduce it by way of a sessional order, which allows for consideration, adaptation and then adoption into standing orders on the next occasion that the parliament meets. I would far prefer that to be so. I disagree with the proposed amendments to the standing orders. I believe they should all be sessional orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I was horrified to hear from the honourable member for Moore the idea that these main committee meetings are not to take place in the No. 1 committee room of this parliament. As far as I am concerned, that means the whole of this proposed change is being treated in a totally light-hearted fashion. I do not believe it is appropriate. I believe they should be in the main committee room of this building. From my point of view, I will be doing everything to ensure that that is so. If 2R2 is to be the forum, then that is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the detail of these changes in several ways. I turn first to the matter of questions without notice. The honourable member for Bennelong and I spent a little time dealing with that matter the other day. It is not the matter of the Prime Minister being asked 18 per cent, or whatever it is, of questions; it is very much a question of the availability of the government to answer all matters within its responsibility, the whole field of its responsibility, on any day when this House sits. We know that individual ministers have a responsibility only to answer questions within their particular bailiwick. If the Prime Minister or the Treasurer (Mr Willis) are not here, it will be extraordinarily difficult. Let us take, for example, a day when the balance of payments figures go through the roof and the Treasurer is not in the House. We cannot pursue the matter. I think there are any number of reasons why every minister should be available. That has been the tradition here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why every one of the Australian traditions have to be thrown on their ear. In this chamber we want to see the preservation of those elements which are good for democracy. As far as I am concerned, the accountability of government and the exercise of responsibility by ministers are fundamental. These changes to question time do not achieve either of those dictums. For that reason I am totally opposed to them and I regret the fact that the sessional order is being put forward in that form. I think it is a sessional order with respect to questions without notice but I might be wrong; it might be a standing order, too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other detailed matters that I want to address. With respect to the quorum of the main committee, I believe that three is insufficient. If we are going to make the committee work, we need more than three members. I thoroughly approve of it being required to be at least some from either side of the chamber, but I do not think three is sufficient. It is no good having two or three people in the chamber and believing that we will have a sensible debate. I think the numbers should be somewhat higher than that. For my money, I would like to see it somewhere not less than 20, but perhaps that is too many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the detail there are a number of other matters that I wanted to pursue. The first concerns change 17, new standing order 304A. I do not believe that it is acceptable to have this sin-bin concept introduced and the member being suspended without a vote of the members of this chamber. As far as I am concerned, I am prepared to go along with the idea of having a one-hour suspension. But it is totally inappropriate for a person, who demonstrably is still a member of the governing party of the place, to be in a position to suspend members for one hour, or any other period, without a vote of this chamber. This is not a place where arbitrary judgment can be exercised, other than in extremis. I understand that there are provisions for dealing with gross disorder. But that is different. We are not talking about 304, 304A or 306. I am talking about circumstances where members are to be temporarily suspended. It is not satisfactory that that be exercised without a division or without an opportunity for this parliament to decide that that person should be so suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is then the question of the sitting hours. I was interested in the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong. I am one of the very few members of this place who has had a home in Canberra. As many members would know, my first wife had a brain tumour and at that stage we just had to come from where I live to Canberra. But people do not understand the sort of life that members live. Like many of my colleagues, I travel more than 1,000 kilometres every weekend. I frequently travel home from functions at 2.00 a.m., get home at about half past three or four and start work the next morning at about six. To say that it is ridiculous for us to work until 10.30 at night when we are here is just balderdash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What these hours will do is to ensure that the committees, to which so much is being referred, will have to meet while the House is sitting or sit at night. This idea of us all going home is just not what is going to happen. I do not agree that rising on a Monday and Tuesday night under these standing orders is going to achieve anything. I like the idea of rising early on Thursday night at 6.00 p.m., but, let us face it, many members will not be able to get home. I am one of them and I do not live that far from Canberra. It will not be possible for many members to return to their own homes that night. People need to understand that very few members live in Canberra. If we want to go home, then we want to go home to our wives and to our families but we do not do that in Canberra. I do not see how all these high-minded ideas would work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, I am entirely in favour of an absolute law which says that this House should not rise later than 11.00 p.m. That is not being inserted in here. I would far prefer that there be an arbitrary requirement that there be no suspension of standing orders which would require this chamber to sit at any hour after 11.00 p.m. Let us not be beguiled into thinking that, because we have some new sitting roster, we are not going to get a rush of legislation and that, at the end of the session, we are not going to have reasons to sit longer. I would far prefer, at least on Monday and Tuesday nights, that we sit until 11.00 p.m. and that on every night that this House sits there be an arbitrary requirement that we do not sit after 11.00 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about some detail of standing order 101 and the routine of business. I believe that on a Monday there should be provision for a discussion of a matter of public importance. I do not support having question time at 3.00 p.m. I think that is too late. I like the idea of question time at 2 o'clock, although I accept that there are difficulties for some. So 2.30 p.m. would have been a compromise. I am also a bit apprehensive that 12.30 p.m. is too early to commence on Monday and Tuesday, given that we have shadow cabinet and party meetings. I do not think we will be able to get the business done. The sitting hours worry me; I do not think they are as they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of matters have arisen today. One is the question of evidence from committees of this place and the other is the question of privilege. There is no reference to it here in the changes. However, I was interested in the ruling given by the Deputy Speaker with respect to the matter of public importance discussed today. We do need to look at a number of matters which are not now being considered. If there is going to be change and reform, the sort of ruling given by the Deputy Speaker is a matter that could well have been introduced by way of a sessional order; it was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters relating to sitting within this chamber also concern me. I have spoken about this on other occasions. I notice from new sessional order 315 that strangers will not be allowed into any part of the chamber or any part of the room where the main committee is meeting. That means that if the committee is meeting in 2R2 nobody will be allowed in, which is rubbish. It is essential, therefore, that we at least sit in the main committee room where there is an opportunity for people outside to come in. We do not want to sit in privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, television&mdash;which I am all in favour of, although I question the degree to which it intrudes into our lives and the way in which it has changed the character of the place&mdash;is not the same as allowing the public to sit in. There has to be room for the public to sit in. As I have said on a number of occasions, I would like to see a special visitors gallery at the back of this chamber, as there is in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point relates to the limitation of debate in urgency motions. Since amendments circulated by the government are allowed to be included in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, amendments circulated with two hours notice by the opposition should also be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an advantage in amending our sessional orders but I regret that it is being done by way of changes to the standing orders. I am very apprehensive about the consequences of the change to questions without notice, but I am quite prepared to give the idea of a main committee a go, subject to the remarks I have made. As I said, I trust the government will rethink the question of where it meets. Any venue other than the main committee room will be regarded as unsatisfactory. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on proposals which will bring about the most substantial reform in parliamentary procedure for many years. The proposals include many of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>. The committee was chaired by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). It is a pleasant irony that the last day of the existing procedures in this House should be the last day of sitting for him, as he resigns tomorrow for an important assignment overseas&mdash;one of the worst kept secrets in modern times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bonython made a tremendous contribution in his decade as a minister, and he leaves many achievements behind him&mdash;the establishment of Medicare; the introduction of what are probably the world's most effective measures against AIDS; in the area of trade, work that went towards the reform of GATT and pursuit of the interests of the Cairns Group; and significant social security measures. He gave us more than 16 years of his life. We shall miss him, his intellectual penetration and incisive wit. But his last achievement, his work on the reform of parliamentary procedures, will be of permanent benefit to this place and to the cause of parliamentary democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on Tuesday, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) moved almost 27 pages of amendments to standing orders to bring the recommended changes into effect. They are actually more radical than those proposed in the report. Essentially, there are three major reforms. The first relates to changes in sitting hours. The House is to sit four days per week on a pattern of two weeks on and two weeks off, rising at 8.00 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and at 6.00 p.m. on Thursdays, enabling most MPs to be home that night. Meal breaks are to be eliminated. As I said, the sitting pattern will be two weeks on and two weeks off. The total sitting time is slightly more than at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reform is the creation of a main committee or second chamber, which will increase the amount of time available for debating legislation and which will, I hope, reduce government application of the gag or guillotine. The third reform relates to question time, making it less gladiatorial and giving greater opportunity for genuinely seeking or providing information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the changes in sitting hours. My only concern is that, if MPs simply disappear at 8.00 p.m. or 7.30 p.m., when the adjournment debate begins, it may make the committee system unworkable, as many committee meetings now take place at night. I hope that will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second chamber reform is the most important, but has been barely commented on in public debate. It creates a parallel rather than a linear or sequential model for debate. Traditionally, the time given to a particular bill is determined by several factors: its political importance both to government and opposition; the ticking of the clock; and a spatial factor&mdash;the requirement that our legislative process be carried out in a particular place, this chamber, and nowhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister in 1978-79, there was an experiment in having debates elsewhere for the committee stage of bills. This was abandoned because the then government felt that the system unduly benefited the opposition and because ministers felt very exposed. Nevertheless, this system has worked very well in the House of Commons. For example, if there is a bill reforming the law of bankruptcy, those MPs with expert interest in the subject should be able to devote time to a long and detailed debate without feeling that they are slowing up the process of legislation of broader significance, such as the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposes that the second chamber have no quorum provision, except for the requirement that there be a presiding officer, a member from the opposition and a member from the government. Typically, the second chamber will debate non-controversial bills and there will be no divisions. I agree with the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) that visitors to the main committee must be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to promote attitudinal change and changes in our political culture, and that means radically improving the quality of debate, which tends to be soporific, if not catatonic. Typically, when question time ends, the chamber is deserted. Members do not stay around for debates. Typically, speakers arrive in the chamber only a minute or two before the time the previous member's speech is due to end. Also typically, it is rare for a government MP to comment on, or analyse, the remarks of an opposition MP or vice versa. Our debates are anything but that. I can recall very few memorable debates in this place. The Native Title Bill was one; the debate on the Gulf War was another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should dispense with whips' lists. We should give priority to ministers and shadow ministers to set the parameters of the debate, but then the call should be given to MPs who are in the House following the debate and who jump as soon as the last MP sits down. If they do not jump, they do not get the call. If we could change the culture to make debates interesting, oppositions might not need to call quorums. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surprising that the opposition, in its criticism of the government's proposals, has concentrated on question time to the virtual exclusion of the others&mdash;especially the fact that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will answer questions on only two of the four sitting days, Monday and Thursday, with other ministers to be rostered for particular days. That is in line with House of Commons practice, except that the British Prime Minister appears only once each week for 30 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our proposed changes, the opposition could, if it wished, ask every one of its questions of the Prime Minister each Monday and Thursday. I find any suggestion that the Prime Minister will be absent from two question times because he fears the withering onslaught of the opposition questions grotesque. If anyone has anything to fear in question time, when the Prime Minister is in full flight, it is the opposition itself, which rarely shows grace under pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are good reasons for changing the nature of question time. It will get away from the idea of a gladiatorial contest day after day, with blood on the axminster, and to make it a genuine request for, and provision of, information. This may sound naive, but we have to work on both sides to raise the public reputation of the House, especially at question time, which is the only time each day when the House itself, the press gallery and the public galleries are packed. This means fewer dorothy dixers, as the Prime Minister said, and no more questions or answers which are personally abusive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the changes to question time because they will involve a range of the culture if they are going to work. The range of questions asked is far too narrow at present. Ministers and shadow ministers should be put on their mettle. About half of the members of the crowded opposition front bench rarely have an opportunity to ask a question, and opposition questions tend to be concentrated on a handful of ministers, and they are excessively concentrated on a particular minister if he or she is singled out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To follow on from the comments made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I would be deeply concerned if I thought the changes would increase the power of the executive over the legislature. I do not believe that the changes to question time are intended to do that&mdash;I hope not, anyway. I suspect that it will not change the balance much, but if it does, the opportunity will be the opposition's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that the government did not accept the recommendations of the Blewett committee on supplementary questions&mdash;that is, the right of a questioner to ask one more question if the answer to the original question is thought inadequate. It works well in the House of Commons. Of course, it must not be abused. But the House of Commons forms an astute judgment on that. If ministers cannot handle supplementaries, or alternatively, if members are abusing the system because the question has been adequately answered and they just want to double up, it reflects against the member who attempts to ask the supplementary. So I think the process is self-correcting. I hope that the new system will change the culture of question time: it will only work if it does. The change is long overdue and will improve the professionalism of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said that there will continue to be room for theatre, but that the time has come for the emphasis to be reweighted in favour of substance. I agree. The theatrical aspect is important, but we could do with less theatre of the absurd or, in some cases, Grand Guignol. I have often complained that this parliament is really more like a national repertory theatre than a legislature, with the press gallery essentially drama critics looking each day for trials of strength, muggings and pratfalls. The nation deserves better than this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that with the range of proposals we have put up we have an opportunity to re-examine the way in which we operate this parliament. It is the understanding of the government that the changes are not necessarily thought to be immutable and that we have to give them a try over the next session or two to see how they work. If it is thought that there should be areas of improvement, my understanding is that the Leader of the House would be sympathetic to making further amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>As honourable members would be aware, we are effectively debating these three motions across-the-board throughout the evening. As you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, are well aware, members will not be called to order when they decide that they will speak on times of sittings and all that sort of stuff while we have question time propositions before us. In my opening remarks in an earlier speech today, I did not speak to the issue of question time knowing that I was going to move this motion. There are one or two things I need to place on the record in order that we can be held to them in the course of consideration of these matters over the next few months and when they come up for reconsideration by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very interested to watch bits and pieces of the debate so far. A couple of very good ideas have come up from both sides of the House which I think at the end of this debate we are going to have to sit down and think through. I think one of the good things that we have got into over the last few years is a mode of changing standing orders, not necessarily how everybody wants them changed, but at least we have been doing it. They have been sacrosanct for so long. To get into a mode of changing them we might as well start picking up good suggestions when we see them, be they from the procedure committee or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion does a couple of things, and it has been very little noted that this is the case. Firstly, it imposes a level of discipline on the answering of questions on notice that hitherto has not existed in standing orders. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, you are a noted placer of questions on notice, some  of which, we suspect, are drafted by people who have been even more prominent Australians than you. You will no doubt welcome this particular change, which means that ministers will have to get a leg on. A member will be able to rise after 90 days and ask the Speaker why a minister has not answered a question on notice and the minister will be obliged to write a reason to the Speaker as to why that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second element of the motion concerns the rostering of ministers. The change is quite simple; everybody knows what that procedure means. Effectively, half the cabinet will appear each day. What is not in standing orders is what is, nevertheless, the undertaking of the government, and that is that there shall be 14 questions each day in the 45-minute period that is set for question time. If they are not answered in the 45-minute period which is set for question time, then question time will proceed until they are answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been made that prior to this government we got through many more questions in question time. The average now is around 10 questions in that 45-minute period. We will no doubt get the argument that in Malcolm Fraser's time it averaged about 15. The difference was very much the way in which questions were asked as well as the way in which questions were answered. It was a source of some joy to me when I was a junior member of this place, and in opposition, having just been elected in 1980, that on one day of the week it was the view of our party whips and leaders that all of us backbenchers would have a go in question time, unfettered by the demands of the frontbench. We were all obliged to go away, invent our questions&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite a lot of questions were asked on those particular days; I acknowledge that it was 15 questions a day. It was also a different opposition. We gave our backbenchers a go. When we gave the backbenchers a go we found that, of course, the ministers do not answer the backbenchers' questions at great length. Often the ministers are only vaguely aware of the materials that the backbenchers bring before them because the backbenchers tend to have a whole variety of interests that do not actually appear on the front pages of the newspapers every day. In those circumstances ministers have a working knowledge but not a pejorative knowledge of the materials to hand. So the idea that one would serve up five or 10 minutes on the subjects is not there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one of the other two days, at least, only half the questions were asked by the frontbench. This could be interrupted when there was a bit of a thing running but by and large that was the case. We had many more questions, much shorter answers, fewer dorothy dixers from the government side of the House and fewer prepared questions by the coordinating committee from the opposition side of the House. Members other than the Leader of the Opposition had a go and this parliament actually exercised some scrutiny. That has disappeared. The intention is that this should bring it back. Whether it does or not will be open to a great deal of questioning, and we will find out over the next few months. The opposition is unhappy with it. That is disappointing but it is not necessarily a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegation is made that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) seeks to evade scrutiny. Those outside this chamber and those on this side of the chamber respond to that accusation with a huge horse laugh. It is well known that the Prime Minister relishes the opportunity of question time. This is an exercise of some self-sacrifice on his part, but the chamber will be the better place for it. It is in the spirit of trying to make question time better, in the same way as it was in the spirit of trying to make this House a more effective place, that we supported in the first instance the motions we have just passed&mdash;the suggestions of the Blewett committee. In this instance, we have not gone along with them but we have made some changes, some of them partially influenced by the directions in which the Blewett committee suggested we should go. We will see whether these changes work. It is our intention that they operate only until the middle of the year and we will make any necessary adjustments after that point. But I hope they will work. I hope they will make question time better. I think the public would like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a saying that you can be too clever by half, and I think the debate that has taken place here and in the papers during the last few days is a good illustration of the government being too clever by half. I was deputy chairman of the Standing Committee on Procedure, which brought down the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time</EMPHASIS>, from which some of the changes we are talking about today were derived.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the report was released there was a lot of anonymous backgrounding of the press by government members. That was a breach of the privilege of parliament. It can never be proven, but we always know who these people are; their fingerprints are all over the newspaper reports. The changes were reported as reforms. The reports said, `Here is a great reform of parliament which is going to loosen it up', and they got away with it. Then the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got too clever by half. He decided that he was going to put forward to this parliament a proposal whereby he would come to question time only once a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the committee's original suggestion: the House was to sit eight days each fortnight instead of seven. We agreed that on the Monday of each of those sitting weeks we would have a limited roster with the opposition having a right of veto over that roster. The only person whose absence could not be vetoed on those two days per eight was the Prime Minister. So the Prime Minister could be excused on two days per eight days. But he had no excuse on six days out of eight and, if the opposition so required, no other minister could be excused on any of the eight days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister got too clever by half. He took a proposal to cabinet that he should come only once a week; the very different rostering system being put forward here now has only the slightest, most accidental resemblance&mdash;</PARA>

The reason he has to be here twice a week instead of once a week is that his own backbench revolted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred to being too clever by half. The press swallowed all this last December. They used the term `reform', which I will not use. It is incorrect language; it insinuates a value judgment of changes. They are not reforms; a reform is something that is better. They are changes in which some wee little details are better. If we do not have an answer from the minister to a question on notice after 90 days we can get up and say, `Mr Speaker, the minister has not answered my question'. It is not clear whether stamping your foot at the same time, raising your voice or really whingeing will get you thrown in the sin-bin under this brand new, untried standing order but there is a chance that it will. Come on!  What sort of a reform is that? The committee knew it was not much of a reform; it said it was a start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a member of the committee, and I put on the record that the only government member of the committee with the gall to speak about this dog's breakfast of a version of what the committee recommended was the chairman, who does not have to be here after today to answer for a single word he has said. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) is not speaking, nor is the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) or the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). They are not on the speakers list, which is not a great omission, but they were all here last December yabbering away about what a wonderful report this was. They were very keen then to talk to the press, on and off the record, but they are not too keen today to get on the record and talk about the actual changes being discussed now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have nothing against the new honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick); he is a pleasant chap. I have told him that, if he does as well as his Liberal predecessor, he will be doing very well indeed. But he has been here less than 12 months and he is going to get up and tell us how good these changes are; how much better it is going to be than it has been for the last 20 years. I am a bit disappointed with the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). He is supposed to have a photographic memory. He read to us a speech which made references to things apparently in the report that were not in it. </PARA>

They have clearly stopped reading the report, looking at it and thinking about it; they are reading only their own government's propaganda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the main committee. A little more will be said about that. The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) and I put in a dissenting report about the main committee because we had a very uncomfortable feeling about it. We put down on paper what we thought was wrong with it. But we felt that the shuffling off of a whole lot of legislation to some other room was a further part of the general denigration of this parliament which we see day in and day out in a variety of ways, including non-attendance of ministers through debates and the way things are conducted at question time. Page 8 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Main Committee would meet in the main committee room and would meet during sittings of the House.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not breaching privilege at all when I say that the reason it was called `the main committee' was that the committee's entire discussion was in terms of the committee meeting in the main committee room. The report states that that is where the committee would meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the committee cannot govern this, but the suggestion came from government members and it was promoted by government members. I see a couple of members of the committee have put their names on the speakers list. Whacko! They are right down at the end; it will be interesting to see whether they get time to speak. The suggestion was always promoted in those terms. I know that government members could not guarantee it but it was their idea. They promoted it at length and came forward with all the details. Something as basic as whether committee meetings could be held in the main committee room was surely something they could have chatted to someone about. You would think that a former Speaker, the honourable member for Watson&mdash;a great advocate of the main committee&mdash;would have known that we could not always use the main committee room because the Senate also has access to it. It is not a House of Representatives room; it is not one that the Speaker can decide this chamber will have sittings in.

There were a number of reasons for the royal commission, not least of which was that a scandal would blow up, the journalists would write their stories and the newspapers would print them. But the Premier would act as though nothing had happened, as though the scandal did not exist. At press conferences the Premier would talk about something else the whole time.

As I have sat here this last week and heard this unlikely word `reform' tripping off the Prime Minister's tongue, I thought about what the Prime Minister's version of the committee's recommendation on rostering would be like. I thought we would have some ministers getting up&mdash;all these ministers of whom nobody wants to ask a question. Apparently, ministers cannot even get their own backbenchers to ask dorothy dixers. The honourable member for Lalor would know a bit about that from when he was minister for science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penny dropped. We had a debate here once and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) put on the record why we do not have ministerial statements anymore&mdash;because the Senate wants to debate them. So ministers in the Senate are the only ministers who make statements anymore. How dare that unrepresentative swill want to debate government statements! So now we get ministerial statements in question time instead. Under these new arrangements, we will have nothing but minor ministers&mdash;whose actions are not newsworthy and therefore do not get asked questions&mdash;making wall-to-wall ministerial statements. That is what question time will be like&mdash;ministerial statements from the juniors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is fair dinkum it will extend the activities of the main committee&mdash;it will make it function in a real way&mdash;to include debate on ministerial statements and reports. We have only talked about legislation in the main committee, but reports come in here that never get a word said about them. It is said that we need the extra time because in the non-controversial areas people need to say things that are relative to their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are speeches relevant to members' electorates deriving from reports&mdash;just as relevant as anything that goes into legislation. I see that the honourable member for Lalor is nodding his head in agreement. The same goes for ministerial statements. These do not have to be items of controversy&mdash;not at all. But it is just as important for members to get those speeches on the record in parliament. We will see how fair dinkum the government is.

Once they are in the standing orders they might as well be set in concrete because all the previous standing orders on this subject have taken 20 years to get through.

<PARA>It is with a great deal of pleasure that I introduce the Australian Sports Drug Agency Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Purpose of the bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is for an act to amend the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990. These amendments have become necessary to allow competitors, tested under proposed complimentary state or territory anti-doping legislation, to have access to the same appeal provisions as those available to competitors tested under the ASDA act. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Background</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members are no doubt aware that Australia is at the leading edge in the fight against drugs in sport. The government has made it quite clear through its legislation, and through the policies adopted by the Australian Sports Drug Agency and the Australian Sports Commission, that it is determined to ensure that athletes who cheat on their fellow competitors, their sport and themselves are not able to escape the sanctions they justly deserve. However, the ASDA act only allows the selection of national level competitors to undertake drug tests. The testing of competitors below this level requires the enactment of state and territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All states and territories have agreed that such legislation is desirable and have provided a commitment to its introduction. However, in order to ensure that there is a coordinated national approach, extensive discussions have been undertaken on the need for the states and territories to introduce anti-doping legislation which is complementary to existing Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASDA act was amended in July last year to include provision for the states and territories to confer broader powers on ASDA to undertake testing of state and territory level competitors under complementary anti-doping legislation. The states and territories are now able to introduce legislation allowing ASDA to test competitors defined in state and territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Major features of bill</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that legislation introduced by the states and territories is complementary to, and consistent with, the existing Commonwealth anti-doping legislation in all major respects. It is particularly important that there is consistency in the protection of the rights of the competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major element of the ASDA legislation relates to the protection of the rights of competitors who have been selected to provide a sample. The ASDA act includes appeal provisions for all competitors who have failed to provide a sample or who have returned a positive test result. It is important that all competitors are treated equally and have equal access to such appeal provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes provision for the states and territories to confer jurisdiction for review of decisions by ASDA following a positive test result, or failure by a competitor to comply with a request by ASDA to provide a sample for testing, on the Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal or federal court. This will enable the states and territories to include in their complementary legislation provisions for access by competitors tested under state or territory legislation to the same appeal provisions as are currently available to competitors tested under Commonwealth anti-doping legislation. This should ensure that a consistent uniform appeal mechanism is available to all competitors tested under any anti-doping legislation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current arrangements competitors tested under Commonwealth legislation may be listed on the register of notifiable events. The bill includes provision for the names of competitors tested directly under state or territory legislation, who have returned a positive test or who have failed without reasonable cause to provide a sample for testing, to be included on the register of notifiable events. The bill also includes provision for the removal of names of competitors tested under state or territory legislation from the register of notifiable events. These amendments provide for the same procedures to apply to competitors tested under state or territory anti-doping legislation as currently apply under the ASDA act. The Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales and Victoria have each developed complementary anti-doping legislation and I understand that, as soon as the provisions in this bill come into force, they will be seeking to introduce their legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to avoid variations in the drafting of anti-doping legislation in the states and territories, and to ensure that all legislation is consistent, the Commonwealth has written to the states and territories proposing that the drafting of the legislation be referred to the parliamentary counsels committee. This committee consists of heads of Commonwealth, state and territory offices of parliamentary counsel and will assist in the development of model complementary anti-doping legislation consistent with existing Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The model legislation can be adopted by each state and territory and should avoid unnecessary variations in drafting between the ASDA Act and complementary legislation. The development of model legislation should also simplify and encourage the early introduction of consistent anti-doping legislation in each state and territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful introduction of complementary legislation in each state and territory will enable ASDA to carry out tests on a considerably greater number of athletes. This will make it increasingly difficult for competitors who choose to use drugs to avoid detection. The introduction of this legislation will mean that Australia has one of the most stringent anti-doping policies of any country in the world and will send a clear message to the sporting community throughout the world that Australia will not tolerate the use of drugs in sport. I am sure that this will be taken into account by overseas athletes proposing to train and compete in Australia, particularly in the period leading up to and during the Olympic Games in Sydney in the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no additional financial obligations imposed on the Commonwealth by this bill. Additional testing by ASDA under state or territory legislation, including the costs of the tests, will be the subject of agreements between ASDA and the respective states and territories. All additional costs will be met by the states and territories. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, like all members, welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and to convey my thoughts on the recently announced changes to the arrangements concerning procedures of the House, which include new sitting times. I have listened with great interest to the views of the long-term honourable members opposite. I was especially interested in the views of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), who seems to equate longevity in this place with wisdom. If that were the case, why are those opposite still on the opposition benches after 11 years?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a newcomer, having been a member for only 11 months, I think my views are not as blinkered as the views of those opposite. As a father, whenever my two young daughters, Sarah and Hannah, were troubled, anxious and unable to relax and go to sleep, I used to tell them fairytales. This eventually would relax them and they were soon worry free and asleep. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to recount one such fairytale tonight to honourable members, with a view to allaying their fears and concerns about these proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once upon a time, in a land far to the south in a country called Australis, there were murmurings of discontent coming from the people's palace. Australis once consisted of warring tribes that continually fought over their boundaries and the trade that flowed across them. Some 113 years after the initial invasion and settlement of this great land, the wise elders from the warring tribes decided that enough was enough. They decided that for future security and prosperity the tribes must come together in one alliance and form one country. A people's palace was set up in which the chosen members, from villages scattered across this vast land, came together to settle disputes and determine how the country should best be run. These chosen ones met on a regular basis throughout the year and spoke long into the night and early morning on issues of importance to the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came to pass that two main groups emerged in this people's palace: those of the red shield and those of the blue shield. In the people's palace those who supported either group faced each other across a large table. Members of the red and blue shields chose from among their ranks knights and ladies to be their leaders, their decision makers and to be responsible for the good government of the country. This being a civilised country, all disputes were settled in one big battle held at least every three years. But this battle, important though it was, was not one of death and destruction, like those in other countries. This was a battle of words and the winning of hearts and minds. Those of the red shield had won the last five battles and had really gained the ascendancy in the people's palace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leader of the red shields, Prince Paul the Fair, had a very strong team of knights and ladies to assist him in the ruling of the country. Prince Paul and his court set in train a series of measures to change the rules governing conduct in the people's palace. He chose a former member of his court, Prince Neal, to come up with a series of well thought out measures. Those of the blue shield were furious over these proposed changes for, having lost the last five battles, their influence amongst the villagers was on the wane. They were desperate for a new leader, someone who could lead them to victory. Their current leader, Prince John, was nervously watching other knights on his frontbench&mdash;Prince Little John, Prince Peter, Prince Andrew, Prince Alexander, and a fair woman named Lady Bronwyn&mdash;as rumour had it that they wanted to replace Prince John as their leader. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were also some murmurings to these proposed changes from those of the red shield. One named Daryl expressed concern that, without Prince Paul to lead them daily, those of the blue shield may be more advantaged. Prince Paul allayed these fears, saying that these changes would allow his fellow knights and ladies to toughen and ready themselves for any future battles and would enable members of both shields to work more effectively and constructively for the villagers they represented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would realise, I am relating this fairytale to illustrate a point. Our parliament is close to its centenary. Its rules and regulations were framed long ago when travel and communications were in their infancy. We, as members, are now expected to be abreast of a multitude of portfolios in order to be able to represent effectively the needs and aspirations of all our constituents. I appreciate the many traditions that have been established in this parliament and feel honoured to be standing here representing the people of Franklin. But, as the needs and requirements of our parliament change, we must do the same when it comes to the procedures of this august House. Surely this place is about growth and renewal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a vast array of standing orders to govern the way we act. As a newcomer, however, viewing their effectiveness over the last 11 months, I have no doubt that changes must be made. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said to the House the other day in relation to these arrangements, if we want to preserve the institutions of our democracy, if we want them to work more effectively, we must be prepared to change them where necessary&mdash;and, of course, there have been great changes since many of these institutions and procedures were first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trial period for these changes&mdash;radical changes in the view of many of those opposite&mdash;will surely allow us to judge their value and effectiveness. While I admire the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is here at the moment, and respect his views about the workings of this place, as a new member I heartily support the proposed changes. They are long overdue, and only a reformist party would have the courage to introduce them into this parliament. I humbly congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) for his zeal in persevering in his desire to change the way in which this House works. I commend the proposal to the House and urge all honourable members to wholeheartedly get behind these changes, to let them go through their trial period and to work constructively to see that they are implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested in the analogy of the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick) of princely kingdoms and courts because we have suspected for some time that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is starting to get imperial delusions. The honourable member for Franklin has half confirmed that by using what was, in the end, not a very clever analogy to demonstrate his views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time</EMPHASIS> was the product of our deliberations over the matters of bills, questions and working hours. As co-signatory to the dissenting report that was prepared by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and me, I must say that many of our suspicions have proved to be well-founded. In the first instance, when the Prime Minister talks about reforming parliament to make it work more efficiently and to provide the opposition with a better forum within which to present its views, we have to be a little bit suspicious. Why would a government with a comfortable majority make things easier for the opposition? It is highly unlikely. It does not fit in with the logical sequence of events that occur in here. Many of the things that have occurred have borne out my view and the view of the honourable member for Moncrieff that the whole alleged bipartisan approach to reforming the various aspects of our work was, in the end, a push by the government to introduce changes that make it more convenient for the government to run the House of Representatives in the manner in which it sees fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a problem that has arisen in relation to the main committee. I was very sceptical about the main committee. I have some doubts as to whether it will provide the sorts of opportunities that the government and the majority report alleges a main or alternative committee debating forum will provide for members. It was recommended that we were to have the debates of the main committee in the main committee room. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would know as well as I that it is very difficult to transpose the atmosphere, the dignity&mdash;although sometimes that is not quite as pronounced as at other times&mdash;of this chamber to another chamber. In other words, we are concerned that the actual debates that will occur will do so in an atmosphere of perhaps lesser dignity, lesser importance, and that those bills that are sent to the main committee for the second reading debate will become second-class as far as those members who are participating in the debates are concerned. We are still unsure&mdash;at last news&mdash;as to whether or not the main committee room will be available to us to participate in main committee debates. A couple of hours ago there was a rumour that we may be going to one of the smaller committee rooms, which is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the procedure committee's discussions, and as outlined in the dissenting report, we were concerned that transferring debates to the main committee would end up demeaning the standard or the standing of those debates. If that committee is going to meet in a small&mdash;dare I say&mdash;dogbox committee room, that will certainly bear out our suspicions. One could argue that it would virtually become a Potemkin parliament. I do not see how it will come to pass that debates held in small committee rooms will have the same standing as debates held in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the rationale for the main committee was to provide extra debating time on non-contentious bills, but it was not designed to consign those debates to a lesser standing. Some members represent constituents who feel very strongly about the less exciting pieces of legislation, such as that dealing with the pig slaughter levy. I imagine that if they were standing in a small committee room debating legislation, they would feel that the importance of it had been devalued quite considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report, to which the honourable member for Moncrieff and I dissented, recommended a 3.30 p.m. question time. Much has been said about the problems that would be caused for the reporting of parliament's activities as a result of moving question time to 3.30 p.m. or, as is the case in the Prime Minister's statement and in the amendments to standing orders, to 3.00 p.m. The 3.00 p.m. proposal would still cause problems for what are the best opportunities for the community, the Australian people, to have their government&mdash;the people who are administering their tax money&mdash;scrutinised by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that question time is the focal point of the day's activities. It is a very important part of the parliamentary day. Likewise, so are the matters of public importance and the censure motions that generally occur immediately following question time. Members of the media expressed some concern about the time available to them to prepare edited commentary on what occurs at question time and then during MPIs and censure motions. Having question time commence at 3 o'clock will still cause a fair amount of unnecessary problems for those who are involved in the preparation of news material, particularly for television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that things have changed since the parliament has been televised. People are probably much more aware of some of this so-called theatre that the Prime Minister talked about in his speech, some of which appears to have been plagiarised. We are looking at a situation where the MPIs and the censure motions are being pushed off the edge of the reportable day of parliament's proceedings and therefore there is less opportunity for the opposition to scrutinise those ministers who are administering taxpayers' money on behalf of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight on television we saw a very skilful melange of question time and MPIs put together as part of the news reporting so that people were able to get as full a picture as possible in a 30-second or one-minute report of what has gone on today. It is very important that we see the danger in moving question time to 3.00 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff and I opposed the movement of question time to 3.30. I suppose 3.00 p.m. was seen as a bit of a compromise. It has still gone too far; we should really be ensuring that question time and the ensuing debates, MPIs and censure motions are held at such times that allow the electronic media in particular to provide the Australian community with as full a report as possible. The Prime Minister said in his address:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to preserve the institutions of our democracy, and if we want them to work more effectively, we have to be prepared to change them where necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough; that is true. But one has to ask: why the changes? Why are we going to be changing some of the ways in which we do our work in this building? There is no doubt that there is a need to change the sitting hours. I for one would not be prepared to accept the responsibility for those who have perhaps become ill as a result of the hours and the extraordinary pressure under which we work in the House of Representatives. That goes not only for members of the House of Representatives, but it also goes for those people who work here, whether they are in the reporting staff, the support staff, the clerk's office or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a consistent series of attacks on the institutions that underpin our system of parliamentary democracy. These attacks are part of a consistent program to provide changes to undermine and to break down the resistance to changes which would bring about the type of society which many on the other side would like to see in Australia&mdash;a society that is quite alien to the mainstream of Australian people. They, too, are wary at times, and ought to be more wary, of those social engineers, those people who say that they know better than they how to run their lives or how to run the system of government under which they live. In particular, the flag has been mentioned. I will not dwell on the flag other than to say that it represents something that is an obstacle to change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Speaker's chair is an interesting part of the symbolism of our chamber. Mr Deputy Speaker, we know that the simple chair in which you sit is the result of a conscious decision of the government to make a change from the Speaker's chair in the old Parliament House, which would have been seen as a link to the past and to the constitutional origins and British parliamentary traditions that have underpinned our system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a decline and a breakdown in the standards of ministerial behaviour and responsibility. I do not have to dwell on that; it is in the minds of many people around the country right at this very moment as they witness the embarrassing and absolutely indefensible situation in which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) finds herself as a result of the sports rorts scandal, which has grown out of all proportion to the origins of the program and has become probably one of the most dangerous scandals facing the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have changes in the symbolism in our armed forces and changes in and attacks on the judiciary. As I said, these are seen as obstacles to the type of society that many of those opposite would like to see inflicted on the Australian people. So why does the House of Representatives need to be changed? First of all the Prime Minister says, `Question time doesn't work'. I agree with that. He then says, `There is too much legislation for too little sitting hours'. I agree with that. One of the things that the Prime Minister did not say, of course, is that ministers take far too long to answer questions on notice. I certainly agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that many in the community lament the type of behaviour that goes on in this chamber at question time. They look at the disorder that sometimes occurs and wonder what on earth their members of parliament are doing. The pressure and heat that are generated in question time are often a result of the intense frustration felt by members of the opposition as they watch ministers fail to answer questions and take an inordinate amount of time to give answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over recent years we have seen the frequency of questions decline to an extraordinary number. This has been particularly more pronounced in the last couple of years. We have heard the Prime Minister say that he will guarantee 14 questions a day. Of course, there is no such guarantee in the amendments to the standing orders that are proposed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today. If we look at the other commitments that have been given by the Prime Minister in the past, we see that this one would have to be consigned to the dustbin as one which no-one in his or her right mind would possibly believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter to be discussed is the use of answers as non-respondable debating points. As the Prime Minister quite rightly pointed out, question time has ceased to be an interrogation. It has become a point scoring exercise, principally because ministers are using the opportunity to debate the answers to the questions or elements associated with them and use those to bludgeon us because we have to remain in silence. We are unable to do anything other than ask a brief question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I came into this parliament, probably a bit innocently, thinking that there was such a thing as bipartisanship. I have since discovered that that is a myth; there is no such thing. The government sucks in our contributions and then spits them out whenever it sees fit. As we saw with the report on the broadcasting of televised parliamentary sittings, when the Prime Minister does not want something to take place, he cuts it off; when he wants to do something, he does it, ignoring the views of some members of the committee, including recommendations of the majority of the committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Perhaps the committee's report has not been fully adopted. There was obviously a range of debating positions within caucus, and there are probably many views on the other side of the House. What has been suggested is a trial of some new procedures to see how we get on. Apart from the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), I do not think people have too many problems with the sitting times. I think it is a very useful change. I do not see a problem with moving some of the debate into a smaller chamber. It would appear a bit ludicrous for half a dozen people, and sometimes less, to sit in this beautiful chamber when a great deal of business could be conducted in smaller rooms, as we conduct parliamentary committee work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to question time seem to be exercising the minds of most people. I agree with what the Leader of the Opposition said in his speech on 8 February: question time is absolutely fundamental to our democratic process. But the comments of those opposite suggest that there is a major hijacking of question time, and we hear all this talk of imperialism. We on this side of the House are not the imperialists; we are the republicans. I feel that this is where the fairy story is going off the rails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister strongly dominates the parliament and confidently deals with the opposition. This is not simply because he gets so few questions from the Leader of the Opposition; when he does get them, he deals with them very confidently. What he is saying is that he also has confidence in his ministers to be able to operate under increased scrutiny. If he did not have confidence in his ministers, he would be suggesting that he has to be here each day to protect them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very positive move and, as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) indicated, it is very important that the executive be placed under scrutiny not only by the government but by the parliamentary caucus because, as the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said in his address, we are also backbenchers. There is a very important opportunity being made available to provide further scrutiny of our ministers. I would have thought that this would have been welcomed by the opposition but it seems that this is not something that it is looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore spoke about the timing of question time and the problems the electronic media are having. I believe parliament must make the decisions about the timing of our operations and, if that requires the media to make some alterations to their timetable, then that is the way it should be done. I believe there is far too much focus on assisting the media with their operations. This is one of the difficulties that have resulted in the need to look at these changes because, in a sense, one could argue that the media's appetite&mdash;as I think I argued in my speech on 17 December&mdash;is fairly voracious. The stories have become quite skewed because the media pick up grabs for the 6 o'clock news. As the Prime Minister said in his speech, form has become more important than substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Announcing yesterday his changes to the sitting hours pattern, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) again saw the need to camouflage his reasons, this time by referring to the report of a committee chaired by the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). The fact that the actual recommendations of that committee, along with some of its observations, have been largely ignored should come as no surprise, given the increasing disdain of the parliament as an institution displayed by the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our institutions have been the target of the Prime Minister's vituperation. However, his performance yesterday was notable for what he did not say and what he did not give as his reasons. Not surprisingly, this time he resorted to the refuge of scoundrels and claimed that the announced changes are reforms. The word `reform' replaces `patriotism' as the last refuge of scoundrels under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the way the proposals came before the House, pronounced as they were by the Prime Minister himself. Why did they not come from the Speaker? After all, the Speaker is charged with the responsibility of running this place. Perhaps he could not bring himself to do it because either he is not in favour of what is now intended or he is not prepared to be left open to humiliation by the Prime Minister of the kind that was savagely handed out concerning the broadcasting of House proceedings. Either way, we can understand the Speaker's reluctance to chance his arm again, even though that would otherwise have been appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Failing that, why not have the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) do the deed? No. The head honcho himself has done the honours&mdash;no less a person than the Prime Minister. The Speaker and the Leader of the House, though much more responsible than anyone else for the day-to-day running of this place, did not get the nod. This announcement has come from a Prime Minister who will not come into the House to debate matters of great national import, despite the repeated invitations and challenges from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Why should the man who would be king by any other name bother to debate any issue while proceedings in the House and question time are reported time and again in the media as debate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's reputation as a parliamentary debater can never be put to the test in question time. But it suits him to allow the myth to be perpetuated and at the same time to escape real debate and argument. Given the Prime Minister's propensity to substitute longwinded answers to questions for traditional debate, it is possible to conclude that he does have unstated reasons for what is now proposed. Historically, even relatively minor alterations to sitting patterns have been the product of a relevant committee. That is not so this time. This time, a committee report has been used by the Prime Minister as no more than a catalyst to do things his way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously, major changes were championed by the Leader of the House or the chair. That is not so this time. Until now, more often than not such proposals were likely to be the subject of a free vote. That is not so this time. The Prime Minister has deliberately locked his sheep into his grand plan, the central feature of which is to make life easier for himself. This matter is essentially about mollycoddling a precious Prime Minister not noted  for  his physical  or  intellectual stamina.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical effect of pre-empting a free vote on such fundamental changes is to stifle debate on the details. That is predictable from a Prime Minister and a government that in each parliament and each year for 11 years have engineered the increasing irrelevance of this chamber. Over the period we have seen question time degenerate into a farce. The use of dorothy dixers from the government's back bench is virtually the absolute rule. Responses to government questions are, in the minds of media viewers and readers, almost universally regarded as debate, so much so that the Prime Minister seems to believe it. The number of answers attempted has fallen away abysmally. More frequently than not, the greater part of responses to questions without notice are mostly or totally irrelevant. It is an embarrassment to have to attend question time. It has become an insult. </PARA>

If ministers with responsibility for the proposed law attended debates and answered criticisms at the conclusion of second reading debates and in the committee stage, who would be in a position to judge in advance, as the Prime Minister does now, whether a bill is routine or uncontroversial? All government legislation is potentially controversial, and so it should be. More sitting days is the obvious remedy for many of the real shortcomings which undeniably exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as often proves to be the case, the obvious and simple answer is the one unlikely to be adopted. Sitting on more days would also help to settle sitting hours more satisfactorily. Instead of cramming more hours into a sitting year of up to 60 days, fewer daily hours would be possible without sacrificing&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;productivity and the material we can get through in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these proposed hours are a recipe for health problems for honourable members and their staff rather than the opposite, as has been claimed. I would have welcomed the opinion of health care professionals, and I would have welcomed the Prime Minister having sought such information. Many honourable members, in common with the rest of Australia, prefer to take recreational exercise during daylight hours. The minister at the table is no doubt under instructions to walk during the day. When will he get a chance to do so with the threat of a division hanging over him? The proposed hours will make that impossible, particularly during winter in Canberra. A number of our colleagues, including the minister at the table I think, are already under doctors' orders to take a brisk walk every day at the very least. When will they get that chance with the new hours in place?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, however, my resistance to what is now in the offing is that it does not accord with the reasons offered. The procedure committee's logic, although some of it was arguable, was in evidence, but the ultimate version, the Prime Minister's, lacks the committee report's credibility. What is left to discuss is merely a hotchpotch, its only justification being this Prime Minister's and this government's need for greater convenience. It promises little by way of improvement and a lot by way of executive imperialism. It is a gigantic move away from the ultimate supremacy of the House over the government of the day. </PARA>

They were all former ministers for health at times when I actually worked for that department. It has been a rather odd experience for me to be here and see all those people disappear. Certainly, the honourable member for Bonython has made a great contribution to the Australian Labor Party and to public life, and no better example of that exists than Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the motion and the amendments that are contained in it. First I mention a fairly simple one but one which is so sensible that I am amazed it has not been thought of in the past; that is, to have four sitting days in a week instead of three. I am a bit astonished by the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher). Judging by what he was saying, he thinks  that  we  should  sit  for  365  days  a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there are many aspects to parliamentary life and one of them is coming here, as we are elected to do. But it is also pretty important for us to be seen occasionally in our electorates, to serve the people that we represent and to be available to them. We have to come here and pass legislation. As a matter of fact, I enjoy coming here but only for a certain amount of time. If we have to come here for a certain number of weeks, then it makes obvious sense to maximise the time that we are here and be as productive as possible. I would have thought that four days is a minimum that is sensible for a sitting week.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the hours of sitting. I must say that, of all the things we have to get used to when we change our lifestyle as a member of parliament, what I have found the toughest has been the long nights of sitting. I suppose that I have come off lightly compared with people in the past who have regularly been here until 5 o'clock in the morning. But last year I did find that it was fairly tough. Not only do we have to be here until 11 or 12 o'clock but often, because the adrenaline has been going and our minds have been active, it is fairly difficult to go straight to bed. We find that we may have to spend an hour or two unwinding and then go to bed. However, we then have to get up the next morning and come in to start all over again at 8 o'clock for one committee or another. I found that one of the more difficult things to adjust to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the latest possible sitting time of 8 o'clock in the evening is a much better idea for all the obvious health reasons. Also, I believe that it will ensure better productivity and better performance on both sides of the House, dare I say it, if we have four days a week and if we have sensible hours, finishing at 8 o'clock. That way we can have our dinner, perhaps have an earlier night, and then come in and be a bit fresher in the morning than sometimes we have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to question time are, I suppose, the most controversial of the changes, judging by the reactions of opposition members in particular. I must admit that there were concerns on our side about the decision to reduce the appearances of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time to only twice a week. But they were political concerns in that we thought the Prime Minister was being a bit generous to the opposition by only coming two days a week. We were a bit worried that he might be letting them off a bit lightly. In fact, I think he is doing the opposition a favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incredible that the opposition, in its self-righteous indignation, opposed this change and complained about it because I think that, if anything, it would be better for the opposition to have the Prime Minister here only twice a week to clean them up, as he usually does, rather than having him here every day. Having said that, despite the reservations that have been expressed by some of my colleagues, I think it would be a very good arrangement because it will give other ministers the opportunity to answer more questions and to develop their skills. It will also give members on both sides of the House&mdash;if it is possible for some members of the opposition&mdash;the opportunity to develop their skills by asking more questions. Despite the reservations that some people have on both sides of the House, the new question time format with the rostering system is, on balance, a sensible idea. I am looking forward to seeing how it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have talked about the opposition. If the Prime Minister or anyone on this side came in here and moved a motion that the sky was blue, the opposition would find a way of opposing it. That is what this opposition does. It has no policies; it has nothing to offer the Australian people. I notice that the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) suggested that they should change their name to `the party for looking backwards'. I cannot think readily of anything to top that in terms of a suggested name change. The opposition really is a party of the past. The performance of those opposite shows it. They have nothing to hang their hat on and so they oppose at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have also been the main contributors to unruly behaviour that parliament gets a reputation for. There has been a lot of concern expressed by people during this debate about the image the parliament has in the community; the image that we get on the 6 o'clock news every night where we have a few seconds of grabs from question time, of some of the more robust comments made by both ministers and the opposition. That does not go down too well in the electorate. Of course, it is the opposition that causes that, by and large, because it is in its interests to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember when I was on Campbelltown City Council as a Labor alderman. In the first four years that I was there Labor did not have an absolute majority but, with the support of a couple of Independents, we were seen as being the ruling party, if you like, on Campbelltown council. We had the mayor as a result of that. What our opponents did, this motley collection of Liberals and so-called Independents who were to the right of Genghis Khan, was to seek to make council unworkable by moving points of order, rescission motions and just causing general unruly behaviour. It had the effect, which was certainly the aim of it, of giving council a bad name. We were getting headlines in the local papers that `council is unworkable' and there were fights and brawls going on. Of course, any publicity of that nature in a chamber&mdash;whether it be a local government or a parliament&mdash;always reflects badly on the incumbent government, which is why opposition parties do that sort of thing. They cause the disruption; they cause the chaos. It reflects badly on the government. That is the way the public perceives it because that is the way it is covered in the media. </PARA>

Someone has only to mention the thought of having a new flag, a head of state who does not live overseas or, dare I even suggest this, a republic or maybe even changing the constitution a little bit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After listening to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), I must say that he seems to have completely supported my basic contention, which is that the proposals to change question time have not been based on idealism, as he would suggest; rather they have been based on the ALP's pragmatic judgment that the image of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is damaging the status of the party. This point came out very clearly yesterday when I had a bus load of constituents up here for question time. At the end of the procedures, I went to say goodbye to them. I was met by a number of ashen-faced people who asked, `Is he always like that?'. Another one said, `That's exactly what he looks like on television'. I said, `Yes, he's like that almost every day of the week'. It is not unlikely, therefore, that the Labor Party has decided that there is a lot of sense in taking its baseball bat out of the chamber for three days out of five.  For that reason, the Prime Minister will be appearing in our midst for only two days of the week. It is also significant that the Prime Minister, in his efforts to appear as statesman in this particular subject, in his opening remarks to the House on 8 February, said:</PARA>

<PARA>parliament has performed over recent decades, we can only come to the conclusion that, while there is perhaps a need to make some changes, equally some of the other changes proposed have been effectively forced on us because for too long every effort seems to have been made to prostitute the standing orders of the parliament in such a way as to achieve a position where it is now claimed that the parliament is virtually unworkable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first statistics relate to questions without notice. The period under review is from 1970 to 1993, so it is a reasonable spread. It goes back to the Gortonian period of the coalition. It goes through the Whitlam period, the Fraser period and the Hawke and Keating period. It demonstrates that, since 1970, the maximum number of questions were asked between 1976 and 1979, during the Fraser government. Over that four-year period, the number of questions asked ranged between 1,447 and 1,021.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any other similar period between 1970 and 1994 under a Labor government demonstrates a hopeless comparison. For example, in 1993 the number of questions asked fell to 429. In 1991 it was 861, which is double that figure. But at no stage over the last 11 years did the total number of questions asked in any one year remotely approach the statistics between 1976 and 1979. There are a number of reasons for that. One is that the average time taken to answer a question has gone up significantly in recent years. Let me give some examples of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1970, the average time taken for a question and answer combined was 2.6 minutes. In 1992 it was 5.8 minutes. In 1993 it was 4.7 minutes. The evidence is clear: the trend has been inexorably upwards. Therefore, the content of question time, in terms of the number of questions asked, clearly goes in the opposite direction; it has fallen significantly. In 1970 the average number of questions asked per day was 16.7. During the Fraser years, that figure rose to 19.3. But, under Labor, over the last 11 years, it has been at best 13.7 and at worst 11 questions per day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of whether we consider time or the number of questions asked during question time, the evidence is absolutely conclusive. One of the reasons why question time has failed over recent years is that the government of the day has wanted it to fail. If we relate that again to the number of sitting days, we again find a very significant trend. In 1970 the House sat for 73 days. From 1970 through to the end of that decade, the lowest number of days in which the House was in session was 60 and the average was around 68 to 75. But over the last 11 years it has fallen as low as 38 days in 1990 and 46 days in 1993. Yet we are told that we must reform the system because question time does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be among those who take the view&mdash;and I think many members on both sides do&mdash;that we share concern about the public perceptions of parliament. For better or worse, the introduction of the televising of parliament, and of question time in particular, has undoubtedly confirmed in the eyes of the viewers their very worst expectations of parliament and of some people in parliament, including the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But is the response to that problem&mdash;and I acknowledge that it is real&mdash;to simply take the Prime Minister out of the chamber, so he only comes in here for two days a week? Or is the response to look at the more fundamental problems: why ministers spend so much time burbling on answering questions; why the number of ministerial statements has fallen; why more ministers now use question time as a mechanism for effectively making statements and why the ultimate outcome of all that must be that fewer questions are asked and, sadly, that too many questions are asked of too few people? The bias in question time in recent years has definitely seen&mdash;and I use the language of other speakers&mdash;a gladiatorial context. Many questions are from the leaders of the opposition to the Prime Minister or to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also take the view that it is better that there be a more even spread of questions, especially across the entire frontbench. And, yes, I would like to see members on both sides of the chamber have the freedom to stand up in their places and ask free ranging questions. I do not want to see the whip on the government side, as I did today, come into the chamber with a handful of papers and all his meek, mild mannered little backbenchers lining up to be force-fed their pieces of paper so that they can take their places and ask their set piece dorothy dixers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the basis of the so-called Westminster system, which is meant to be a free ranging system by which backbenchers can represent their constituents and also ensure that the ministers and the government of the day are kept on their mettle. Mistakes are made on all sides in this, but the biggest error must lie with the government because it is the government which has the executive responsibility to make parliament work and to make it work well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We get told, when it is convenient for the government to say so, that we are following the Westminster system in terms of question time. That may be so to a point, but the important thing is that Westminster sits significantly longer per year than we do. While it is true that the prime minister appears only twice a week in Westminster, the facts are that there are more weeks of sitting and therefore the prime minister is in the chamber for a longer period. The significance of this, therefore, is that we must be on our guard to make sure that when reforms are put forward they are reforms which are going to be useful and which are going to make parliament work in a more efficient and effective manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the question of the second chamber. I believe that the second chamber as a concept is worth a go. I am prepared to take that view and I do so in the context of knowing that these are but trial procedures and let us see how they work. There has been some argument and some concern about which size chamber should be used, whether it should be the main committee room of parliament&mdash;which I should point out to the House is a shared committee room; we share it with the Senate, and that could create some difficulties&mdash;or whether there should be a room specifically set aside for the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am one of those rare members of this House who actually recall when we were last in government, some years ago. An attempt was made to have estimates committees in the House of Representatives. At that time we had a committee set aside and it was quite well attended by members who were interested in the range of estimates which were under review. I remain to be convinced as to how many members will actually turn up for these secondary debates or, as it was described by one of my colleagues, for this `second-class legislation'. I hope that is not the case because no legislation is second-class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad thing about our adversarial system is the presumption of the public that we fight about everything. The public is generally unaware of the fact that something like 80 per cent of the legislation which goes through this chamber does so without any major division. We could perhaps get through much more legislation by having the two chambers working parallel. Some of that 80 per cent of legislation which is not subject to party controversy would be able to go through the second chamber. It is often legislation of a technical nature and, therefore, members may be able to ask more questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put on record my belief that the second chamber should also be used for ministerial statements, or at least opportunities should be taken for more ministerial statements in both chambers. An attempt should be made to introduce a greater debating procedure and more time for debating ministerial statements and the annual reports of departments, which are regularly tabled in this chamber and which then disappear into oblivion. They are never subject to review within the parliament, yet the whole purpose of those reports to the parliament is so that members have the opportunity to comment on them if they so wish. The truth is that the structure as it currently works does not give us the opportunity to comment. I hope the introduction of the second chamber will enable that opportunity to be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the matter of question time. The Prime Minister made the observation yesterday, I think it was, `Oh, well, if you can't get questions up, put them on notice'. I am one of those who uses the process of questions on notice rather lavishly. I could not help but smile wryly when I heard him make that remark because I put a question on notice only quite recently, question No. 829. On 1 February I asked the Prime Minister upon notice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will he supply all information deleted on grounds of irrelevance from documents supplied in response to my Freedom of Information request of 6 September 1993. </PARA>
<PARA>Guess what the answer to the honourable member's question was? It was no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the response we get from the Prime Minister, who tells us that we should put more questions on notice. We may well do so, but there is certainly no guarantee that we will get an answer from a man whose arrogance is now supreme and who has now decided not to come into the chamber for most of the week and who will now deign be present in our midst for only two days a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that, by introducing an additional day of sitting, all these problems will somehow or other be overcome. I do not believe that will be the case. As I said, unless there is a clear provision in standing orders, which there is not, that answers must be short and that they must be pertinent to the quest-ion, we are going to make very little progress</PARA>
<PARA>in real terms in trying to reinstitute into this chamber a sensible and effective system of questioning of ministers in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other issues were raised in the address by the Prime Minister: the handling of legislation, parliamentary questions and the question of how long we sit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to use my full time tonight because, as is clear from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and list of speakers, there are many honourable members who wish to comment on this report. One thing we can say about this report is that there is not a lot of agreement on it. The only thing we can all agree on is that the current system does need to be looked at, but we all have our views on what changes should occur. Another thing we can be sure of is that change does not come easy. The parliament of this nation, throughout which we now expect people to confront workplace reform and productivity, should be looking to confront the issues. The Liberal Party talks about it; we have done it. If it is good enough for the factory floor to confront those issues, it is good enough for this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion we are talking about a trial period. It is very much a situation of, `Let us see how it works, and if changes need to be made we can do that at the appropriate time'. We will not find out whether those changes will work until we actually try them. I believe the sitting time changes will assist the sanity and good health of all members and staff of Parliament House. The overall total number of hours remains, which ensures that there is still sufficient time for debate. I certainly will be glad to get home on a Thursday night. I have a young family whom I love very much, and I also have a very busy electorate office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted the comments earlier tonight of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) regarding the fact that we can sit for another 40 or 50 days per year. Maybe all the honourable member for Curtin does is sit in this House. This House is an important part of my job as a member of parliament but so is my electorate. I spend a lot of time in my electorate whenever I can. It is a large and growing electorate and it has people there with problems. They are regularly in touch with me and I with them to ensure that I can assist them. It is a lot harder to assist them when we are stuck in Canberra for most of the year. Do members of the opposition not like their electorates? Are they scared of going out in to their communities? Would they rather just stay up here and hide from them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second chamber, I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). It is worth trialing. It should help speed up the time taken to consider legislation while at the same time actually allowing more time for the consideration of all legislation. By having the two chambers that will be able to occur. Having the two chambers may be of great assistance to the Liberal Party. I guess it could probably put half of its frontbench in one chamber and half in the other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even for the honourable member for Fisher. I believe the new system being proposed for question time will widen the scrutiny of government. It should allow more questions, as the honourable member for Bradfield noted earlier, compared with the recent experience, and it should effectively allow greater exposure of ministers other than the Prime Minister or the Treasurer, who tend to dominate in terms of questions asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is question time not working at the moment? A number of speakers have mentioned that and gone through some of the reasons. Certainly the length of answers is a problem and the previous speaker raised a number of statistics on that issue. There are some other statistics which I managed to get together this afternoon from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which I think also point to some of the problems with question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the period I have been here, several things occurred. During question time 208 points of order were raised&mdash;178 from the opposition, or 85.6 per cent. We heard 39 points of order from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer); 31 from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey); 25 from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard); and 12 from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who is in the chamber now. They make up the ton, with a total of 107 points of order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a total of 50 warnings by the Speaker concerning unruly behaviour&mdash;49 for the opposition, or 98 per cent. Again the honourable member for Mayo figures prominently, with 11, as do the honourable member for O'Connor again, with 10, and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), with a recent burst, with five. They make up over half the total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total number of interjections for this period was 517. The opposition made 388&mdash;75 per cent of the interjections. It really shows that when we are talking about the length of answers we have also to take into account the points of order, the warnings necessary by the Speaker and the interjections. They all take up time. As can be shown, the opposition has done its best to take up as much time as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One funny thing happened today in the parliament during question time. A question was directed to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), and he waxed lyrical about the senator who is soon to arrive here&mdash;probably&mdash;as the new member for Mackellar. A funny thing happened; for once there were no interjections. The opposition was quiet, listening intently except for the honourable member from the National Party, whose name escapes me, who made a comment about extending the time of the Leader of the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speaking of interjections, the total for the honourable member for Mayo has now gone to 12. That change to question time is something we have to trial. It has been said by some members of the opposition that this is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) running scared, but they do not ask him questions. If he is running scared from the opposition, I would hate to see him when he is going full bore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier tonight the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) asked why we would change the rules to assist the opposition when we have a comfortable majority. The simple reason is that we have a comfortable majority and do not feel threatened by the opposition, and I am very confident that I will not be a oncer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes may not be perfect, they may require adjustment and change at the conclusion of the trial period, but I am very confident that I will be sitting on this side of the chamber after the next election and the honourable member for Mayo will prove to be a oncer as shadow Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worry that the opposition is once again showing a lack of flexibility and an inability to look to the future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) was kind enough to pick up many of the interjections that we made from this side of the House. This side of the House, of course, is very concerned about a number of the changes being made by the government in the proposal before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat heartened by a number of the comments made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), a person I greatly respect. I must say that as a child I remained glued to the television set watching his exploits on the BP <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pick-a-Box</EMPHASIS> program. I was particularly interested to hear his comments that the changes before the House should alter the culture of question time. He&mdash;and I agree with him&mdash;expressed the hope that the changes will improve the professionalism of this House. He also said that what we are debating should not be considered to be something which cannot be altered in the future but something which we are trialing over the next session or so. He expressed the earnest hope that the alterations before the House have the potential to make a much more efficient and much more appropriate parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the honourable member for Lalor is correct. I am not convinced that he is because the government, if it were serious about introducing all of these changes as trial changes, would have introduced sessional orders and not made permanent changes to the standing orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I would like to congratulate the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) on his committee report. It is sad that the government did not pick up all aspects of the committee's report and, indeed, of the minority dissenting report of members of the opposition. I take this opportunity to wish the honourable member well in his new appointment as High Commissioner to London.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes recommended in his report are wide ranging and there are many alterations. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in his contribution stressed that we will have to gauge how these alterations do or do not work in practice. The government must be fairly certain of a permanent status for a number of changes because, as I said before, the government altered the standing orders and did not merely introduce sessional orders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the suggested alterations are supported by the  opposition. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has indicated that we are taking a quite reasonable approach. We do not believe that all of the standing orders of the House, all of the practices of the House, should remain immutable. We accept that as Australia goes on, as the years go on, we must, as a parliament, remain relevant to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a sad indictment of this place that parliament is held in total contempt by the ordinary people of Australia. People are disillusioned, they do not accept that there is fair debate in this chamber, they are cynical about the abuse which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) heaps on the opposition, and they believe that we act like a whole lot of schoolboys and schoolgirls. Clearly the system, as we understand it, has not been working in this House. That is why I was particularly pleased when the committee, chaired by the honourable member for Bonython, took this very important issue on board. I must say I was hopeful of substantial changes which would have improved the working of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are elected to this parliament to represent the people of Australia. This parliament and this House are greater than each and every one of us. I think it is a sad indictment of the government that question time has been allowed to descend into the shambles that we have seen since the election in March 1993 and certainly during the tenure of the former Speaker, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the changes are not entirely controversial. It is clear that we cannot keep on sitting the hours that we have been sitting. It is absolutely crazy that the House of Representatives should sit until 11 o'clock at night, as has been the case during the time that I have been in the parliament. At times, of course, the government suspends the 11 o'clock rule and we are here until 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock. This is in a parliament which sits not many more than 60 days a year. Some years it has sat more and some years it has sat less. But it is not a place where the representatives of the people are given adequate time for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not object to the proposal for the Speaker to have the opportunity to sin-bin offenders who have not incurred the wrath of the chair by being sent out for a longer period. We think that is important. We are worried about the proposal for a main committee. This could mean a further reduction of the importance of the role of the House of Representatives in the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was heartened by the remarks of the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). He, like the honourable member for Lalor, suggested that the changes we are debating today are not necessarily changes that will stay in place forever. I certainly hope that the government will come back into this place after the sessional orders relating to question time expire in the middle of the year and say that we will have a reasonable question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main objection that we in the opposition have is to the absolute travesty to which this government will be reducing question time. This parliament sits for not many more than 60 days a year. At present, the Prime Minister and the entire ministry must come in here and accept the questions that we ask&mdash;although, as we have seen through the sports rorts affair, ministers do not even try to answer the questions. They filibuster, avoid answering the questions and heap abuse on the opposition but, at the very least, they must be here. We are able to ask them questions. They do not endeavour to answer the questions, but the press are able, if they wish, to expose weak ministers&mdash;ministers who have done the wrong thing by not answering the questions that we, as representatives of the Australian people, ask at question time&mdash;in the media the next day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was somewhat amused by the remarks of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley) when he said that the Prime Minister will be making a sacrifice by not coming into question time every day. The people of Australia will certainly be pleased that the abuse we hear from the Prime Minister every day will not continue. But, with a parliament sitting only 60-odd days, it is important that the Prime Minister be here to be held accountable for the actions of his ministry, his government&mdash;the government of Australia&mdash;during all of those 60 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly true that a rostering system of ministers applies in the House of Commons. But it has to be realised that the House of Commons sits for some 120 days a year. I understand that the Prime Minister in the United Kingdom parliament is available for about half of those days&mdash;about 60 days a year. This Prime Minister is proposing to be available for about 30 days a year. So the Prime Minister of Australia will be in the parliament of Australia one in 11 days out of 365 days a year to be held accountable for his actions. I do not think that is acceptable. It indicates that the Prime Minister is afraid to front the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the sports rorts affair and the $30 million of taxpayers' money which was spent largely in government electorates, we can see why the government is running scared. The only reason the Prime Minister will come in for half the time on Mondays and Thursdays is the backbench revolt by the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) and other members. If the Prime Minister had had his way, we would have seen him for a mere 15 days out of 365 days a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every cloud has a silver lining, though, and one minor plus in having a rostering system is that when the Prime Minister is not here our frontbenchers and backbenchers will be able to target other weak ministers. Let us face it, the government's performance has been pretty tacky, ordinary and iffy. So, if the Prime Minister and Treasurer are not here, we will find that the other ministers on the front bench, many of whom ought not to be ministers, will be able to be subjected to scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that we are guaranteed only about 14 questions. I gather the Canadian parliament has on average about 40 questions. From the time of Prime Minister Fraser to the time of Prime Minister Hawke, there has been a reduction in the number of questions asked per sitting day. After the present Prime Minister stabbed former Prime Minister Hawke in the back, fewer questions have been asked every day this parliament has sat. Consequently, major changes are being made to the standing orders and sessional orders of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition comprises very reasonable people. We are prepared to take government at the next election. We hope to receive the support of the Australian people at the next election. I am quite confident that we will have the numbers to move on to the other side following the next election. Some of these changes are acceptable; some are disastrous. Honourable members ought to look at our program outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) prior to the last election. We wanted to make this place work. We suggested that there should be an independent Speaker so that the Speaker, not as now, would be able to exercise free and open discretion without fear of being disciplined by his own party. We believe that is a very important step, and we hope that we will be able to implement it after the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, some of these changes are disastrous. We think there are some reasonable people on the government benches. I believe that, if the Leader of the House had had his way, he would have brought in a more reasonable package than we are debating tonight. I hope that, when what we are saying about these disastrous changes comes to fruition, the government will reconsider its position, taking into account what we and the honourable member for Bennelong have said, so that the matters we are discussing tonight, which some members opposite say are on trial, are changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, members of all parties in this place owe it to the Australian people to make the House of Representatives work. We are supposed to be the representative  house of this nation. When it is run, as it is, as a sausage machine, a sham, a place where democracy does not exist, where the opposition does not get a fair go and where ministers refuse to be accountable, we are bringing the entire House of Representatives, the entire parliament of this country, into disrepute. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you and the government to look at what we are saying with a view to bringing in worthwhile and genuine reform to improve the very flawed package which the minister has brought before the House today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I pay tribute to the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), for leading the committee, of which I was delighted to be a part, in the production of its report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About time: bills, questions and working hours</EMPHASIS>, proposing a range of procedural reforms to the parliament. It is very gratifying to see the contribution of the honourable member for Bonython over a long period in this parliament culminating in the major effort involved in the production of the procedure committee report that has been so roundly adopted in many aspects and which will be a testament to his parliamentary career in Australia long after he has left the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that the government has taken up so many of the recommendations contained in the procedure committee report. The reforms are trial measures at this stage, but they will ensure the ongoing dynamic relevance of this parliament as the fundamental democratic institution of the people of Australia. The important question that we should ask is: how do we ensure that the parliament continues to be the fulcrum for democratic process in this nation? I think these reforms are sensible and constructive in the way they ensure the management of legislation and in the way accountability of the executive to the House is retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased with the recommendations on the main committee. The other change that has not been talked about too much in the course of the debate is the enlarged role for standing committees in some of the legislative processes that will be part of the new parliamentary standing orders. I note, in particular, the new arrangements for second reading debates. In many cases, there will be scope for standing committees to give advisory reports on legislation in a short period after the second reading. Hopefully, these suggestions and contributions will help to ensure that the value of that legislation is enhanced, thereby enlarging further the parliamentary committee process which has developed in the House of Representatives in a substantial fashion in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then turn to the question of the main committee itself. Many speakers have said it is a shame that there is not more recognition of the fact that there is, in relation to much of the legislation on significant issues, not a great amount of division between government and opposition. This second chamber provides a mechanism for a broadening of the scope, particularly for backbench members of parliament, to make a substantial contribution in areas of policy. These may not be the ones that create high temperature debate but they are nevertheless important to large elements of the Australian community. The second chamber will be a place where they can be fully debated and scrutinised and where suggestions can be brought forward by members of parliament. I think they are very constructive changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform of sitting hours has been spoken about by many speakers. I think change is long overdue. Those who talk about the hours of parliament that have operated `since I was a boy listening to parliament' will say that there are historical arrangements for travel to Canberra and will give a host of other reasons. I think it is time to recognise the range of pressures which exist in this building on parliamentary sitting days and to try and ensure that we make all aspects of the parliament building as productive as we possibly can when parliament is in session. I am sure the reforms to the hours are a recognition of that. They are also a recognition of the pressures that apply to members' families and I think the changes will be welcome from that point of view as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the changes, we will be sitting both Mondays in each two weeks of sittings rather than only on the second Monday, as has been the case in recent years. That extra day will provide time for private members' business and give individuals adequate opportunity to raise issues pertinent to their electorates. At the same time, it will provide scope for the broadening of the processes relating to question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the reform of question time will prove to be very substantial and constructive for the parliament. I watched the proceedings in the House of Commons and tried to get a feel for the difference in their approach. It is certainly my view that the change recommended and enlarged by the government in its response to the report is very significant and will be seen as very worth while. It really will mean a return to the sorts of question times I listened to on radio when I was younger. There will be a far more lively and better atmosphere about question time because the scope of questions, the diversity of answers and the flexibility that will provide will be very helpful not only to the procedures of the parliament but also to the community's perception. I think the accountability process will be enhanced into the bargain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear that over recent years question time has become a matter for one or two policy or perhaps personality issues and for one or two of the leading players on either side of the chamber. That is not the sort of question time we will get when we have the roster arrangement as has been outlined. My observation of the House of Commons and the way it operates was that that is certainly true. I do not think any loss of accountability occurred as a result of that. I can see only good coming in terms of the breadth of policy issues that members will be able to raise in question time. For all those reasons, I think these are very positive changes indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the adversarial aspects of question time will remain. That is a fundamental part of our democracy and I do not think we should be wanting to walk away from that&mdash;and we are not. There will definitely be scope for members to cover a whole range of issues which are of great interest to the people of Australia, not necessarily just the few headline items of the media in Canberra with the sort of herd mentality much of its agenda has. Certainly the televising of parliament and the capacity of members to ask questions that may be on the minds of many in the community outside Canberra, in the cities and regions of Australia, will provide a much more productive atmosphere and improve the way parliament is viewed across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The types of reforms outlined are very welcome. No doubt there are always arguments about length of answers to questions and the nature of many of the questions. I certainly think it is often the short, sharp, succinct answers to questions that are the most effective. I am sure the change in our approach to question time with the rostering system will be much more conducive to the whole community feeling that, if there are matters of particular importance on their minds, members can actually come in here and raise those issues with relevant ministers, be they matters relating to telecommunications, veterans' affairs or whatever. Matters relating to social security entitlements and so on can be just as pertinent to many citizens of Australia as the one or two issues that might be the priorities of a tactics committee or a particular agenda that might be pursued at a given point in time. For those sorts of reasons, I think the changes to question time will enhance the democratic institution we are part of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As others have said, we certainly should take the privilege of being here very seriously indeed. I do not believe these reforms do anything other than maintain the continuing vitality that is important to treating that privilege rightfully. I am sure that is what these reforms will lead to. In any event, the important issue is that they will be tried. They are the first major and substantial reforms of House of Representatives procedure in a long time. I think they are worth trying and giving full effect to and I look forward to their success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Achieving a common approach and the sort of response that we hoped would be forthcoming with some bipartisanship proved quite difficult for the Procedure Committee. I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) is in the chamber and I pay tribute to him for his efforts in support of much of those discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do want to ensure that our constituents genuinely feel that their respective member of parliament has the capacity at the peak times of the day, when interest is highest, such as at question time, to raise issues of pertinence and relevance to them. Unless that can be done, I think question time will just proceed to be a sort of gladiatorial contest. That might be good for theatre&mdash;I am not going to suggest that it does not help to shape many of our attitudes within this chamber&mdash;but one of the things we notice quite clearly when we get back to the electorates and talk to people at schools&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for looking after me. He looks after everybody on this side of the House. I am privileged to have the opportunity to speak about this report. As a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I was involved in the preparation of this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time</EMPHASIS>. I am not going to repeat all of the things that have been said by honourable members on both sides of the House about the details of the report. Suffice it to say that this must be pretty much of a record for getting a government response, because the 1986 report of the Procedure Committee is still waiting on a response from the government; perhaps it has been superseded by this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), not only for his parliamentary service over so many years but also for the vision that he had for reforming this parliament. He managed to enthuse all other members of the Procedure Committee with that same vision to reform the parliament. There is no denying that the parliament is in need of reform. Another speaker made reference to visitors to this place. I find that when a group of schoolchildren come in here to see question time they say, `Mr Nehl, we would not be allowed to act like that at school'. I try to explain the drama and the theatre that is involved, the reason for that being that if one sits there like a dummy when so many lies are being told across the floor, the whole of Australia sees them and hears them on television and they therefore become truth, so one has to react. Question time will always have that degree of rowdiness, if you like, but it does stand in need of reform. At every meeting of the Procedure Committee as we were working to develop this report, the honourable member for Bonython said that we had to have a situation where there was give and take, where we would end up with a package which we hoped would be acceptable to the executive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member says, `You give and I'll take'. Unfortunately, that does seem to be part of the result that we have had. While I endorse almost every single recommendation in this report, I do not endorse what has been presented to us today in the new sessional orders and the new standing orders, the new arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that a minority report was put in by the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I did not join with them in signing that minority report for two reasons. Firstly, I believe that it was an absolute act of futility because there was no way that a minority or dissenting report was going to have any chance of influencing the executive. Secondly, I believed, along with the honourable member for Bonython, that we stood the best chance of having the package adopted if we could present it in a thoroughly bipartisan manner with support from both sides of the House. We worked up a compromise. There was a lot of genuine give and take within the committee. The compromise is this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">About Time</EMPHASIS>. But I am afraid that this report bears very little resemblance to what is before us today. It is quite sad that on the honourable member for Bonython's last day, what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has done is insulting to the committee and, quite frankly, is like a slap in the face with a wet Kimbie for the honourable member for Bonython. Again we have seen the Prime Minister's arrogance at work, with him saying what he wants and to hell with what the parliament wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to go on further, except to say that this is a good report. It was a compromise report. It did satisfy the vision of the honourable member for Bonython, and it was a sound vision. Had we ended up with what the report said, it would not have satisfied me, it would not have satisfied people on both sides of the House, but it would have been a darned sight better than the arrogant response of the Prime Minister which has emasculated this report. As I said, it has been like a slap in the face with a wet Kimbie for the honourable member for Bonython. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett) uses wet or dry Kimbies. I certainly do not share that particular view. As a member of the Standing Committee on Procedure, I want to make a few comments. I congratulate the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) on their outstanding valedictory speeches. It is a pity that those speeches were made before this debate because no doubt the honourable member for Bonython, as the chairman of the committee, would have liked to participate in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to respond very much in spirit to the remarks made by the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), who was a member of the committee. I agree with him that, under the leadership of the honourable member for Bonython, members of the committee took very seriously the task of reforming the standing orders and sessional orders of the parliament to make it more relevant, more responsible and more accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are various interpretations of the treatment of the report. I have said on a number of occasions&mdash;and, by and large, most members would agree&mdash;that the report was a good one. It is also fair to say that members of the committee were very concerned that we had to tread warily, that ultimately the decisions about this report would not be our own. We had to take our mind's eye to the position of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the cabinet and their likely attitude to the proposals as much as we necessarily had to take into account the views of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the opposition leadership team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, some time ago, I looked upon the proposition of rostering with a great deal of suspicion. But for quite some time now I have been very much a keen advocate of giving it a go. It is fair to say that the committee recognised some of the resistance to rostering and therefore wanted to offer a limited experiment of rostering. The argument is that we have not had a limited experiment, we have had a full-blown implementation of rostering of question time and that this is somehow outrageous and arrogant. I do not think so. I cannot say that I am dreadfully disappointed that we have gone from a limited experiment of rostering to a full-blown trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has indicated that not only will we put the standing and sessional orders into practice but by mid-year we will want to review them to see how they have worked. Whilst we will not be able to reduce the hurly-burly of question time, opening up question time for the opportunity to question a wider range of members and&mdash;as some have dared say&mdash;actually allowing backbench members to ask their own questions can only be good for the institution of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well remember coming here as a new member and rushing up to Mick Young, the then Leader of the House, with some proposed questions. The response was invariably the same: `Look, they're great questions, Roger, but I don't think we'll ask them at this time'. In fact, I never got to ask any of them at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I have one regret about the contribution of honourable members&mdash;maybe even on both sides of the House&mdash;it is that we still seem to be coming at this from a party political point of view, a partisan point of view, rather than standing up as members of parliament who are really interested in the institution of parliament and not in the dominance of whichever executive we happen to be affiliated with. An example is the contribution of the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). I thought he was going to go on to say that this change to sessional and standing orders would lead to a breakdown in family life, to more crime and to an increase in unemployment, and that it would worsen the trade deficit and drive down the dollar&mdash;so extreme were his views of the impact of the changes. Of course, they will not be anything like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that I was not able to hear all the contributions in the debate, but I particularly want to respond to a point raised by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). It is a view which is consistently expressed by the opposition. Maybe oppositions always express this point of view. It is that we should sit more frequently. We have to understand that, as much as members of this House really enjoy being here and get a sense that they are part of an institution when they come to parliament itself, ordinary members of parliament win their elections not in this place but back in the electorates. As the techniques of campaigning have become more refined and more sophisticated, it is the party apparatus and members' self-survival instincts that dictate that they need to maximise the amount of time they spend in their electorates. I would happily embrace the thought of more frequent sittings, but I suspect that it is impossible, given the demands of our electorates and given the demands of campaigning techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reservations have been raised by opposition members about the second chamber. Perhaps I can understand and respect those points of view, but I think it is worth while giving it a go. Let us see how it works. With a bit of goodwill on both sides of this House&mdash;and I know that there is a lot&mdash;I think that it has every prospect of success. It is also arguably a matter for increased micro-economic reform. We will be sitting for the same amount of time and hopefully getting more legislation through. I have said previously that, whilst the Senate rejects the mechanism of delegated legislation, it will always be the case that a lot of legislation needs to go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps for me the most disappointing issue as to the way the government took up the recommendations was in the time for and the number of questions. I remain unapologetic for saying that I think the suggestion of 16 questions was a good idea. The way the committee had linked the time for questions and the number of questions was such that we wanted to put pressure on ministers to restrict their answers and make them more relevant. How? If the answers were longwinded and irrelevant, I am sure the Prime Minister would very quickly get frustrated sitting in this place for an hour and 15 minutes or an hour and a half listening to those answers. It would be a matter of self-discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was aghast when the Senate put a time limit of four minutes on the answers of ministers. I thought limiting the answers of ministers was an outrageous proposition, but experience has shown that it has worked well. Parliamentarians on both sides of the chamber may need to address either a limitation or the original mechanism proposed in the report. I strongly endorse these changes. I think it is to the credit of the honourable member for Bonython that this report, unlike so many other reports, has not languished without a response but has been hastily implemented. I compliment my colleagues on the other side, as well as on my own, who served on the committee and served the parliament well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take the opportunity this evening to read into the record a letter that I received yesterday from a local solicitor. I raised the matter informally a moment ago with the responsible minister. In part, the letter reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have some clients that have instructed me to raise with you the current discrimination against them. In essence the situation is this: my client Jilau Parker is an Aboriginal woman. She married a white Australian. My client resided on her homelands at Kintore in the Northern Territory. Being both public minded and committed to free enterprise, they established a local community store and they had goods transported from various parts of Australia to the store for sale to the local community. The store was trading successfully. There has been no allegation of profiteering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Central Land Council has decided that the local community should establish a store in their own right. My clients have no objection to that, as they recognise that the principle of free enterprise requires competition. Without due cause or justification, without fair notice to either my clients or the other members of the community, the Central Land Council called a meeting, allegedly at which a decision was reached that my client was not allowed to continue to reside at Kintore. Furthermore, the store was to be closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 19 of the Northern Territory Lands Act 1967, on my interpretation on the specific words used in it, makes provision for an Aboriginal person to be able to apply to the Central Land Council for a lease from which they intend to conduct a business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My clients and I have without fail consistently and  continually asked for the normal commercial negotiating process to commence with advice from the Central Land Council as to what terms and conditions they would require my clients to comply with for the purpose of them granting a lease to my clients to conduct a business from. The Central Land Council has consistently refused to do so and in its most recent letter says that I have misinterpreted section 19. This really is a political hot cake because it combines those elements of discrimination and restrictive trade practices that are no longer tolerated by community opinion.</PARA>
<PARA>This evening in this chamber I have spoken informally to the responsible minister. I hope he will take the matters up when he can. I look forward to some resolution of what seems to me to be a totally anomalous situation. </PARA>

Most of his films were made in the early period of talking films, at a time when nobody other than Charles and Elsa Chauvel were making features here. The films were straightforward, crude but forceful, with clearly delineated characters. But they stood up then&mdash;most of them were profitable&mdash;and they still look good. They also provide a priceless glimpse of the old traditional, monocultural Australia. Hall had an eye for talent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, you might recall that on 3 October last year, a major disaster in the form of a flood occurred in north-east Victoria. At the time of the flood, it was described by officers of the State Emergency Service as the worst major disaster since Ash Wednesday. On the day of the flood&mdash;and every day after, it seems&mdash;I have been in touch with the government; with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and ministers, seeking assistance for the victims of the floods. Assistance has been given in a large number of areas by the state government and in some areas by the federal government. I want to place on record my appreciation to those governments for their assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, consistently since the floods, I have raised a number of grave anomalies that exist with respect to major  disaster policies and laws. For example, because&mdash;thank goodness&mdash;no-one was killed or injured in these floods, although major widespread disastrous damage was done, the federal legislation enabling declaration of a major disaster was not triggered. Had there been a death or an injury, it would have been&mdash;that is beyond doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;and I thank it for this&mdash;has now advised me that it has accepted my submissions that the law is wrong and inflexible. I understand that the government proposes to bring amendments in, during this session as I understand it, to remove that restriction and allow a declaration of a major disaster to be made, even when there is no death or injury, provided there is widespread and substantial damage. I welcome that, and I only wish it had been made on the day of the disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are a large number of people who still have not recovered from the damage caused to their lives and property, such as small business people, families, individuals and farmers. I make a plea to the government that, in preparation of the legislation&mdash;which I hope will come in very quickly&mdash;it will see fit to declare the major disaster legislation to be made effective from 3 October last year. This will enable those people who need extra assistance to receive the benefit of the extra assistance that is available for a major disaster declaration, such as was made with respect to the bushfires in New South Wales. I support the government's announcement to virtually triple major disaster relief payments: up to $2,000 for couples and about $200 per child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Benalla, for example, the maximum amount of assistance received for flood damage was $600. In many cases, these families have sustained greater damage and have no insurance at all&mdash;because insurance is not available for flood damage but it is for fire damage&mdash;yet they received only about $600 assistance. So there is a grave anomaly existing in this area with respect to the treatment of Australians affected by a major disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I requested this help from day one. Therefore, I am not asking for retrospective legislation as such, because my request has been a continual one since the disaster. The government has responded and said it will bring in the change to the law, so the case is made out. I hope I will be able to get the support of all honourable members of the House&mdash;that is why I am raising this issue tonight before we adjourn&mdash;that, between now and a fortnight's time when discussions take place in respect of this legislation, the legislation will be backdated to 3 October last year. I have not got a costing for it but I can assure honourable members that my request is a responsible one. I believe that the extra amount payable by the Commonwealth, if the flood is retrospectively declared a disaster, will be relatively small and certainly nowhere near the amount required to be paid with respect to the bushfires in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am prepared to assist the government to do its research and to come up with figures if necessary to assist in the costing of that. I make a plea before we adjourn tonight that government members support me and do what they can to bring this legislation in from 3 October last year. I can tell the House that all Australians, wherever they are, would support the government. The important thing is that, when there is a major disaster in Australia, we are all Australians together; we all stick together and we do want to see all Australians treated equally. There has been only 100-odd days since the floods. Honourable members should remember that I started to ask for assistance on the day of the floods, and I have continually asked for it since then. Regrettably, it has taken all this time for the government to decide that the law is wrong and that it will change the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a number of occasions in this place we have had some very serious debates about social security matters and, in particular, the impact of certain measures that the government has taken to target benefits. I want to raise this evening a concern that I have with regard to the social security system which impacts on every recipient of social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my constituents, Mr Les Watts, an active community member who works very closely with aged people and veterans, has raised with me his concern about the correspondence process that the Department of Social Security engages in when it is seeking information from its clients&mdash;the people who receive pensions, the unemployment benefit or other forms of income support from the government. Mr Watts has raised this with me because one of the people whom he has helped, and continues to help, is Mrs Mary Cleary, who is almost 80 years old, has considerable vision difficulties and is suffering from dementia. She is an age pension recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, she received a letter from the Department of Social Security's client services section demanding that she complete a client information update within 14 days or face the risk of losing her pension. Several days after Mrs Cleary received this letter, her family read it and immediately approached Mr Watts to express some concern at the possibility of Mrs Cleary losing her pension because she did not complete this form and send it in straightaway. This is a problem with the processes of the Department of Social Security in its correspondence with clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I sought some advice from the office of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) about the schedule of correspondence that comes out from the department, I ascertained that annually the Department of Social Security sends out 80 million pieces of correspondence to its recipients. Some of those letters are several pages long and require quite extensive reading and understanding in order for the client to get to the end of the letter and work out what he or she has to do. It is an issue that I have some concern about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Department of Social Security needs to undertake a major review of the contents of its letters and the way in which it seeks information. I find totally unsatisfactory the process which demands that people respond within 14 days or lose their pension. The fact that we are sending out so many pieces of correspondence to recipients is a bit over the top. We need to review the amount and content of correspondence that we are sending to social security recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sending out all this information costs the taxpayer a lot of money, and the information is irrelevant for very many constituents. It is also a demeaning process, particularly for people suffering from literacy or vision difficulties or those in nursing homes or hostels who are having trouble coping with their responsibilities in terms of their personal financial affairs. In those situations, they have to rely on the advice and support of others to deal with those basic things. That is not something that many people like to do. We need to have a major review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that I have raised also with the Aboriginal community. Last year when our committee was collecting evidence in our access and equity inquiry, we found that the same correspondence is going out to remote Aboriginal communities. The department is demanding that Aboriginal people who live in, for example, Meekatharra or other very isolated places tell them about their shares and investments. It asks them for information updates on how their investment portfolios are going. It is a ridiculous situation. The department is not making any real assessments about the practicality of its correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I request the Minister for Social Security to undertake a major review of the correspondence and ensure that people like Mrs Cleary are not troubled again by such threatening correspondence. In that way, the matter will be dealt with in a more fair and rational manner.</PARA>

In 1992, that had increased to 130 bills out of 284 bills that were introduced into the House. As my colleague has rightly pointed out, it is quite clear that the badly programmed legislation that is brought into the House is triggering the excessive use of the guillotine. An enormous amount of individual legislation is coming into this place. The United Kingdom parliament has 50 to 60 bills per annum. The Australian average is about 215. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the Christmas period I spent some time in Asia looking at the development of industry in that area and comparing it with industry in this country. I would have to say that many opportunities exist in Asia for Australian companies. It concerns me that, as a country, we really have not developed the links with Asia in the way we should have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of rhetoric with respect to development in those areas. Certainly that development has been occurring in some areas with larger companies but there are also many opportunities for smaller companies to develop links in Asia and to expand their manufacturing bases. One of the things that is very difficult for manufacturers in this country is to amortise the costs of their equipment across their production runs in Australia, because we have relatively small production runs compared with those that are available to manufacturers in the South-East Asian and Asian regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If companies are able to buy new equipment and then, after they have used the equipment in the Australian area, pass it to companies in which they are joint venture partners in Asia, those companies are able to get a longer life out of the equipment and therefore amortise the costs of it over a longer period of time. This will give them opportunities firstly to move the equipment down the line&mdash;something the Japanese have been able to do for many years and which we have not quite picked up the skills of yet&mdash;and, secondly, to give them access to markets for products of higher technology that they develop in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say at this stage that some effort really needs to be put in within the government on this area to ensure that these companies, who have worked very hard to develop technologies, do in fact make use of those technologies outside this country. There are two elements to this:  firstly, it allows them to provide newer technologies in this country to compete with imports on the local front; and, secondly, by passing those technologies down the line it allows them the opportunity to compete in international markets, which is something that we as a country certainly need to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problem areas that companies have in being able to compete in Australia. The overheads that companies actually have control of never cease to amaze me. It is in the order of 25 per cent. The rest of the overheads are set by some form of statute whether it be by the taxing system that we have in the country, by the regulated wage systems that we have, or by the cost of transport, communications and whatever. Within that 25 per cent of overheads over which they have flexibility, it is very difficult for many of them to be able to be competitive in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am eager to see some of the micro-economic reforms, about which we see a lot of rhetoric from the government, but very little action, develop. Earlier this week a number of our members indicated that one of the real problems we have is that, whilst the government continually talks about micro-economic reform that we are achieving&mdash;I acknowledge that we are achieving micro-economic reform&mdash;that micro-economic reform is not keeping pace with the micro-economic reform that is occurring amongst our competitors. We really do need to address that problem and recognise that we must at least keep pace so that we do not fall behind in the way that many of the industries, particularly the manufacturing industry, are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that in some areas of industry, such as in agriculture and in mining, we are in fact ahead and that is shown by our results. However, we are having many difficulties in the area of real manufacturing products. It is important for us to look at these areas and give opportunities to some of the smaller businesses in this country. There are some 800,000 small businesses in this country. If we could give them confidence and provide one extra place of employment in each of those businesses, the unemployment that we have in this country today would be almost non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that we can undertake a bipartisan exercise in this area. Certainly we on this side of the House would be happy to support the government in trying to improve the opportunities for small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite so. As the shadow minister asks, was it electronic, did it print out? I must say that, of all the things that I have heard during this sports rorts affair&mdash;and it is now of historical proportions&mdash;there was a terrific cartoon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, I think it was. This cartoon showed a little group of young chaps aged 10 or 11 all in their football gear. The minister came along and said to them, `And which electorate do you play for?' I thought that was one of the best little cartoons about the whole affair.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on record my personal appreciation of the efforts of the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett). Having come into this place as a marginal member, I particularly appreciated the honourable member for Bonython coming to my electorate over the years to help me with the difficult things, especially in the days of health reform, which he did for many people. He is held in high regard on both sides of the House and I do not think one could walk away from this parliament with a better reputation than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you would appreciate that, in what is called the tapestry of politics, there is always a tale or two to tell. I remember a specific instance at the time of the 1990 election campaign, when we were not as popular with the pharmacists as we might have been. The honourable member for Bonython came to my electorate on a Sunday afternoon. He had a terrible cold. He had been on a plane for hours and he needed a box of tissues. The only place in which he could buy them was a pharmacy in Melton, which is in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two pharmacies next door to each other, and both of them were open. The honourable member for Bonython looked at the names and said, `An old mate I went to school with owns that pharmacy. We'll go in there because at least I'll get a decent reception'. So we went in to buy a box of tissues and he asked the person who served him, `By the way, where's Frank?'. Frank had passed on six months earlier and the person who had since taken over the pharmacy was not in the least impressed with the honourable member for Bonython being in the shop. He was prepared to sell him the box of tissues, but he gave us a little piece of his mind on the way out again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Bonython did all of those things. He goes with our best wishes. On behalf of many of my colleagues who have worked with him at the grassroots</PARA>
<PARA>level as well as at the policy level within the government, we wish him well and we look forward to meeting him in the future. </PARA>
