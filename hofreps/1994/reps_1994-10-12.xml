<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to be able to participate in this important debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill, which will have a profound impact on many people who are living in drought devastated areas of Australia, but particularly those in Queensland and a large part of New South Wales. Members would be aware that the primary purpose of this rather urgent bill is to amend the Farm Household Support Act of 1992 to provide for a payment, to be known as a drought relief payment, to farmers in exceptional circumstances due to the extremities of the current drought. I am pleased also that the opposition is largely guaranteeing urgent passage of this legislation because, as all speakers in this debate would have acknowledged so far, this is a rather urgent measure which needs to be taken in order to address a very difficult situation for the people in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of complimenting the opposition for its support for the urgent passage of this bill, I was surprised to see that the opposition is moving an amendment which, while not declining the bill a second reading, asks the House to `recognise the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions' and `calls on the government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist those operators'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us in this House, particularly those of us who represent regional and provincial Australia, would be aware that the drought is having implications for those people who live in the rural towns and cities throughout, in particular, New South Wales and Queensland. However, I believe that there is a little political cynicism in this move by the opposition  to suggest that the government, in its very generous package, should take it a significant step further by extending it to small business operators. This is a $164 million package that will have a significant benefit for people in the drought declared areas. To extend this measure to small business operators would have huge fiscal implications. Coming from the opposition at a time when it is urging the government to cut back on current fiscal measures, I find to be political cynicism to a degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the most effective way the government can assist rural communities is to support the base on which they rest. Throughout the drought devastated communities of Queensland and northern New South Wales, in particular, the way the government can do that is to ensure that the farmers who largely provide an income base for those communities have income to sustain those communities. The nature of the support to be provided through the drought relief payment is such that the money will flow through to families directly into their rural towns and, therefore, into the small businesses that the opposition suggests it is concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government announced this measure on 21 September, both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) suggested that the implications of this particular measure would be to add upwards of $25,000 per annum to the budget of a family of two adults and two children. Clearly, that would have quite profound implications on the rural sector and also, of course, on the small business sector in rural communities. Direct income to meet the day-to-day living expenses also has a significant multiplier effect of around 1 1/2. This means that every $1 spent in a community generates an extra $1.50 in the broader economy. As we know, most of this is going to be disposable income that is going to be used to perhaps pay off some outstanding liabilities at the local supermarket, at the local stock and station agent and at a range of other businesses within the community. It will also, in most important instances, be used to pay for food and other basic necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a very welcome measure but, importantly, I think it should be seen in the context of a range of other initiatives that the government has taken. During this debate, the government has been accused by some speakers in the opposition as being late to the party in recognising the severity of the drought. I for one reject that notion out of hand. If honourable members look back over the record, they will see that the government has progressively implemented a series of programs to allow farmers to manage the drought in appropriate ways. Additional assistance was provided to drought affected farmers in Queensland through the exceptional circumstances provision of the rural adjustment scheme. That was provided in the last budget, which was in May this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year, just a couple of months ago, the minister, Senator Collins, took to cabinet a submission which resulted in a further measure of nearly $14 million being provided to farmers. An additional $2 1/2 million was provided in exceptional circumstances funds to Queensland through the rural adjustment scheme, and $5 million in exceptional circumstances funds was provided as support for New South Wales. We saw additional funding for the training and skills program and, importantly at this time of great financial need, an extension through greater resources of rural counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall that at the time there were some derisory comments made by the opposition, suggesting that this was some sort of miserable handout of only $14 million. I am sure I also recall Senator Collins making the point that, at the time he visited drought affected areas of Queensland and talked to the people about the sorts of measures that he was likely to take to cabinet following his return from that particular inspection, the people were very appreciative of the sorts of circumstances and the types of assistance he was likely to put forward by way of the cabinet submission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The position has continued to worsen and, regrettably, the long-term outlook for drought breaking rains looks very bleak indeed. As a result of this, we saw further action by the government when, in the light of the continued bad situation in Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular, Senator Collins took a further submission to cabinet on 21 September. Prior to that, I, as a member representing a rural and provincial area of New South Wales, had a number of representations made to me. While the drought circumstances in the central western New South Wales centres of Bathurst and Orange are certainly not anywhere near as devastating as those circumstances in northern New South Wales; nonetheless, there was a degree of concern by people because of the constant images that we were seeing night after night on television, where families were being shown to be in very desperate circumstances. I was pleased that the motion I moved in the federal parliamentary Labor caucus at the beginning of September suggesting that the government give consideration to easing the assets test on farmers in terms of social security and other income support payments and in respect of certain Austudy payments, in particular for tertiary Austudy payments, was overwhelmingly supported later that month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, on 21 September we saw the significant announcement by the cabinet which has been the subject of debate in the House both yesterday and today. The Prime Minister announced the provision of $164 million, including the new drought relief payment which is the principal element of the debate of yesterday and today, to help farm families who found themselves in these extreme and very desperate drought circumstances. Importantly, the announcement also extended to providing further reforms to rural adjustment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those measures were very warmly welcomed. I had a number of contacts with the New South Wales Farmers Association during the lead-up to the announcement of this package. I am sure many honourable members from both sides of the House received similar representations. There was also close liaison between the government and the principal organisation representing farmers in this country, the National Farmers Federation, which also played an important role. I recognise that both those organisations were extraordinarily complimentary of the government once those announcements were made. I think they were justifiably complimentary because, largely, the measures announced were the ones they were seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there will be circumstances where people fall just either side of measures. My friend and colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) during his contribution last evening made the very important point that whenever we draw lines on a map, whenever we have a situation where no state government is in a position to adequately define the nature of drought, we are going to end up with those difficult circumstances. If the desperate circumstances continue, I would ask the government for further refinements to be made that will ease perhaps any unintended consequences that may arise as a result of some areas that are clearly drought affected in rather exceptional circumstances currently falling outside the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important part of this measure is that the government wished to ensure that the assistance would flow very quickly to farm families, particularly to those most in need; hence, the criterion of 24 months out of 36 months should apply. We have seen during the course of this debate some toing-and-froing as to the relative merits of both sides of this House in terms of what the adequate criteria would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), pointed out during his contribution that perhaps some of his comments had been misinterpreted. I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, but, certainly in terms of the information I had available to me at the time, the situation was that in his press conference here on 31 August the member for Gwydir suggested that we should in fact look at two years out of the last five years or three years out of the last five years as the criteria for falling into the category of exceptional drought circumstances. Again, it gets back to the nature of definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate is surrounded by the difficulties we all have in coming together with an appropriate definition of extreme circumstances. More significantly, I can forgive and understand perhaps those comments made by the Deputy Leader of the National Party. But I find it very difficult to forget about the comments made by his state parliamentary colleague Mr Causley, the New South Wales minister for agriculture. Clearly, he sought to make a great deal of unfortunate political capital from the circumstances in which many people in rural Australia find themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were aware that a draft list of particularly affected districts was given to New South Wales officials by Commonwealth officials during the negotiation of this package. The circulation of the draft list wrongly created an expectation in some areas that persons would be entitled to special assistance. I know that Senator Collins has considerable regret that that occurred, but he made the important point that the final list&mdash;not the draft list&mdash;was signed by him only last Friday. The original list circulated in New South Wales by Minister Causley with the very large stamped draft gave high expectations, unfortunately, to the people in the western New South Wales Rural Lands Protection Boards districts of Coonabarabran, Coonamble, Dubbo, Mudgee, Nyngan and Walgett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noticed on that list the Rural Lands Protection Boards district of Grafton, which happens to coincide with the Legislative Assembly district that the minister represents. I am sure that, given the rather difficult circumstances the New South Wales government is facing&mdash;it is like a kangaroo in a country paddock with a spotlight in its eyes, going nowhere at the present time, with an election just a few months away&mdash;there was a very cynical attempt by that government, and the minister in particular, to use these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That aside, as a result of the debate over the last few weeks, particularly in the last few days, I think people understand where the government is coming from. I believe a genuine compassion has been exercised in relation to the circumstances in which people have found themselves. Importantly, the government and the Prime Minister in particular have given notice of future generous tax concessions that will be made available to people. While people are sometimes cynical of those sorts of comments, the time to focus people's attention on the issue of drought proofing is in the middle of difficult circumstances. As people sometimes say, the urgent always replaces the important, but this is a time when we need to consider long-term important decision making. I am sure that over the next few months, as the government begins to develop its package, we will again see progressive and sensible legislation coming forward from this government to address the particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I thank all members who are supportive of this bill. As we all know, while many farming families still find themselves in difficult circumstances, and while there is a total farm indebtedness in this country in excess of $17 billion, the long-term solution is drought breaking rain. We can only hope and pray that that comes sooner rather than later. But, importantly, in the circumstances that precede drought breaking rain, the drought relief package that forms part of this bill is a progressive step forward. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is particularly relevant that we have a debate in this House, albeit with only five of us present, on a subject that is absolutely fundamental to the survival of this country. Eighty per cent of New South Wales, about 40 per cent of Queensland&mdash;the figure is stretching day by day&mdash;something like 40 per cent of Victoria and, significantly, all consumers, are affected by drought. It could not be more appropriate to have the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) as the minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) in the House. Before my colleague the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) leaves the chamber, I inform him that I am glad that at a recent meeting at Dunedoo he recognised that one of the problems of the rural sector has been brought about by the economic malfeasance of the federal government. That is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not matter. It was as true then as it is now in 1994. I will talk a little about things of yesteryear in a moment. This parsimonious package before us today is trite in the extreme if we compare it with the generosity of coalition governments. If you look at where we are today and where Australia is going and dismiss altogether the recovery prospects of the rural sector, then you are failing to understand that, in this diverse nation of ours, just as multiculturalism might apply in demographic terms so does multifaceted industrial production apply in economic terms. It appals me that, because there is nothing better, people are saying what a great job the government has done with this package.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three things that need to be recognised to begin with. The first is the extent of the drought, and I have briefly referred to that. The second aspect is the alarming degree to which, as a result of the drought, the cattle kill is moving into the female herd. A few weeks ago it was about 40 per cent, two weeks ago it was 60 per cent, last week it had risen to 65 per cent, and before long it will be about 75 per cent. So we are not going to have females. It will take us about five years to recover, and when we recover we will have lost all those markets that lay behind the Uruguay Round negotiations within GATT which have been the prime focus of this government's trade policy for the last 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are about to move into a World Trade Organisation&mdash;we are moving away from the restraints of the past&mdash;and as we do so one of our principal achievements will have been destroyed. There will not be a cattle herd to generate the beef required to meet the markets that the Uruguay Round was designed to provide. So we have enormous problems to the extent that the basic herd has gone because the drought covers so much of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the drought that is important to understand is the fires that are breaking out alarmingly right down the east coast. They show dramatically how extensive the drought is. If you live in the town or the country you can see how dry your garden is, but the bush is tinder dry. The fires up and down the east coast have been horrific over the last few weeks, and the situation is getting worse. We all admire tremendously the efforts of those firefighters who were able to put out those alarming fires around the city of Sydney and elsewhere in New South Wales at the beginning of this year. But the year will get even worse. This is only October, and normally at this time of the year we are in the middle of a lush spring. The degree to which fire is starting to creep into this bushland of ours is appalling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things people need to understand about drought is the impact it has on people, the social fall-out that those of us who have bush seats know only too well. The drought will have real repercussions not just on houses, not just on the bush, but on people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not a day goes by when my office does not get somewhere between 20 and 100 calls from people in absolutely desperate straits. Unfortunately, things are getting worse. This package, although it is welcomed to the degree that it provides some help, does not provide help to the majority of those affected by the drought. I want to come to that in a moment. Sure, some will be helped by the changes to the assets test for Austudy&mdash;and I welcome that change, although the assets test should be totally removed from Austudy, as far as I am concerned. I certainly welcome the drought relief payment, which is the principal subject of this bill. But drought relief payment is not new; we have done it before. We have done it to help other farmers in similar conditions. We have given them access to social welfare payments. Of course there will be those who need to be helped in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the further measures under the rural adjustment scheme, but they are inadequate. As the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), demonstrates, there is absolutely nothing in the package for small business. I do not know whether government members have ever been to a country town, but if you walk down the street of any country town you will see closed shops and vacant premises and to let, to lease or for sale signs. They are not there because people want to get out. They are not moving of their own free will. They are going because there is no chance of survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are getting ghost towns around this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is out there talking about his magnificent new real estate, where he is going and having an argument with one of his predecessors in a manner that does him and his office little credit. He fails to understand that people in rural Australia are increasingly getting into a position where the services, professions and tradespeople&mdash;the people on whom they rely&mdash;are having to go because of the impact of economic conditions that eventuate with a protracted drought. There is no reason for the government to walk away from those people. They have as much right to live and make a living as the Prime Minister or anybody else in the government. Power does not mean the abuse of the responsibilities it brings; it means that you exercise those responsibilities on behalf of those in the community who have given you the opportunity for the time being to exercise that power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does this package bring? It brings $164 million over two years. Oh, gee! I was quite fascinated. That sounds like a lot of money&mdash;$82 million a year. I went back and had a look just to see what we did on earlier occasions. Let me talk about the social fallout; the consumer effect; the extent to which the breeding herds are disappearing; the degree to which there is a fire risk; the degree to which we are getting ghost towns; and the degree to which there is a family crisis, a social crisis, with families breaking up; the appalling number of suicides of young people; and the pressures on individuals, which this government just walks away from&mdash;it does not think it matters. People really ought to be thought of as needing care, attention and assistance. They have been dealt with by this crowd as though they do not matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reintroduced the States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Bill into this parliament 23 1/2 years ago. Then&mdash;money was worth a great deal more than it does today&mdash;for one aspect of aid alone we provided $100 million over four years for the rural reconstruction bill. Its provisions were a jolly sight more generous than anything that this government provides now, nearly quarter of a century later. It is interesting that the aim was not to displace private credit, not to relieve creditors of the consequences of commercial judgments that they made; rather, it was to provide help to those who have a chance, in a combined effort to retain in the industry as many producers as could possibly be placed on a sound basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of today is that we have to help as many producers as possible to stay in the industry. What does this package do? It provides social welfare relief. This package will help people to a degree. But the government fails to recognise that a lot more needs to be done. I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quarter of a century is a long time ago. Let us look at what has happened more recently. I refer to the speech that my colleague, the then Minister for Primary Industry and National Party member for Gippsland, made in this place on 16 September 1982 on the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill. The purpose of that bill was to give effect to the special Commonwealth drought assistance measures announced on 31 August 1982. There were two elements to that: a subsidy on interest payments over 12 per cent made by eligible drought declared farmers and a subsidy on fodder purchased to be fed to drought affected sheep and cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting part about that package is that there were a couple of elements within it that I think the government really needs to refer to: the amount of money provided and the way the government was prepared to recognise, as we did a quarter of a century ago, that this is a federation. If we want to keep producers in the industry, the way to do it is to work cooperatively with the states and try to give them help in the forms of assistance they provide under their own drought assistance packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been mentioned in this place that Queensland is providing help for small business. That is what our amendment is all about. But what is the government doing? It is ignoring it. The New South Wales government is giving significant assistance by providing water to properties and homes, moving drought affected stock and giving some assistance to freight by moving feed to that stock. I want to come back to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to recognise that in 1982, 12-odd years ago, $36 million was provided for the interest payment subsidy and $320 million for the fodder subsidy, the fodder relief program. Of course, it could be said that all that will do is drive fodder prices up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know where this lot have been. I am going to talk a little bit about their attitudes. On the amount of fodder available, they ought to understand that the Wheat Board has already published the amount of grain that is available in this country, and I think even the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has acknowledged that it will be essential to import grain. There is a world parity price on grain, and that is the ceiling beyond which you are not going to have to pay for grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excellent package that the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson) produced showed the way to the government. The government is so busy pursuing its own trivial interests. As I mentioned before, none of the government members are here in the House to worry about what goes on in the parliament. I doubt whether any of them even understood that the package the honourable member for Gwydir produced would have given primary producers a chance. The measures announced by the government help the bottom few per cent. They provide little money and little help; they are inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is absolutely ridiculous that the government does not try to do anything to preserve the breeding herd. Fifteen years ago the then Minister for Primary Industry produced a package which amounted to $320 million for the fodder subsidy and $36 million for an interest rate subsidy. That was in then money terms. Those opposite do not understand that that money has long since been repaid to the government and to the people of Australia by way of the enhanced earnings which were possible because the breeding herd was preserved and because people were able to stay on the farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Staying on the farm is another of my real concerns. I do not think the government has even addressed this issue. I was interested to look back to 5 May 1951 and to see what Dr Rex Patterson, the then member for Dawson in Queensland and the shadow spokesman on primary industry, said about the rural sector. On page 2586 of the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 5 May 1971 he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is the point in propping up producers who in the end will get further and further into debt? It would be far better to take a more progressive view and to phase these people out of production. Let us give them a chance to get out now before it is too late.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well. I read in the paper this morning that about 25 per cent of farmers are going to leave the land after the drought. The government does not seem to comprehend this situation. If we let people go from the land, we lose the principal powerhouse of this economy. Sure, it has changed but it is still a powerhouse which has contributed significantly and will contribute significantly, particularly in generating export earnings. With the most critical economic problem in this country being our chronic adverse balance of payments&mdash;the balance of payments deficit&mdash;what is the government doing? Not only is it letting one of the sectors that contribute to reversing that balance of payments wither on the vine; it is giving it a kick in the backside, and trying to get it out of they way as it does so. There are a lot of things that the government could do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come briefly to the positive elements. What is not here and what should be here? The first point is the amount of money. The government does not seem to understand this situation. If the Prime Minister can spend $2 1/2 million on a house at a fancy residential address in the heart of Sydney, why the devil can he not do better than provide $82 million a year to a few in the farming community who are going broke? Why can he not extend that money to help those in small business? There is talk about ghost towns. They are not some sort of a dreamtime concept. They are there&mdash;the vacant premises, the vacant shopfronts, the vacant business houses. People are walking away; they have got no chance of survival. What does this crowd opposite do? It walks away and ignores them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first thing we have to do is provide additional money to help those in small business so that they can stay there. We can help them to cover their debts. Their debts are rising. The number of creditors is rising. Small businesses are not meeting their bills month by month. Of course it is happening. There is no other way they are able to cover their credit. There is a problem with the capacity of the average creditor in the country being able to meet liabilities to lending institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have been critical of the banks in various ways. I am most concerned about the way in which the penalty interest rate increment applies. If we had something like the interest rate subsidy that Peter Nixon introduced in 1982, we might be able to overcome these circumstances. Those who are worse off in the rural sector, those who are trying to borrow money to buy feed, would be allowed to continue to operate their accounts on a viable basis. Sure, time and circumstances have changed. It is true that you could say, `In those days interest rates were 12 per cent and today they are lower.' I commend the government for the fact that interest rates are lower, but they are still disproportionately higher than those paid by most of our competitors. As far as the banks are concerned, an interest rate subsidy would enable us to overcome some of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the third element that is quite noticeably absent. As I suggested before, the government should understand that the states themselves have a role in natural disaster relief. Queensland is introducing a scheme to help small businesses. I have identified what the New South Wales government is doing, and I commend it for doing that, but its financial resources are limited. I believe something is being done in Victoria too, although I am not sure of the detail. The important point is that this government must do more than just talk about drought relief in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen the appalling consequences of the present drought. The honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) gave an excellent speech yesterday when he identified the implications of six rural lands protection boards which were previously to be included in this scheme now being excluded because of some calculations that have been made. To make it even worse, even if the drought goes on for another month or two, they are not going to be brought within the scheme. It is quite ridiculous to have a very narrow definition of those areas which are to receive any benefit from this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside, it is important to understand that the states too have a role. The federal government could very easily and, in my view, must provide for a natural disaster scheme which includes drought. The definition now prevailing, which excludes those six rural lands protection boards, must be redefined. It is absolutely inequitable to exclude those who believed they were going to be included and who have suffered inordinately. That is the product of an arbitrary decision. Whether it was made by the bureaucrats or the minister, I would not know, but it has certainly meant that people are being inequitably excluded. They should not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next element in my positive program is that the government must make sure it works with the states in developing a reasonable way to help the states with their programs. Some areas where help can be given are already apparent. There is a limit of 1,500 kilometres on the grain subsidy for New South Wales. It is a lot further than 1,500 kilometres to bring lupins or grain across the continent from Western Australia. There is a limit of $15,000. The longer the drought goes on the more people are going over that limit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government should say that, after a minimal expenditure by the state government, it is prepared to provide funds to help in drought relief measures that can be agreed on between the states at the Australian Agricultural Council. Goodness only knows it was done every year till about two years ago. What the devil is the matter with this crowd? Can those opposite not go out and make agreements? Can they not understand there is a role they can play? That element ought to be in this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another form of assistance I noted yesterday might help too. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">CashCrop</EMPHASIS> magazine produced by the Australian Wheat Board, I noticed a paragraph headed `Grain for equity' written by Ted Laskie, the New South Wales State Manager of the Wheat Board. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you're in a drought-declared area, then you can use your remaining equity in the 1992-93 pools to buy feed grain from the AWB.</PARA>
<PARA>What a great benefit it would be if people could get some equity on the grain they were going to deliver not to the 1994-95 pools, for many will not be delivering very much, but to the 1995-96 pools when the drought breaks. Grain growers could reasonably be allowed to borrow from the pool for an amount of grain proportional to that which they have delivered over a number of years so they might buy grain at a reasonable price from the Wheat Board, not for cash but on terms, to enable them to feed their livestock. No doubt federal government help would be required to do it. That is another form of assistance the government could provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package helps at the bottom end. It is great that the government is doing something but, for goodness sake, can it not get off its backside and understand how serious the problem is? The government's response is inadequate. A great deal more needs to be done and could be done if the government only had the sense, the sensitivity and the sensibility to do it. </PARA>

I am pleased to see the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) in the chamber because I wanted to make some points in this debate that he may be interested in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the issues of fodder subsidies and the national herd. These issues have been raised by National Party members, particularly the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), and they are of considerable concern. The other issue that the member for New England raised is why we are not consulting with the state governments. We did. An agreement was reached in 1992 that we would have a national drought policy, not a disaster relief fund, because it was no longer seen adequate as a means of effectively managing drought in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons why we have moved away from the idea of fodder subsidies are that they discourage the self-reliance provisions of the national drought policy, they encourage overstocking and they create land degradation pressures at a time of drought. The main beneficiaries of the subsidies are transporters and fodder suppliers. The subsidies are not based on an assessment of need and are inequitable across industries. For instance, they provide little or no help to grain farmers in drought areas. It is typical that we hear a great deal of breast-beating from the members opposite but not particularly constructive suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns raised by my colleagues opposite is the effect the drought is having on the national herd. This is obviously of importance to this country, as the member for New England said, for our balance of payments. It is vital that we maintain our national breeding stock. Let us look at what has happened over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland sheep flock is now slightly larger than it was during the last major drought. The significant decline in numbers from 1991 is in response to the decline in wool prices as well as the dry conditions. The declines have been similar for wethers, down by 22 per cent, and for ewes, down by 25 per cent. The sharp decline in wool prices means that we cannot attribute the decline in sheep numbers only to drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the beef industry, which is very important in my electorate. Since 1981, the female beef herd in Queensland has been in excess of 4.2 million head, growing to 4.8 million head in 1993. Since the end of March 1993, the female herd has declined to 4.6 million head&mdash;a decline in 1993 of only five per cent. Members should note that these figures are as at 31 March each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen a massive decline in the national herd. I think it is very important to note that, during this period, we have seen improved fertilisation techniques. I inform the House that my husband is working at the animal genetic breeding unit in the member for New England's electorate. That unit is working very hard with producer organisations to make sure that we improve the genetic mix of both the national beef cattle and pig herds so that we have an effective product, particularly for the export market. While it is extremely worrying and very distressing for farmers to make decisions to reduce stock numbers on their properties, it is essential if we are to have environmentally sound land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to an article in Saturday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> about Dr Dean Graetz, a CSIRO scientist. He was very critical of our farm management techniques and was pilloried by a number of people for saying something that I believe is very important. The challenge of this drought is not only for the government to provide direct relief, which is the import of the bill before us today, but also for our rural organisations, producers, government and scientific organisations to address how we are going to manage our breeding program in the rural industries in the face of the very dry climate we have in this country. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Every time I read a story about someone who has had their fourth crop fail, or whatever, I know there is a farmer who has not made sound business decisions," Dr Graetz said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The article further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Graetz was aware that what he said was bitter medicine for many pastoralists and was aware of the agony evident in many families.</PARA>
<PARA>Although he is now studying climate change in Canberra, he has previously worked in western Queensland on land degradation and in the Division of Wildlife and Ecology. So it is not as though he is, as was suggested, a Canberra bureaucrat. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But he insisted that drought was a manifestation of a wider problem&mdash;a lack of management skills in the rural community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"One local paper had a story about a grazier spending $1,000 a week hand-feeding sheep," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The sheep weren't of good quality and so could never return enough to get him out of the debt he's getting into. So where is the sound business decision?</PARA>
<PARA>It is very important for rural producers to face these very difficult facts in these circumstances. One of the reasons there ought to be a decline in the national breeding herd at a time of drought is that we have to maintain the environmental integrity of the country. There are indeed many areas of this country which are marginal. The areas will need to be reassessed as to whether even dry farming should take place in those areas. These are the hard decisions that we are going to have to make if we are going to look after our country. The National Party leadership was over a period of years guiding the rural fortunes of this country, and we have now got the benefit of that leadership with environmental degradation in many areas of this country&mdash;the Murray-Darling basin, to name one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to counter the idea that this is an exceptional drought in a long-term climatic sense. Coral samples taken from the Great Barrier Reef indicate that the norm in our country's long history is to have many years of drought&mdash;not two or three or four bad seasons, but as many as 16 years of drought. Obviously, none of us look forward to that prospect with any sense of positiveness. We have to face the fact that the recent history of our country may have been the abnormal. While we expanded land use and developed what has been a very important rural industry in this country at a time when commodity prices were high, when it was very easy for us to make a good living off the sheep's back and off the back of our increasingly effective cattle herd, we are now facing the fact that we are going to have to look at these issues very carefully. This bill aims to help those efficient producers. The Prime Minister said in his speech on 21 September that we were not going to leave the rural people behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate what I said in the Main Committee on 21 September, the day the package was released. I might add it was also my birthday.

Indeed, my comments were taken up in the MPI on the following day by my colleagues the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) and the member for Calare (Mr Simmons). We were putting not just our view on the coalition's policy but the views of rural organisations and the press in this country. I refer to some of the comments made by people in response to the government's rural relief package. The Australian Council of Social Service on 21 September said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a strong, creative and positive response to these calls for actions. This much needed initiative will be applauded by the whole Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>Lex Buchanan from the Queensland Farmers Federation said on radio 4BC that he was very pleased with the package. National Farmers Federation President, Mr Donald McGauchie, said on 21 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Collins, backed by Mr Keating, has done a good job for the farm sector. Both have our sincere thanks. Overall, today's package is a positive Commonwealth response to severe drought in the eastern states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ian Macfarlane, the President of the Grains Council of Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government . . . The Prime Minister and Senator Collins had stood by their commitment to help drought stricken farmers. These commitments, given during recent drought tours&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I was on that central Queensland tour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had given the rural community great expectations, which have now been met.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said in an interview on 4QR:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . PM and Bob Collins have done an extraordinary job in assisting drought-stricken farmers . . . quite outstanding . . . far better than (we) could have hoped for . . . closed off no avenues . . . gave a clear message there is hope . . .  farmers can look forward to the future . . . you have to give credit where credit is due.</PARA>
<PARA>This did not come from the ACTU or me: it came from peak farm organisations. John Crawford from the New South Wales Farmers Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very significant step . . . The government has taken an extraordinary step . . . a giant leap forward to solving a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister is to be applauded. With regards to the fodder subsidy proposed by the opposition: Flynn said it had been rorted in the past and that's probably why the government wouldn't not go for it.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 22 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All reasonable people will applaud the drought relief package but especially the decision to abolish the assets test for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>So across the board the government has been applauded for its efforts in this area and that has made it very difficult for the opposition to be positive. There is no doubt that it is very difficult for oppositions to oppose positively. When the Executive Officer of the National Farmers Federation, Rick Farley, wrote an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 26 September, the difficulties for the opposition continued. Mr Farley has been roundly criticised by the National Party and the opposition in general for his support on Mabo and other matters. This is an example of where, unfortunately, peak rural lobby organisations are far ahead of the opposition parties on rural policy. Mr Farley said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP has been picking up support in regional Australia over the past 10 years&mdash;partly as a result of demographic changes&mdash;and now holds almost as many regional seats as the coalition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's trip to drought areas in Queensland, leading up to the drought package, was remarkably successful. The fact that the package includes some of the proposals put directly to him at that time has not gone unnoticed. Keating is now in the position of being able to say: `We came, we saw, we listened, we acted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably the case that not many farmers would consider changing their vote in response. The real benefit to the ALP could be in the regional towns and cities, where local businesses are badly affected by decimated farm income. Any improvement in farmers' cash flow will have a direct benefit there and that's where the swinging voters are.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that this article was not particularly well received by the opposition parties. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 1 and 2 October, Tim Stevens, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Downer, Liberal Party federal director Mr Andrew Robb and former Liberal leader Mr Malcolm Fraser have all attacked the NFF, either publicly or privately in phone calls with Mr McGauchie who, like Mr Anderson&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the honourable member for Gwydir, I might add&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is trying to calm everyone down.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to the coalition's comments, Tim Stevens said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response, an NFF source said `The problem with the coalition is that they haven't come to grips with not being in government. We don't need them and certainly we don't want them until they get their policy act together. Besides, despite all this bickering, we are still far softer with them than we are with Labor.'</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the opposition finds itself between a rock and a hard place. It is therefore difficult for excellent members like the member for Wakefield, who always speaks with concern, care, consideration and fairness in this House. But I felt it a requirement on myself to bring to the notice of the House this widespread criticism of opposition policies. We have not been about a knee-jerk reaction. Our policy has not been in response to a media campaign, as suggested by my colleague the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), who continues to bleat about the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that the amendment to this bill that is before us today is the last gasp attempt by the opposition to salvage some credibility. We listened to the concerns of small business. They were put directly to the Prime Minister and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and to me and to the many other members of the government who have been out there consulting with people in the bush. We have a large constituency out there in rural and regional Australia. We did not just knee-jerk this reaction. This is a considered policy response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial assistance available in this package will have a significant flow-on effect to the small business sector in rural and regional Australia. We will see that pick up once farmers have the money to spend. They will be able to go out and spend that money locally. There is a disappointing aspect to the well meaning assistance provided by city people to country people. Busloads of bread and basic things landed in country towns in a well meaning, though unthought out, attempt to provide help. It caused major problems to small business people, who were carrying large debts on behalf of farming families. We have made sure that our policy will assist those people through the flow-on effect. I believe that we will see that sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that, between the normal RAS and the increase in exceptional circumstances RAS, rural industries already have access to another $660 million of resources because they will be able to manage their loans. What this policy is about is making sure that those efficient, effective, viable farming producers will be able to withstand what is a very difficult drought in many areas of the country. It may not be the most exceptional if we look back 200, 300 or 400 years, but it certainly has been a difficult drought. The challenge now for the government, working together with rural producers, is to put in place a set of policies for long-term investment options that will make sure that we do not allow inefficient, unviable producers to go out onto marginal country further degrading that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must protect our viable producers so that the rural industries will continue to provide an important part of our export opportunities. At the same time we will not leave any other areas of the community behind. That was the thing that most impressed the people who met with the Prime Minister at Timbaroo. They saw someone who was caring. They got past the media image of the Prime Minister when he said to them very directly, `We will not leave the rural people of this country behind.' They thought, `There is hope here.' This drought relief package is an embodiment of that commitment. This government consults with people, with state governments, with the industries concerned and with the people at the grassroots and has delivered an excellent package. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) in this debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill. I acknowledge her generous remarks relating to previous debates on rural issues, in which we seem to constantly be scheduled to follow one other. I do, however, think that she is being a little less than fair by suggesting that the opposition has been excessively critical about the drought package of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I remind her of the remarks of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who preceded her in the debate and welcomed the drought package. Most of the opposition press releases that I have seen since the release of the drought package indicate that the opposition has recognised the need for this package and has welcomed the welfare measures contained therein.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not have the documentation at my fingertips, I well recall the shadow minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), indicating that much of the package announced by Senator Collins reflected the very things that he, as shadow minister, had 10 days earlier indicated would be in a drought package if the opposition were in a position to be the government. I think that the opposition has been much more accommodating about this package than the remarks of the honourable member for Capricornia indicated. I concede that in the Main Committee there was a debate over the comments Mr Stevens had made in relation to the opposition's drought package. Most of that debate, however, was over the impression of division over the drought package between the Liberal and National parties that Mr Stevens had sought to draw rather than over the context of the government's package as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In participating in this debate this morning, I acknowledge that I, along with other members of the opposition, am grateful for the action the government has taken with the drought package. Our criticism has been the criticism that always comes from oppositions, and I think in this case it is valid. It is this: while the package is welcome it is too little, as indicated by the right honourable member for New England in his comments. He pointed out that, when he was in government, in 1982 $320 million was made available for fodder subsidy and $36 million was made available for household support. This compares rather favourably with the government's present offer of something like $82 million per annum, or $162 million in total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has not commented that the action by the government is not welcome but that what the government has done&mdash;as is often the case with governments&mdash;is too little, too late. The bind we as a nation face is that we have not faced a national disaster such as this since 1982. In 1982, a nationwide drought, gripping not only Queensland and northern New South Wales but also Western Australia and much of South Australia, was one of the major factors in forcing the Fraser government from office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem that the opposition sees with the government's drought package is not that there is anything specifically wrong with the package but that, as has been said by previous opposition speakers, the drought package offers a welfare measure for farmers&mdash;which is welcome&mdash;but does little to keep in place the flocks and herds which will be necessary when the drought breaks and we look once again to agriculture generating some real export assistance and doing something to address our disastrous balance of payments problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to reinforce the points made by the right honourable member for New England. We are facing a situation where&mdash;thanks to government and opposition cooperation on the question of the GATT and on trade generally and thanks to the outcome of the Uruguay Round&mdash;it is reasonable to expect that in a good season Australia will face firmer wool prices and dramatically better beef prices. It is also reasonable to expect firmer wheat prices. Feed prices for stock will consequently rise, which will cause a real dilemma in how to go about restocking drought stricken Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, the opposition has not only welcomed these welfare measures but said that we need to have some reasonable form of fodder subsidy and some capacity either to get feed to some desperately hungry livestock or to get livestock out of that situation and to where the feed is presently located. Clearly, the cost of moving feed to livestock or livestock out of a drought stricken area is beyond the resources of farmers for whom cash is already scarce. For that reason, the opposition has called on the government not only to implement these well farm measures but also to recognise the need to preserve the nation's stocks and herds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Capricornia was understandably concerned about what she saw as the potential for land degradation in the face of a drought. We all know that. I have to say, though, that droughts are rarely good for land. Farmers do not tend to keep stock running over land that is already desperately drought stricken because there simply is not the water available to sustain that stock. In the face of a drought, most farmers move into some sort of feedlotting situation so that the stock are not moving far for water but are located close to a water point and so the feed is either brought to the stock or, as I said, the stock and herds are totally relocated to another part of the nation where some feed is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are proposing does not in any sense add to land degradation; in fact, the opposition's proposals minimise the land degradation that is characteristically a part of drought in Australia and allows us to ensure that stock are not moving over land that has no feed on it and travelling large distances to find what little feed is available. That does not last long. They soon consume it. You then have a situation in which the stock simply have nowhere to travel because there is simply no feed and the stock will die. Instead of that, most farmers centralise a water point and provide some form of feedlotting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the point of the honourable member for Capricornia that, in many ways, there has been increased land degradation in Australia as a result of coalition policies. I have observed that, in my electorate, in the last two decades land degradation has been less and less a characteristic of rural Australia&mdash;no matter what the season. Much of my electorate is made up of the Mallee sections of South Australia, some of the driest and most unpredictable parts of rural Australia. I can take anyone to the Wanbi Research Centre, where they will see a great deal of work that has been done by farmers and the department of agriculture in difficult drought-like conditions to ensure that the sandhills, which were always so much a characteristic part of the Mallee and which, since the Mallee had been cleared, had been increasingly encroaching into productive agricultural land, are now held in check. The sandhills are held in check by the very careful use of farming techniques, by increasing chemical tillage, by ensuring that stocks of rye, generally, are sown on those sandhills at appropriate times to keep them in place, by making sure that they are not stopped and grazed in their fragile condition and by making sure that they have been appropriately fenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contend that, for much of Australia, the real problem of land degradation as a result of agricultural activity is dramatically less than it was two decades ago. That is a great credit to every farmer because those two decades have seen some very difficult years in terms of drought and in terms of commodity prices. In the face of this much has been done, not only in the Mallee section of my electorate but in the west coast part of South Australia, to ensure that land is now kept in place and that persistent dry seasons do not see the level of dust storms that once characterised agriculture in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the west coast of South Australia. I think we ought to pay tribute by the role played by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), who represents what has to be the most drought afflicted part of South Australia. I spent some time in his electorate 10 days ago, viewing some of the worst drought afflicted areas around Ceduna. It is obvious that the honourable member for Grey not only has a real rapport with the farmers of the area but, having been and continuing to be a farmer in that area himself, understands precisely what they need. It is fair to comment that, in the context of this particular drought package, there is nothing for those farmers on the west coast of South Australia who are currently facing a drought. The honourable member for Grey, in his responsible role, does not claim that there should be a large portion of this package directed to his farmers, even though they are in the grip of a drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition recognises that dry seasons are characteristically a part of agricultural Australia, that every farmer has an obligation to prepare for dry seasons and that only in three or four dry seasons&mdash;such as we have seen in northern New South Wales and Queensland&mdash;has it been appropriate for there to be federal government intervention, as has occurred with this drought package. However, I point out that the farmers represented by the honourable member for Grey face an extraordinary situation. He has already, I am sure, made this patently clear to the House in previous debates, as he has to the party room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficult situation his farmers face is that, while this is the first year of severe drought they have had, over the last three years they have faced a calamity. In one year, there was too much rain at harvest time, so effectively they harvested nothing and what they did harvest was available only for feed. On another occasion, so intrusive was a plague of mice that a great deal of damage was done to the ripening crop and to much of what had subsequently been harvested. So, in many ways, the farmers in this area face three years of dramatically poor income and effectively three years of drought, even though it has been raining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is fair to say that what the government has failed to do in recognising the needs of Australian farmers is allow Australian farmers to prepare for the sort of calamity that is characteristic of farming. What the opposition has been critical of, and I think rightly so, is that the government has been too slow to pick up those sorts of initiatives that ought to be in place for every farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic illustration of the way in which farmers are able to prepare for difficult seasons that characterise rural Australia, not for a situation like that in Queensland and northern New South Wales, is the provision of effective and viable income equalisation deposits. I think there is a real case to be made for the government looking again at its IED scheme&mdash;looking at the tax arrangements that apply when IEDs are set aside, at the interest rates that apply to IEDs and at the tax arrangements that apply when IEDs are called on in years of low income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The challenge the government faces if it is to encourage farmers to anticipate the difficult seasons such as the farmers in the electorate of Grey are currently experiencing is that of providing farmers with a real incentive to provide for low income years. This is a policy area that needs investigation by those on both sides of the House, but it may be that IEDs should apply to a broader band than merely farmers, given, as the opposition amendment suggests, that droughts also impinge severely on not only the farmers in a community but also the small businesses which are so dependent on those farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the opposition's amendment and its impact on small business that I would like to address the House on briefly in these remarks. While I toured the drought stricken area of the electorate of Grey I spent some time in the town of Wudinna. In Wudinna in South Australia, to the great credit of all the farmers there, who are facing their third year of low income, they were not facing the member for Grey and me suggesting that we should be badgering the government for some additional handout. They were saying, `We would like greater opportunity to take those farmers in Wudinna who are unable to survive and  keep them in the community of Wudinna so that Wudinna survives, and all other little rural communities survive, even though they may not be farming.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks to an action by the present federal government, Wudinna has in place a telecentre, a modern communication facility that allows access to all sorts of information on computer terminals, with someone who understands how to drive a computer. The computer terminal is located at a convenient place in the town so any community organisation can go and communicate and get information on a range of activities, even a TAFE course if necessary, which is effectively fed into the centre of the town of Wudinna. They welcomed that and they were making this telecentre work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the people in the town of Wudinna pointed out to both the member for Grey and me was that the real difficulty in keeping people in Wudinna and keeping the rural community of Wudinna&mdash;or any other rural community in any other rural electorate&mdash;alive in the face of falling incomes was in actually having something other than farming for people to do in Wudinna. They said that, thanks to the telecentre, they have brought in farmers who clearly have real skills&mdash;in steel prefabrication, in mechanics, in management and, in some cases, salesmanship as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason for them not to be cultivating steel prefabricating or management skills or developing all sorts of alternative rural enterprises in Wudinna other than that the cost of production in Wudinna makes it so prohibitive for them to get started. Part of the challenge that I think the government faces therefore, if it is serious about a real package that addresses the needs of rural Australia and allows rural Australia to prepare for the sort of unpredictability that characterises rural Australia, as the member for Capricornia has insisted, is that of addressing seriously the cost of production that characterises rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that the proposal advanced by the opposition in the last election, which was simply to take the cost of transport in rural Australia and prune it dramatically by making the excise on fuel refundable to those who were using it in business, was not picked up by the government? If we could reduce both the unreasonable cost of employing people in rural Australia, not by being exploitative clearly but by freeing up the industrial relations sector, and the unreal cost of transport in and out of rural Australia, we would do something to allow businesses to set up alternative enterprises in regional centres in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the amendment currently before the House is to call on the government to recognise that any drought that directly affects farmers, particularly those in Queensland and northern New South Wales, indirectly affects industries in rural Australia, indirectly affects those who are in all sorts of enterprises related to farming but not covered by this drought package. The real challenge the government faces is in recognising that we do not want more centralisation in Australia. We do not want more people moving to the cities and out of rural areas. We want people staying in rural areas. If it is not efficient and profitable for them to be in farming, then it may be to conduct a business in a rural area. The unfair cost of those businesses is one of the things that the government could address with an imaginative package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought package announced by Senator Collins contains a great deal in the way of welfare measures that have been welcomed by the opposition. What it fails to do is keep in place both the businesses, covered by the opposition's amendment, and the flocks and herds needed by efficient farmers if, when the drought breaks, they are to continue to make a contribution to addressing the balance of payments crisis this nation has. The opposition has called on the government through its amendment and through its speeches to recognise the need businesses have in rural Australia and to recognise the opportunity that will have to be there for farmers to restock when this drought breaks if any sort of drought package is in fact to be comprehensive. I commend the amendment to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the government amendments to the Farm Household Support Act to provide drought relief payments to farmers in exceptional circumstances due to extreme drought. It is a terrible situation that many families are facing at present in our country. The underlying principle of the national drought policy agreement agreed by the Commonwealth and all states in July 1992 was that climatic variability is a normal feature of the Australian farming environment to be managed along with the other risks associated with farm businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under normal conditions good farm managers should be in a position to draw on accumulated risk management reserves. The exceptional circumstances provisions are intended to assist in those circumstances for which a good manager could not be expected to prepare. The drought package is targeted at farmers in extreme drought, those that could not be expected to factor such a situation into their risk planning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has recently varied the guidelines so that instead of two years continuous drought being considered exceptional circumstances it is now 24 out of 36 months. This is to cater for farmers who had dry years in 1991 and 1992 and, although currently droughted, actually had good crops last year. This has allowed more farmers on the mainland of Australia to qualify for these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a very difficult problem to deal with as everyone in every state has someone whom they believe should be covered by exceptional circumstances. Therefore, the formula has been amended to try to make sure those most severely affected were and are covered. Certain areas of Tasmania have had some extreme conditions where farmers have faced great difficulties. It was enough for the state government in Tasmania, along with representatives from various groups such as the Tasmania Farmers and Graziers Association, the Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries and Tasmania Development and Resources, to develop a drought strategy working group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Tasmanian situation is never likely to be as bad as that of the mainland, there are still farmers in very difficult circumstances. Drought varies from region to region and there should be some recognition of this in the definition of exceptional circumstances. I will be seeking to address this through the caucus primary industry committee, of which I am a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State minister Robin Gray met with Senator Collins and other state ministers to agree on the drought relief guidelines. All states agreed on the guidelines mentioned above, but some believed there was a need to take into account the different drought situations. But, whatever we say or measure, it is very hard to equate the Tasmanian situation with that of northern New South Wales and Queensland. That situation has reached horrific proportions that belong to famine plagued countries, and assistance must be given and given very quickly. That is what this bill is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Tasmanians are also facing difficulties, and I would not wish on them the conditions facing those people for whom the main part of this assistance is targeted, but people must not think that Tasmania has missed out from rural assistance. I have been working very hard with this government on a number of programs geared for rural communities. RAP is one of the government's major mechanisms for providing assistance to community groups, industry associations and educational institutions to plan and deliver projects to solve local problems. These projects are designed to improve rural people's access to services and opportunities, including health, education, training, information and social services. This program, although not huge, has been useful for many people. Funding provided over the last two years totalled $61,416. Four of these projects have been in my electorate of Lyons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the Tasmanian Rural Counselling Service. There are two rural financial counsellors employed by the Tasmanian Rural Counselling Service under the government program. Grants have been allocated from the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio of $138,600 in 1994-95. Rural counsellors provide free and confidential advice to farming families experiencing difficulties for the purpose of assessing the farm financial position in identifying options for the future. This includes the core activities of these regions, which are, after all, in the primary industry areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leading on from that is the rural adjustment scheme, the purpose of which is to provide support for long-term viable farmers to improve their farm productivity and profitability, and to determine whether it is sustainable. It will also look at upgrading farm businesses and property management skills or assist farmers leaving the farm altogether. It is in this area where assistance in exceptional circumstances would apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> To receive RAS assistance, each applicant has a number of factors taken into account in determining prospects of sustainable long-term profitability: the capacity to access commercial finance, the capacity of the farm enterprise to become financially independent of RAS support, the level of non-farm assets, the level of non-farm income and the proportion of labour contributed to the farm enterprise. Commonwealth RAS expenditure in 1993-94 for Tasmania was $3.6 million, compared with total Commonwealth expenditure to all states of $150.3 million. The Commonwealth's allocation to Tasmania for RAS in 1994-95 is $2.7 million, compared with a total Commonwealth allocation to the states of about $108 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania approved 96 applicants for normal RAS support in 1993-94, an approval rate of 90 per cent. Of the approvals, 14 were for productivity enhancement interest rate subsidies, 17 for training grants, 59 for professional advice and six for re-establishment. It is seen that the most effective way to assist rural communities is to support the base on which they rest. All these programs are geared to look at the wider problem, the multiplier effects and implications for a region if the primary economic resource is suffering. We have seen how this works in the forest industries in Tasmania and now, to a lesser extent, in the farming area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are long-term programs&mdash;they have been in place for some time now&mdash;which have been assisting farmers and their families during that time. I fully support the package that has been developed for farmers in those really hard-hit areas. I also commend the minister and his predecessors for their foresight in seeing that we need to change the way in which farming is approached in Australia. We need to promote a better financial, technical management performance from the farm sector. This includes the improvement of farm risk management, with drought being one of the risks to be managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw in my local press only today that, in some areas of Tasmania, the farms which have large areas of native grasses are surviving the drought much better than properties that have a high proportion of improved pastures. This sort of knowledge that is starting to come forward should be utilised within programs to enable us to assist our farming community. It is like the concern being expressed for the future of landcare programs. It would be a shame to see those programs left behind, but one can realise the difficulties in being enthusiastic when one is battling to survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is on the record as saying that the government would look at the taxation scheme with a view to providing further assistance to the rural sector. I hope that area can be utilised through improving land and looking at native grass planting or the planting of shelter belts. In Tasmania's southern midlands and on our east coast, we face great difficulties in maintaining the eucalypt trees that are scattered throughout the farming areas. I hope we can follow through on that matter and maybe use the taxation system in some way in the future to improve the viability and the new way of looking at farming in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I guess that is what RAS is all about: learning to understand drought and drier periods, and learning to come to grips with a new way of looking at the whole area of farming. One of the disappointments in listening to the other side in this debate is its failure to come to grips with the new way of looking at farming in Australia. We have to understand why some of that happens, what can be done to limit the damage, how to wait out a reasonable period without too many unhappy consequences. So it is management, managing skills, attaining skills and risk management&mdash;all those things. I guess, even if we do that, there will still be exceptional circumstances&mdash;times when there is nothing to be done but provide direct assistance to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With better knowledge and better management, hopefully fewer will require this assistance. After all, our strengths in Australia come from being smarter and being able to outthink our competitors. I guess we should see drought and dry periods as competitors, and we should use our skills to take on that challenge and to improve ourselves. That will happen only by looking at things differently, acting differently, moving down a different way of thinking and changing our culture from the way we have done things in the past. I support the amendments. I certainly wish all those people who will gain some assistance from the bill the best in the hard times that they are experiencing. I wish them well in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In her speech, the honourable member for Capricornia quoted a number of experts in rural management. She said that the drought is the farmers' fault and that their current financial situation is their fault. That is the most extraordinary assertion from a person who is paid by the taxpayers to represent one of the bigger rural seats in Australia. I deeply regret that some people of that area had the misfortune to vote for her at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) recently returned from one of his many jaunts overseas, he said that he was very pleased to say that Australia is no longer a quarry or some sort of extended sheep run. It was a dreadful statement; you could hear the vituperative venom dripping from his voice. When I heard this comment it was early in the morning and I thought to myself, `That's really it; this bloke really hates those people out there who are not in the big densely populated cities of Australia&mdash;the people who work in the mining and farming industries in Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's recommendations on the tobacco industry, which are most relevant to this debate, say that the farmers are non-competitive. That statement of the Industry Commission was correct, but it inferred that it was the farmers' fault that they were not competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state to the House that, yes, the farmers are not competitive&mdash;but they face many farm costs. The first farm cost is interest rates, and I do not know any farmer whose interest rates are below 11 per cent. The last time I looked the official business interest rates were 9.5 per cent. I think they are pretty close to 10 per cent now. When they were at 9.5 per cent, interest rates in the United States, our biggest international farm competitor, were six per cent. So our first farm cost was 50 per cent higher than that of our major competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second farm cost is labour costs. We should not be ashamed or condemnatory&mdash;I think we should be proud&mdash;of the fact that our farm labour costs are $8 an hour whereas in California, for example, they are $4 an hour. The last time I cited that figure I was corrected and told that the Queensland industrial court had put farm labour costs up to over $11 an hour. I do not know whether that is correct or not. That is the second cost input item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third cost input item for agricultural production in Queensland is water. The incoming socialist government of Mr Goss put water charges up from about $3 a megalitre to $30 a megalitre. Our competitor, California&mdash;and it has to carry its water about 200 or 300 kilometres on average to the farm gate; we have to carry our water about 30 kilometres in Queensland&mdash;charges $3.90 a megalitre for water. So there is a 1,000 per cent difference in the third cost item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth cost item is fertiliser. Urea costs $396 a tonne in Australia; it costs $203 a tonne in the United States. The final cost item is fuel. A litre of diesel fuel costs 25c a litre in the United States. In Australia, even when taxation is deducted, diesel fuel costs 42c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To condemn the farmers for this situation is ludicrous and reprehensible in the extreme. The farmer has absolutely no control over interest rates. Interest rates are set by the federal government. The head of the Reserve Bank and the Prime Minister have made comments along those lines. The Prime Minister said, `We set the interest rates.' It is a statement that I think he regrets having made, but the head of the Reserve Bank does not regret those comments. Anyone who knows anything knows that interest rates are set by the federal government. So that is a farm cost imposed by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second cost, labour, is also imposed by the government. The arbitration commission and industrial courts decide what we will pay for farm labour; it is not under the control of the farmer. The third farm input cost in the state of Queensland is water for irrigation, and I imagine that the situation would be the same in New South Wales. So irrigation costs are also controlled by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two farm costs were fertiliser and fuel. There is something dreadfully wrong with the trade practices laws in Australia when we have a monopolistic pricing mechanism in Australia where, although world oil prices have dropped clean in half over the last 10 years, fuel prices have doubled here in Australia in the same period. Clearly, there is a dreadful problem with monopolistic pricing practices in Australia. There is no legislation on the books to cope with fertiliser, where there is no competition, or petrol, where there appears to be no effective competition whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation in Australia where the three major cost input items are between 50 and 1,000 per cent higher than those of our nearest competitor, the United States, which is a high cost structured country. Those three costs are imposed by the government. The farmer has absolutely no control over those costs. If you want to know why those costs have been allowed to go up in the way that they have, you need look no further than the most unpleasant statements made by the honourable member for Capricornia and the Prime Minister of Australia. They simply do not like farmers. I can say nothing other than that this government has launched upon a policy which positively seeks if not to destroy the owner-operator farms in Australia then to at least take a position of callous neglect which will enable them to go under. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Farley, in an article which has been referred to on a number of occasions, condemned the National Party and the Liberal Party. The National Party in my state removed death duties, and that is probably worth the family farm. The next generation would simply not get the farm in our day and age if it were not for those death duties having been removed. We did that. Mr Farley accused us of being non-achievers. Let me name a few of our achievements that come to mind. We set up the Agricultural Bank; the QIDC; the PIBA; the AIDC, which was very helpful but I do not have time to explain why; the Rural Reconstruction Board; and the Commonwealth Development Bank. All of those institutions were set up to enable money to be borrowed at certain concessional rates of interest by the farming community. In every other crisis that farmers have faced in Australia this century, they have received assistance from mechanisms of that type. This is the first time that we have gone into a crisis situation and assistance has not been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Farley, the representative of the NFF, condemned us. We put those institutions into practice; we preserved the farming sector. When we left office, the average farm income was $29,000. It is now $4,600 in real terms. We provided the assistance to enable these people to survive. Statutory marketing delivered to us the same thing that the industrial award delivers to the workers of Australia. Statutory marketing has been smashed to pieces by the ALP government. Interest rates have been allowed to soar to 25 per cent, and I think that was probably an average figure in the state of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a high debt structured industry it was utterly impossible, even at the best of times, to carry those sorts of interest rates. When Mr Farley, who is condemning us, took over, farm incomes were $29,000, there were 179,000 farms in Australia, and the farm debt was $4,700 million. In the 10 years that the NFF has been in existence, the number of farmers has dropped by one-third&mdash;which is in keeping with Mr Farley's statement that one in three farmers had to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Julian McGauran from the National Party said to Mr Farley, `Who the hell are you&mdash;spokesman for the banks?' Senator McGauran was dead right in saying that; that is exactly correct. One in three farmers have gone. We now have only 122,000 farmers left in Australia. As I said before, farm incomes have dropped from $29,000 down to $4,600. Farm debt has risen from $4,700 million to nearly $17,500 million. This is the worst period in farm history in Australia. The figures in Queensland clearly indicate that one in two farms in inland Queensland now have a debt in excess of $500,000. Projected incomes for this year are minus $20,000-odd, albeit that that projection was made before the rise in wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that the drought is doing is delivering a coup de grace to an industry that was dying already. Looking for the contingent causes for that death, I refer to remarks made by Senator Boswell in the Senate chamber. He said that the causes of the wool crisis can be sheeted home to Mr Kerin who, acting upon the wishes of the then federal Treasurer, the current Prime Minister, decided to, firstly, undermine and break the confidence of the marketplace in the minimum price scheme for wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week before Mr Kerin's infamous press conference, the wool price was 890c a kilo and we were selling 80 per cent of the clip; two weeks after that infamous press conference of Mr Kerin, we were selling at the minimum price of 870c a kilo and we were only selling 20 per cent of the clip. Anyone who knows anything about buying and selling or the real world knows that, if you say and clearly indicate that you are going to put the price of your product down and not stand behind it, people who buy after that period of time would have to be fools. The buyers left in droves. But, of course, with criminal stupidity, the Wool Corporation of Australia continued selling. The market and auction system continued. We had massive sellers out there, but no buyers&mdash;and the price went straight through the floor. The blame for that can be sheeted to no-one other than those people sitting on the front bench on the other side of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second factor was interest rates. State banks in the main&mdash;this is from Trevor Sykes in his book and a series of articles&mdash;provided finance for their friends, cronies and party supporters. This was all fully documented in WA Inc., the Victorian royal commission and the South Australian royal commission. Their friends and supporters had $22,000 million parcelled out to them&mdash;and Trevor Sykes names the names, so you can check it all up&mdash;and the whole $22,000 million vanished off the face of the planet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian banks lost $22,000 million. No-one needs to be told where they went to get that $22,000 million back. The federal government allowed them to borrow money at interest rates of seven, eight and nine per cent, and it enabled them to parcel it out at interest rates in excess of 20 per cent&mdash;the highest margin in the entire world. Is it any wonder that, after losing $22,000 million, within two or three years they were back making record profits again? They made those record profits over the broken backs of the Australian farmers, many of whose families have lived out in the country for four and five generations and worked hard but who now have virtually nothing to show for that work. </PARA>

All of those tax arrangements&mdash;our ability to carry out water development projects on our station properties and to give us some real answer to drought&mdash;were removed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the Prime Minister's remarks about Australia no longer being dependent upon some sort of extended sheep run and a quarry, I went through the figures. It is funny how the government has compiled the figures. When you go through the itemised figures, there are only eight figures you can extract from the export items of this country that are non-mining or non-rural items. In fact, only four per cent of our total exports do not come from mining or from rural pastoral and agricultural pursuits. So, whether or not you argue about what point of downstream processing we are talking about, when you look at those figures you realise that he was deadly wrong in his comments. Only seven per cent of Australia's real export earnings come from any sector other than mining and agriculture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Drought Relief Payment Bill which we are debating is the government's reaction to a devastating situation now covering an increasing area of Australia. The government's response is disgraceful. I cannot welcome it; I can only acknowledge it, because it is four years too late and it is too restrictive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two types of drought in Australia. The first happens every three to four years, and it is acknowledged that farmers should be able to cope with that situation. The second happens every 10 to 15 years when there is a severe or exceptional drought. That type of drought is very well documented throughout the history of Australia. Farmers and, for that matter, town business people in rural communities cannot be expected to cope with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, look at the situation in Australia in 1793. The early settlers of Sydney would have starved because of a drought had it not been for wheat from Chile. Skipping quite a few droughts which occurred after that, in the 1890s about 40 million sheep were lost in a very severe drought. Once again skipping some of the droughts which occurred, there was a severe drought in the 1940s, in 1967, in 1982, and now, once again, we have a drought that started four years ago in the Darling Downs and other areas of southern Queensland, central Queensland and northern New South Wales. We are into the fourth year of a drought, not the first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well before the last election the coalition was aware that there was a severe drought. We worked with state farm organisations, rural counsellors and the NFF, particularly Michael Tooth: he was aware of the problem, although some other members of the NFF did not rate it very highly. There was recognition then that we were facing not an ordinary but a severe or an exceptional situation. Since that time, the drought has been moving south. In my electorate in northern Victoria, sheep kills are under way at the present time. Because of irrigation, the impact that drought is having at this stage would be far less than the impact it is having in most areas to the north. The impact on those rural communities and on Australia is increasing and it will continue for many years. One of the ironies of the wool stockpile is that the impact of the drought on wool exports on our balance of payments will not be felt for some time. The stockpile is now a great positive. The release of wool from the stockpile at that higher price will keep up the export prices for wool even though it will not help wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The devastation of this drought has had a very significant impact on other industries, on this country's balance of payments and on the standard of living of all Australians. For example, look at grain. We will not be able to maintain our grain export markets. The figure for wheat exports keeps dropping all the time; it is already less than half of what it was last year. As the standard of living increases in those countries around the Pacific rim there is an increasing demand for barley for beer production. That will not be able to be provided. Legumes, whether for protein for humans or for animals, will not be able to be provided by Australia to countries around the Pacific rim, particularly South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A massive kill of our beef herd and our lambs is occurring at the present time. That is probably bringing the consumers of Australia the cheapest meat, in real terms, that they have had for years&mdash;probably the cheapest meat, in real terms, of any country in the world. But that will change because of the dramatic shortage that will occur. As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) pointed out, it is so sad that the GATT Uruguay Round has provided the beef industry with an opportunity to increase its markets but that we will not be able to provide those markets. Hard won export markets in grain fed cattle, which is highly value added, will not be able to be sustained in Japan, Korea and a number of other countries because of the price of grain, whether imported or local. There is an ironic twist in the case of pig meat, a domestic industry. That industry will suffer because of the high price of grain and the increase in the importation of pig meat from Canada, which has some subsidised arrangements for grain, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of payments calculation so far is about $2 billion. I believe that is a very much understated figure. It does not take into account a whole range of other industries which will lose export markets and it does not take into account the importation of grain, which will become a significant factor; it is just starting now. I think we are talking about many more billion dollars of income lost, not just for farmers but for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why, when we talk about maintaining the herd and the flock, fodder is critical. Those who criticise the fodder assistance proposal of the coalition are either very naive or they just want to genuflect to this government. No fodder scheme can increase the price of fodder&mdash;grain more than anything&mdash;in this country because the price of fodder is already above import parity. That is the ultimate levelling effect of price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wheat Board received some criticism in relation to its stocks of grain. This government's legislation changed the Wheat Board's role from one of having a responsibility to provide a drought reserve to one of having just a responsibility for commercial pricing and commercial marketing. I acknowledge that the grain producers would say that fodder schemes and that sort of thing does not help them. That is why any assistance program has to be flexible&mdash;to pick up all the different categories that are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drought is also potentially devastating to the environment. The Darling River will be the first evidence of that. It will have blue-green algae before very long. With several years of drought, the Darling has basically stopped flowing. As the Deputy Speaker would know, getting enough water to South Australia is a problem, with no flow in the Darling because of the restrictions in the Barmah choke and the physical ability of getting water through. It does remind us&mdash;and the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) has just indicated this&mdash;that we should be thankful for those water storages that have been built in southern Australia which mean that the Murray River and the Murrumbidgee River are flowing at this time. Before these water storages, when we had severe drought, those rivers also stopped flowing. Adelaide would really be in trouble if that were the situation now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the problem of ground cover. So many acres of our land are fragile because of the drought. I want to be optimistic. When I look at, say, the Mallee country of Australia and see its productivity, its fertility, its stability and its sustainable agriculture and compare it with what it was like in the 1940s, when it was blowing everywhere, it shows what has been achieved and what can be achieved after a drought, given a fair chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought is also devastating for families and rural communities. As the member for Kennedy said, rural debt is already $17 billion, and it will leap. We have had the disgraceful situation where many farm families have not had food on their tables. Their children have had to be removed from school. Town business has dramatically suffered and employment of people in country towns has suffered. This situation is disgraceful because it is not new. Historically, it is obvious that it will occur every so often, and we need to be ready for it. It is disgraceful because the present round of the drought is already four years old. It is disgraceful because, had it not been for Ray Martin and what he did to publicise the drought in the media and the well-meaning generosity of thousands of Australians in country towns and cities who provided food parcels for these people, I do not believe the government would have acted even now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Country people have been treated as though they do not have the same rights as other Australians. There is no longer a welfare safety net for them as there is for all other Australians. They are being provided with food parcels as though they do not belong to Australia but to a Third World country. This legislation is limited because the only ones who will achieve any assistance at all are those who can show they have been in drought for two out of the last three years. Why has this happened when historically it is quite clear that severe or exceptional droughts will occur every 10 to 15 years? It has happened because of this government's ideology against country people and the self-employed and its ignorance of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government removed or changed much of coalition legislation that was automatically in place to pick up this situation. First of all, in 1984 it removed or changed income equalisation deposits&mdash;this meant that the very important self-insurance mechanism was no longer there&mdash;less than two years after the last severe drought. It should have been obvious to everybody that that was the best way to help people put some cash aside in good years, which would have been tremendously important for wheat growers, for graziers in low rainfall areas where fodder is not an alternative, and for wool growers while the prices were high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen this government do some very cynical things. In a belated attempt to make income equalisation deposits, or self-insurance, more acceptable, it announced the proposal in one budget and delayed its introduction for 12 months. Because wool prices were high at that time, wool growers were not able to take advantage of the proposal. There have been other tax incentives for on-farm assistance measures, or sustainable agricultural development measures, which others have referred to, which farmers lost faith in because the government kept changing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government brought in the assets test for Austudy, for aged pensions and for jobstart allowances in a way that did not recognise one of the great reasons why Australian agriculture is a world beater: it is an intensive user of capital. The average farm capital is $750,000, well above the cut-off for the assets test&mdash;and I include the non-incorporated town businesses in the same category in this regard. The government forgot the fundamental point: even if you do have an asset, you cannot sell it in a drought anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people have not been able to get into the welfare net available to all other Australians. The government changed the farm household support to put more pressure on adjustment out of agriculture by basically turning it into a loan scheme. The last thing a farmer wants is another loan when he is in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England, who did so much to put these processes in place when he was the minister, brought in farm household support in 1977, even when we had no assets test on unemployment benefits. He recognised the need to have a welfare net for farm householders for 12 months while they sorted themselves out. That is a right given to all other Australians, but this government changed that again. The irony is that the main element of this Drought Relief Payment Bill is basically, in a very restrictive way, a return to the original farm household support concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government also removed drought from the natural disaster scheme. Some would argue that it was because of Queensland's use; I would argue that it was because of the South Australian Labor government not being prepared to do anything to help its drought affected farmers at that time. Some would say that the criteria were not right. If the criteria are not right, you change them; you do not drop the scheme. We in our policy recognise that and changed the criteria for drought for inclusion in the natural disaster scheme to `severe' drought to pick up the devastating situation we are suffering now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to drop drought was made by a `loaded' committee, which was instructed to remove drought from the natural disaster arrangements which are still there for fire, flood, et cetera. I give credit to Michael Tooth, who was the NFF representative, for the way he fought for this. That is why we decided that severe drought should still be a natural disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the right honourable member for New England and others have pointed out, it is important to work with the states in this regard. Once the natural disaster scheme comes in it not only picks up the state measures that are working there but also picks up, for example, grain growers and town business people through the special loan arrangements. That is the point of the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) on behalf of the coalition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like all members who have spoken before me, I support the Drought Relief Payment Bill, which implements a much needed and long overdue drought package, as limited as it is. It is always a pleasure to speak after the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) because there would be few people in Australia who would know as much about the rural sector as he does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we in the Riverina are not suffering our fourth year of drought, as they are in parts of Queensland, nevertheless in most of the region outside the irrigation areas stock has been put on to many crops where they were planted and where they were able to break the parched surface. Members who have spoken before me have put the case of those people sadly affected by long periods of drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales. The member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who travels extensively throughout north-western New South Wales and who represents over a third of the state, has pointed out some of the problems with the new drought package, as has the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), whose electorate would be one of the worst affected in Australia. Both would agree that the package in many cases has come at least two years too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farmers reeling from the Hawke-Keating government's high interest rates and taxes, along with ever increasing farm input costs, as well as low commodity prices, have been facing a mainly government induced economic drought and have now hit the high sandhill with the long dry period of serious drought. The whole fabric of the bush, already wearing thin under the Keating strain, is now being torn asunder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have previously said, the conditions in the dry farming areas of the Riverina, whilst not the worst in Australia, have many people saying that they are facing the worst drought in living memory. Many are already moving to rid themselves of stock, much of it their breeding herds and flocks. As has been said by speakers before me, it is not only those on the land who are directly affected but also business houses in the small and not so small rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has already been intimated that large animal food producers such as piggeries, poultry farms and feed lots are now being severely affected by a shortage of grain and fodder. People who process grain are also being affected because there are limited supplies. Many of these producers are the major employers in rural Australia, particularly in the Riverina. Apart from the lost production, the effect of this unemployment on top of the Keating recession will be horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us who live in rural Australia know how difficult it is to maintain population levels in country towns and how melancholy empty towns can be. I am fortunate that I live in the oasis of the MIA. I am sure many like me are becoming aware, if they were not before, of the importance of conserving the nation's water supplies. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, knowing where you live, I know that you are aware of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to read in the Prime Minister's drought statement of 21 September that the government would provide a generous tax incentive for the building of farm storage and water facilities to encourage farmers to better prepare for drought. Whilst nothing much has happened yet, it is indeed good news. However, whilst the conservation of water is the cheapest way to go, we must now get away from the fear that politicians seem to have today of building new, large storage dams, not only for irrigation purposes but also for ecological reasons. We are all aware of the blue-green algae problem, which the member for Murray mentioned; in the past few years it has been re-recognised. But it seems to be a scientific fact that if we can keep a reasonable flow through the systems then the problem of the algae is greatly diminished, even allowing for other causes for algal blooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Darling River had stopped running when Captain Sturt crossed it in 1828 and in 1845. Since the 1870s, when rainfall records were first kept, there have been many drought periods in parts of the catchment. The Darling was affected by severe drought for eight years between 1895 and 1902. It was also affected from 1911 to 1916, from 1918 to 1920, in 1940, 1943, 1946, from 1964 to 1966, from 1982 to 1984, and during the current drought. Between Bourke and Menindee the river stopped flowing for 363 days from January 1902. That magnifies the point that the member for Murray was making that, if it were not for the dams on the Murray system, there would probably be no water flowing through those systems at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although many people blame irrigators for taking too much water, the fact is that if we wish the river to have an assured environmental flow we have to have more upstream storage. Now may be the time to examine the feasibility of diverting the north-eastern rivers for that purpose. The feasibility study will never be cheaper to conduct than at present. Of course, we all remember the promise Malcolm Fraser made that he would conduct an investigation into that project if he were elected in the 1983 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who oppose irrigation or are less than enthusiastic about its implementation, I can only say that the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation, FAO, believes that irrigation is essential and that, over the next 30 years, an estimated 80 per cent of the additional food supplies required to feed the world will depend on irrigation. Having said that we need more dams, I agree that the cheapest option for Australia in the short term is to educate people in the conservation of water. But water scarcity is a worldwide problem. Although water is a renewable resource, it is also a finite one. World water supplies are one-third lower now than in 1970 due to a population increase of 1.8 billion since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a nation's water availability drops below one megalitre per annum per person, nations are considered water scarce&mdash;that is, lack of water becomes a severe constraint on food production, economic development and the protection of natural systems and human health. We live on one of the driest continents on earth. Part of our educational process should be to inform everyone, particularly school children, that fresh, potable water is a valuable and finite resource, and its availability will eventually determine the extent of this nation's growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many of us waste water or see water wasted every day. I must say that I am a keen gardener, but when I consider that each Australian on average uses 300 litres of water per day in their homes and in many parts of Australia half of the daily consumption is used on gardens I am warned that this cannot continue indefinitely. Another way water use could be contained would be for governments to provide capital for those irrigation schemes that urgently need refurbishment, such as the MIA. Many parts of the MIA are now 80 years old. Wherever possible, the concrete channels should be made watertight and earthen channels concreted or sealed to prevent leakage, which itself poses a problem. More has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope to be able to say more on water preservation quality and management on another occasion, but I will now look at the plight of small businesses in areas that are being drought affected at this time. We are all aware that small business throughout Australia is becoming demoralised by the actions of the federal government, particularly as they become more aware of how the recently announced industrial relations policy affects them. There were a number of items on television this morning about that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than two-thirds of Australian small business employers do not want the industry awards in their workplaces that are being thrust upon them by the government. Add to this the effect that drought is having on sales, which have been down for some time because of the recession and low commodity prices, and members can understand why the coalition is moving an amendment which recognises the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia who are affected by drought conditions and calls on the government to act urgently to develop a strategy to assist these people. If the government had moved sooner on this drought relief package, then small business would not have the problem it has today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two weeks ago the owner of what I considered to be a very viable rural hardware shop in my electorate told me that it was the quietest day he could remember in 20 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's policy on drought aid is based on relief, retention and recovery. Firstly, we believe that seriously drought affected farmers must be given immediate relief. Hopefully, this bill will do that, although some confusion does reign.

<PARA>But, as has been said before by many members, the last thing that producers want today is another debt on top of the debt they already have. For too long now this government has taken farmers for granted. If it were not for the pressure put on the government from the media, farm organisations and the coalition, there would still be little done for farmers, despite the fact that they directly provide 26 per cent of our overseas earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, all types of taxes and interest rates on top of low commodity prices made these people almost peasant farmers even before the advent of the drought. The drought has now highlighted the problem and governments have to decide whether they want our agricultural sector or not. They have to get away from the old socialist class structure idea that if you own a block of land you are wealthy and of a different class. While many on the government side of the House would deny this charge, it becomes evident when you hear many of the interjections that fly from the government side. They just cannot help themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the parliament ever appears to be doing for the farming sector is trying to fix a problem long after the crisis has developed and casualties are numerous.

If we can carry out this planning, then at least some good may come out of the drought, given that its detrimental effects will last for many years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speakers on this side of the House have already highlighted the many ironies surrounding the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994. I, like my colleagues and rural Australia in general, am breathing a collective sigh of relief as, after many attempts to convince the government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about the extent of the drought tragedy, they have finally responded. To their credit, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, and the government have responded positively, if not somewhat belatedly, introducing many of the in-principle measures that were part of the coalition package; namely, the family income support payment&mdash;the drought relief payment, the waiving of the assets test for Austudy and other payments, and a more flexible and expanded rural adjustment scheme. These are all welcome measures and should alleviate some of the burden of drought which, as we have heard today, has plagued many Queensland farmers, including farmers in my own electorate of Hinkler, for up to four years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent discussions I have had with the cattle industry, I was horrified at the continuing very high female kill, in particular the high rate of breeders in calf being sold at Queensland meatworks. Normally about one-third of the Queensland kill is made up of females, yet in recent months it has peaked at around 45 per cent, with reports of 60 per cent of those females being in calf. For the unenlightened, such statistics indicate a very serious erosion of our cattle herd and put in question our ability to service some key markets in the years to come, even if the drought breaks tomorrow. For instance, the American market could well muscle in on Australia's markets. Hence, I cannot understand why there is such resistance to the coalition's fodder subsidy proposal that was put up by the shadow minister, especially in light of the government's decision now to import $20 million worth of grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turning to a few measures contained in the bill. The exclusion of bona fide retirement assets in particular should enable more farmers to access interest subsidies under RAS. Currently, about 2,800 Queensland farmers receive RAS under the exceptional circumstances provision. My advice from Queensland's new Rural Adjustment Authority is that the new guidelines should benefit a further 10 per cent of farmers. The definition of `long-term viability' still remains a bone of contention for many struggling farmers trying to access the scheme, as borne out in submissions to the Senate's rural debt inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of preparing for future droughts still remains unanswered. The government has said that it will look at revamping the income equalisation deposits scheme and providing greater tax relief for fodder and water conservation. Let us hope that this amounts to more than just lip service. The return to the former Sinclair regime of IEDs would be most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the coalition's amendment to this bill calling for the recognition of the plight of small business operators in rural and regional Australia. Small business operators are, as has already been said in the debate, often forgotten victims of the drought. If it is not bad enough that country towns have been denuded of government services and facilities, the retailers and small business operators are now being choked by the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate of Hinkler, the drought has hit hard in the small business sector in a number of rural towns, in particular the likes of Monto, Eidsvold and Biloela in the north and west of my electorate. Monto is an important rural service centre containing 80 small businesses&mdash;from the taxi driver to the grocery store to the steelworks. The president of the Monto Chamber of Commerce, Ian Brighouse, says that businesses are feeling the effects of the drought, with business incomes estimated to be down 10 to 15 per cent. Mr Brighouse says that business is the backbone of towns like Monto and that the government needs to look at measures like tax breaks to help them survive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story is the same in Eidsvold and Biloela. Biloela, at the crossroads of the Dawson and Callide valleys, has in the order of 100 small businesses. While principally a rural service centre, Biloela has the advantage of a couple of coalmines and a power station to keep its economy moving. However, my advice is that the business operators of the town are experiencing revenues down 15 per cent because of the drought, with incomes from non-essential small businesses like coffee shops, hairdressers, dress shops, et cetera, down as much as 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government has recently moved to assist this important sector with the introduction of a 50 per cent interest subsidy on new and existing commercial loans for eligible businesses. The affected small businesses can obtain a maximum of $5,000 per annum, that is, $10,000 over two years. Larger businesses may be eligible for $10,000 per annum, or $20,000 over two years. The package is worth a total of $5 million. While I welcome the initiative, I agree with the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association's assessment that `it will not go far enough'. With outstanding farmer debts of $150,000 and interest rates on small business currently around 12 per cent, many businesses are carrying interest bills of $20,000 per year or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recognising the plight of small businesses in rural and regional areas, I call on the federal government to take the lead from the Queensland government and provide matching funding, topping up not only the actual amount of assistance but also the level of interest subsidies to, say, 100 per cent in line with on farm assistance measures. It would be a relatively easy thing to include in the drought package. Such a measure would be a welcome addition to the federal government's own drought package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the molasses situation, which I believe has reached a crisis point in Australia. I wish to use this opportunity to highlight another cruel twist to the drought&mdash;that is, the growing crisis in stockfeed and related drought supplements in both Queensland and areas of New South Wales. In recent days it has been heartening to hear the announcement by the federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, of a national audit of fodder and grain supplies, especially in light of this year's poor wheat harvest and industry speculation about grain imports. However, it does disappoint me that his Queensland colleague the Hon. Ed Casey MLA does not appear to share the same level of concern about stockfeed supplies, particularly when it comes to molasses supplies in that state and in northern New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is molasses? It is an important supplementary drought feed. As a by-product of the sugar industry, in good times it is available from northern New South Wales right through to North Queensland. Molasses is a critical source of liquid energy. It also supplies an important means of protein supplementation through the addition of urea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, following representations from many graziers and transporters in my electorate, I called on the Queensland Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, and his state government to address the problem of dwindling molasses supplies in southern Queensland. I urged the minister to consider redirecting export bound molasses supplies from North Queensland to drought affected producers in the south. I also urged the state minister to convene a round table conference with representatives of the sugar millers, the Australian Molasses Trading&mdash;that is the conduit for export&mdash;the cane growers and the peak bodies of the grazing industry to map out a contingency plan to ensure that molasses supplies continue through the rest of the year and on to the start of the 1995 crushing season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His simple response was that there was no crisis and that I was a panic merchant&mdash;despite the fact that I made my appeal in a non-confrontationist manner and certainly in a bipartisan manner. A recent survey of southern Queensland mills south of Bundaberg in my electorate showed that nearly all stocks of molasses were either committed or contracted. Stocks at Fairymead mill in Bundaberg, the only mill with some spare capacity, were effectively being rationed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One local contractor who carries up to 27 tanker loads per week told me that he had been limited to five loads. That effectively means that 22 farmers, or groups of farmers, do not get any molasses. They have no quality fodder. Without the molasses, there is very little chance of their cattle surviving. He had already exhausted the 3,500 tonnes available to him under contract, but expected to carry 7,000 tonnes if stocks were made available. He had to travel up to 600 kilometres to Mackay to offset shortages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, advice from senior management at the Mackay sugar company, as recently as a few days ago, was that they now have no spare capacity and are only servicing their immediate hinterland customers. Despite the fact that New South Wales producers were sourcing supplies out of southern Queensland, the state Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Casey, refused to acknowledge that there was a problem with molasses supplies. That was last Friday morning. By lunchtime Mr Casey had changed his tune. In an interview with the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS>, he finally admitted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we've got to the stage where there will have to be molasses brought down from north Queensland into the system in southern Queensland because that's the area of demand.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the point that I had been making to him during the week. It took him until midday on Friday to acknowledge it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, Mr Casey has seemed reluctant to sit down with representatives of Queensland's cattle industry to do some forward planning on molasses supplies. Meanwhile, the Cattlemen's Union&mdash;led by its state chairperson, Mrs Hazle Marland&mdash;went ahead and arranged for 6,000 tonnes to be sourced from the South Johnston mill near Innisfail in North Queensland, with a possibility of a further 20,000 tonnes being made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government, in its generosity&mdash;and I use the term `generosity' advisedly&mdash;has offered to provide six 45-tonne rail tankers to help cart the molasses to a depot in Gympie in southern Queensland, meaning that the flow of important supplies southwards will be under extreme demand pressure all the time. It is hoped that the state will have a change of heart in the next couple of days and will provide additional rail wagon tankers. But if the cattle industry in Queensland cannot convince the state government of the imminent crisis in the molasses supplies, maybe the federal minister can. An ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> interview revealed the minister as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `We're certainly well aware of the problem I can assure you . . . the fact that we are exporting molasses and that it may be required domestically . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins is expected to announce the findings of a national audit of fodder and feedstocks during the current sitting of parliament. I look forward, in that report, to his assessment of molasses supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem of molasses supplies raises, dare I say it, the `sticky' question of export contracts. In this season alone, Queensland will export some 430,000 tonnes of molasses overseas, principally to the United States market. Despite a record crushing season, domestic demand for drought feeding is on the rise. We are, I believe, rapidly approaching the situation wherein we may have to consider redirecting some export contracts in order to save breeding stock at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate that this may put our export credibility at some risk. Yet we are now importing grain from overseas for the first time in many decades, and that alone should be indicative of the drought crisis besetting our producers. I realise that there are financial and other costs associated with breaking export contracts, but I have written to the federal minister, Senator Collins, calling for special funding assistance to cover such a situation. A guarantee or subsidy may be required to allow either North Queensland tankers to be diverted or, alternatively, for molasses to be imported from overseas. This happened in 1992. The state government was forced to divert from export 60,000 tonnes of molasses to southern Queensland, with a further 24,000 tonnes being imported by the Bundaberg Sugar Co. Surely it would be an appropriate and logical extension of the federal government's drought assistance package for it to find room to assist New South Wales and Queensland producers in funding such a redirection of supplies, if required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not trying to panic producers over molasses supplies or trying to politicise the drought. Rather, I am simply responding to a genuine call for help from battling producers. In particular, I am calling on the Queensland government to sit down with the industry and to do some forward planning of molasses supplies before it is too late. Surely the lesson of 1992 cannot go unheeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I welcome overall the federal government's belated drought assistance package. But we can still go further, as the Prime Minister said, `to not leave behind the farmers'. The government could look at some special assistance to small business in rural and regional areas along the lines of the dollar-for-dollar subsidy of the Queensland scheme or the likes of an interest subsidy scheme such as that previously mentioned for molasses supplies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the parliamentary secretary says, it is woefully inadequate. I want to take the time that I have to make a special plea for consideration of the situation of the north coast of New South Wales. I will come to the point shortly about what used to be the Pastures Protection Board for the district of Grafton, which was in and then out. That caused a great deal of consternation. The rainfall on the north coast of New South Wales in many areas is quite high. Coffs Harbour, for instance, has a rainfall of 77 per cent. Out west, where they might have a rainfall of 19 or, say, 28 inches, if they lose two-thirds of that, they are in great trouble. If Coffs Harbour and other coastal centres which have a high rainfall lose two-thirds of their rainfall, people say, `You still have 25 inches; you have tonnes.' But it is not true; it is not realistic. The reality is that the coastal areas with the high rainfall are in a green drought, but still a drought, even when they are getting more rain than the inland. It is a totally different set of circumstances and it needs special consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the government and to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) to take on board this aspect because it is vitally important to the people I represent. The member for Richmond (Mr Newell), the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and I are all in the same boat&mdash;Labor and National Party members trying to look after the people on the north coast of New South Wales. It is a special case. It will be to the eternal shame of the present federal minister if he does not accept that, look at the situation and see what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I have welcomed the drought relief scheme, there is nothing for small business in it. Numbers of small businesses have been suffering desperately through the recession. Now they cannot get paid and are going to go out of business and go broke. It is disastrous. The government is providing $164 million over two years in drought assistance. I join with those who applaud the government, but it is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put that $164 million over two years into some perspective, when the government was reorganising the waterfront it provided $430 million in golden handshakes to the wharfies&mdash;$100,000 each&mdash;to try to get greater productivity on the wharves. There has been some improvement. But how would it be if we could give $100,000 each&mdash;I use this purely as an example&mdash;to those farmers who are in such dire straits? To put it in perspective, $430 million in golden handshakes to the wharfies and $164 million over two years for the farm industries, the primary producers, the backbone of this country. A one per cent interest rise will cost the farm sector $120 million and the Reserve Bank is telling us that there will be more interest rises down the track, perhaps two by Christmas. A one per cent interest rise on the farm debt will take away $120 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are really only dancing around the edges. We are not getting stuck into it. Another example is the gift to ANL, the Australian National Line. In one breath the responsible minister said we could not give it away and the next minute we are giving $20 million a year in income tax subsidies to the company. It does not sit sensibly. There is no comparison between the ANL or the waterfront situation and what is happening in primary production areas right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening in these areas is total social disruption. We are getting family breakup.

What the government is doing so far is good, but it has to do more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute to so many individuals, organisations and corporations who have responded in true Australian spirit to the drought. The one great heartening thing that has come out of this drought is that so many people right across Australia are caring and concerned and are exercising their compassion. I will give the House a few examples because I think that tribute should be paid. Some people in Coffs Harbour, where I live, Laurie Wynen and Di Strachan, operate Seafood Mama's, a very good restaurant. They put on four breakfasts and one lunch. They provided all the food, and the staff worked for nothing. That raised $6,119.25. They did so out of the goodness of their hearts. Coffs City rotary club then sent the money on to Narrabri rotary, who distributed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee was set up by Robin Gourlay and, through the Salvation Army, distributed food and other things from the town to needy people in the country. They are able to maintain the privacy of people who need it. The rotary club in Coffs Harbour is sponsoring a food appeal. It takes us back to World War II, with food parcels for Britain. Right around this country, just as is happening in Coffs Harbour with Coffs Harbour rotary, people are being asked to donate food. This is for Australian farmers. I find it absolutely unbelievable. Thank God there are good, caring, compassionate people out there who are doing this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier I mentioned small business. Out in these areas shopkeepers are suffering. They are not being paid. They need help, too. The government has to address that. I have been told that in many places people are selling off their valuable family heritage items just to stay afloat, just to pay the bills. It is not just the stock who are suffering; the Australian people are suffering as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned corporations which have been involved in very generous incidents. Caltex provided $8,000 to fund a convoy of hay to Walcha. We all know about the Angry Anderson convoy, which Shell paid the fuel bill for, from Victoria to Texas in Queensland. Ampol provided $2,000 for 12 tankers from Lake Macquarie council, Newcastle council and a couple of private people to go to Glen Innes and distribute water. They have delivered water to 100 farms, each of them getting at least a tanker full, because they had no water. One of the most heartbreaking things was the comment one of those tanker drivers heard when he delivered the water. A little boy said, `Mum, does this mean I can have a bath tonight?' We have Australian kids who cannot even have a bath. While that may be dramatic, it is part of what is happening in this drought. We have to realise that. </PARA>

If the drought continues for another three months, 80 per cent of farms will have inadequate stock water, an almost complete lack of stock feed and a total ban on irrigation. As well, 20 per cent of dairy farms will cease production and 80 per cent will have reduced production.

It is time to get up and do something. At the very least, all drought restricted farmers in Australia should send in a letter to their federal member and make an application to the rural assistance scheme. Do not wait; do it now.

I would like to highlight to the parliament today that not just those parts of New South Wales and Queensland that have been declared as having severe drought and exceptional circumstances are drought stricken. The areas that the former speaker, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), and I represent&mdash;the mid-north coast of New South Wales&mdash;are experiencing extreme circumstances and severe drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some statistics. The rainfall this year has been the lowest on record since 1905. In fact, the situation for water is absolutely desperate, not just domestically but for stock water as well. It is something that the government must keep in mind, yet the people in my electorate are not covered by the Drought Relief Payment Bill and they are not capable of applying for assistance from the government because of the declarations in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will read the amendment moved by the shadow minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), late yesterday afternoon with regard to small business operators. These people are really suffering. I think we have failed to recognise the extent to which they are suffering as a result of this drought, bearing in mind that people in rural towns rely on the rural community very heavily for their custom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this drought has been biting over the last 12 or 18 months in some areas and over the last four years in other areas, the people in the rural small business community have been very accommodating in extending credit. They have been carrying not only their own debts, the debt of maintaining their stock in trade, but also a lot of the debt of the rural community. The people in the rural community are in such a devastated situation that they have no hope of servicing a debt with small business. It is very important that the government recognise that. The amendment that I urge the government to support, moved by the shadow minister yesterday, reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>

<PARA>What will happen if the government does not accept this amendment? Is the government saying that it will not recognise the plight of small business in rural areas? If it does not accept the amendment that is exactly what it is saying. It should be made abundantly clear to all small business operators in rural Australia that the government, by not accepting this amendment, does not care and will not recognise the situation that those small businesses are in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. We will not go down the path that many previous speakers have gone down by putting on the public record all the other areas in which the government this year has recognised the special interests and special needs of different community groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today is a piece of enabling legislation which gives effect to the package that the government announced recently. We support that and acknowledge that the package will go a long way. It does not go all the way&mdash;not as far as the coalition policy did when it was released. The government should have followed that. The government's response to the severe drought conditions in Australia today is partly because of the visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to two different sections of the rural community in Australia, but it is also in response to the policy that the coalition released a number of weeks ago. We will be pooh-poohed by the government members for saying that, but it is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, and particularly the Prime Minister, has had to be dragged kicking and screaming to address this very serious issue that is confronting Australia today. It has also just come to realise the devastating effect that the drought is going to have on not only the front line of rural producers but also the rural small business community. It will also affect the consumers across Australia and the people in rural Australia that rely on rainwater for domestic use. I will quote some statistics shortly to outline that fact in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a note here of the parallels between the policy the government has introduced and the coalition's drought package. In relation to the provision of immediate farm family income support, the coalition had a revamped household support scheme and a suspension of the assets test on welfare payments. The government has picked this up via the new drought relief payment. The government has paralleled the measure we announced in advance of its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also outlined improved access to Austudy for children from farm families in drought areas by exempting them from the on-farm assets test for this benefit, greater flexibility and increased funding under the rural adjustment scheme for farmers experiencing drought exceptional circumstances, and provision and assistance through RAS for up to 12 months after the drought breaks. These measures were announced well in advance of the government putting its policy together. That is why we have not criticised the government's package, apart from the fact that it was too late. The government should have been pro-active instead of reactive on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear every sitting day in this place from members on the government benches about how many rural and regional seats the government holds. Why were those people not taken note  of? Surely those people must have been talking about this drought in the caucus more than two months ago. Why has it taken the government so long to react? The government has been reactive on this issue rather than pro-active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) had meetings with the state ministers for agriculture with regard to getting a standard description of drought declared areas across Australia, but there seem to be&mdash;we hear examples every day&mdash;arbitrary lines drawn in the sand. People on one side of the line are going to be eligible under this package to claim relief from the Commonwealth government and people on the other side of the line certainly are not. The explanatory memorandum states that one item of the bill seeks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to provide that a person qualifies for drought relief payment if he or she is: a farmer; at least 18; an Australian resident; in Australia; and in possession of a drought exceptional circumstances certificate issued in respect of him or her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought exceptional circumstances certificate is issued to farmers by a RAS authority under a memorandum of understanding between the RAS authority and the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The certificate is evidence that a farmer's property is located in an area affected by extreme drought, consistent with guidelines issued by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in respect of the exceptional circumstances provisions of the Rural Adjustment Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>It is still too arbitrary. Rainfall does not observe a line in the sand. So the government, and the minister particularly, should be doing a little more work in that regard to try to make that a little more flexible. There are people who desperately need assistance and need it now, but because of the rule book and because of the arbitrary nature of those declarations cannot get it. So they are suffering while their neighbours 10 miles down the road might not be. It is a vexed question in a lot of areas of Australia as far as this support is concerned and I think the government desperately needs to recognise that in dealing with the measures we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing this debate has brought out is that the government, although it has been there for 10 years, has not had a specific strategy to deal with severe drought in advance. Drought we deal with. Drought is a natural event, as the Prime Minister said. Severe drought we have to be a little more humane and compassionate about. I think the government has a lot of work to do to put in place a proper strategy to deal with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last sitting week I spoke in the grievance debate about the relief&mdash;this was prior to the release of the government's package&mdash;that was available and the seriousness of the situation. I spoke about a fundraising exercise that was conducted in the town I live in, Wingham, on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. It is a small community which managed to raise $27,000 on one night at a charity auction. This was all for drought relief for western New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that money was provided in drought relief through the farm aid program that was developed by the Ray Martin program. In fact, auctioned on the night was one of Ray Martin's more colourful ties. He might be a relation of our current Speaker here, who has the same surname and also wears colourful ties. A lot of the money went through that Ray Martin program, ending up with what I think is called the Farmhand group, which, I am led to understand, is administered by the NFF&mdash;and that is fine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the money raised throughout the community for relief and that is being targeted to drought stricken areas goes through that particular program. One of the government members made me aware after that debate that that money attracts a dollar for dollar subsidy from the government. The government said, `We will provide the same amount of money as is raised through here.' It ended up with $3 million or $4 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that same night, I think $7,500 was given to the Smith Family for exactly the same purpose. In my area and throughout New South Wales, the Smith Family is providing direct household support. The Smith Family is a recognised charity in Australia. It does a fantastic job in these areas, yet to date I am not aware of the government matching dollar for dollar the money that the Smith Family has raised to be directed not at its other programs but for drought relief. I received a letter before I came down to Canberra for this week's sitting from Mrs Margaret Pollard, who is manager of the Smith Family office in Taree. The letter reads:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This charity is out there supporting hundreds of families with crisis cash and other assistance given IMMEDIATELY. These families can't wait for assessment or for this organisation to raise the necessary funding. Therefore it is very important to receive as much assistance as possible and we really do need this boost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Application has been made through our head office channels, but to date we have had no response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a personal approach by me, to see what you might be able to achieve for my branch and the organisation for which I work.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an organisation that is providing immediate cash  relief for families in crisis. There are lots of families in crisis that do not fall within the criteria for drought relief set out in the bill. I will write to the minister and include a copy of that letter. I urge the government to seriously consider that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to a letter that I received from the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association, which asks for support for rural small businesses. That organisation highlights a few points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one else was prepared to help the farming community, certainly not many of the banks, but small business did.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, because the drought has lasted longer than anyone anticipated, many of these small businesses are in danger of total collapse themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent initiative by the Federal Government to assist farmers is certainly very welcome but there is nothing of significance that will allow farmers to pay off much of this debt.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the debt that they have to small businesses in those rural communities. The association raises one very salient point about government assistance&mdash;it relates also to the letter from the Smith Family&mdash;and that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we as a nation can provide (and we should) assistance by way of finance to South Africa, Ireland and aid to Papua New Guinea and Rwanda etc, then surely we have a moral obligation to also do something constructive for our own rural business.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important point, a salient point, for this government to consider in future deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the attention of the parliament and the minister some of the severe circumstances that exist on the coast of New South Wales as a result of this drought. I will read some statistics from the Gloucester Rural Lands Protection Board, which covers part of my electorate. As of today&mdash;I received these statistics today&mdash;the percentage of farms where on-farm slaughter may be needed is five per cent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 3 months, `crunch' time for major management decisions. 70% of district will be out of stock water and probably one-third of stock will have to be put down (too weak to transport for sale). Grain will be unaffordable and hay supply almost non-existent.</PARA>

<PARA>From the Kempsey Rural Lands Protection Board, the percentage of farms where on-farm slaughter may be needed is presently two per cent. In three months time, it will be 25 per cent, and in six months time it will be 80 per cent. In relation to the major district drought related problems, the board states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Lack of water on farm. 2. Lack of nutritious fodder. 3. Decreased availability and cost of purchased fodder. 4. Low saleyard process even for fat or feedlot cattle. 5.

<PARA>Those pointers will have a devastating impact. Honourable members have heard what will happen in three months time. In relation to the weather outlook, the National Farmers Federation states:</PARA>

<PARA>At the beginning of the new year, a lot of my electorate on the mid-north coast of New South Wales will be absolutely devastated because of the lack of water. I return to the point that started my contribution to the debate: to date, with the drought relief policy that the government will implement with this legislation, it will not at this stage assist any of the people in crisis in my electorate. The people that are in stressful situations now are being helped by organisations like the Smith Family. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's drought package is a good one by any measure, and has been acknowledged as such by the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia and the wider Australian community. The package provides for a systematic and comprehensive approach covering farm welfare, assistance for farm businesses and protection of the land resource base. The government has indicated that it will be considering further action to assist in easing the burden of the current drought and in preparing for future droughts. Initiatives are being considered in the areas of taxation, income equalisation deposits, structural adjustment, land care and climate research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought relief payment before the House represents only one aspect of the wider package. The package deals effectively with the three Rs mentioned by the opposition&mdash;relief, retention and recovery. Importantly, the package provides for well-targeted assistance, not the sort of untargeted scheme mentioned by some members of the opposition which is open to abuse. Fodder subsidies have already been proven to be ineffective and do not have the support of many farm organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the eligibility criteria for the drought relief payment will mean that some farmers will not qualify. The package targets assistance to worst affected farm families in exceptional circumstance areas.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government acknowledges that the effects of the drought are not simply confined to farmers and their families. This government package supports the base on which rural Australia rests&mdash;namely, the farmers. The nature of the support is to be provided through the drought relief payment such that money will flow through families directly into rural towns. Direct income to meet day-to-day living expenses has a multiplier effect of around 1.5, meaning that every dollar spent generates around $1.50 in the broader economy, much of which will be retained in country towns. </PARA>

<PARA>In 1948, in response to the destruction and brutality of two world wars, the international community drew up a statement of principle on the protection of fundamental human rights. It was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles stated in the declaration were set down in response to a period of intense global conflict&mdash;as the declaration itself states, in response to the disregard and contempt for human rights which resulted in acts so barbarous they outraged the conscience of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration makes clear that: recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. Australia played an important role in the postwar international diplomacy which led to the creation of the United Nations and the drafting of the declaration. We have remained committed to those fundamental principles. These principles are as central now to our national identity and international reputation as they were when we were able to contribute to their development almost half a century ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These basic rights are universal and cannot be limited by national or state boundaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia can feel proud of its record on human rights. However, we must also recognise that not all Australians have always enjoyed, or today enjoy, a full range of rights. We know that for many generations the nation's treatment of its indigenous population was less than praiseworthy, that Australian women faced very direct forms of discrimination, that those with a disability were judged not on what they could do but rather on a stereotype of what was perceived they could not do. Few would deny that many Australians still do not enjoy full equality of opportunity, free to live and advance their lives according to their abilities and judged only on merit. While we have much to be proud of, not everyone is treated with respect and fairness. </PARA>

This has been a controversial subject matter. In the public debate which has preceded the parliament's consideration of this bill a variety of arguments have been advanced. It has been claimed that Australia is being dictated to by foreign law-making bodies and that our national sovereignty has been diminished. Others assert that the real issue is the rights of state governments and that the Commonwealth should not contemplate such a law. Some allege the law will render inoperative laws dealing with incest or the regulation of the sex industry. I will address each of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the bill does not represent the outcome of some process of abdication of national sovereignty. On the contrary, the fact that our national parliament is now debating this bill itself puts lie to that claim. One of the basic decisions made at Federation, indeed a reason for federation, was that the Australian people should speak with one voice internationally. That is why this parliament was given the power to act in relation to external affairs and why the pursuit of Australia's international interests is an executive function of the national government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Participation by Australia in bilateral and multilateral agreements is a free sovereign choice by this nation. It is a long process, which involves consultation within Australia and generally prolonged negotiation at the international level. The consultation process takes place in accordance with principles agreed between the Commonwealth and the states. It involves consultation at all levels including heads of government, the Standing Committee on Treaties comprising senior Commonwealth and state officials, and directly through relevant functional areas. For human rights, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General plays a consultative role. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia acceded to the optional protocol to the covenant in 1991. This followed a decade of consultation with the states and territories, including discussions by ministers on human rights and later by attorneys-general. The majority of jurisdictions, including Tasmania, did not object to Australia's becoming a party to the optional protocol. It was this optional protocol process which highlighted the inconsistency of particular sections of the criminal code of Tasmania with the protection from arbitrary interference with privacy detailed in article 17 of the international covenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government fully recognises the importance of such consultations, particularly in areas of shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states and territories such as human rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been misrepresentation of the impact the ratification of a treaty has on domestic law. The fact is that treaties are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. They cannot alone impose obligations on individuals or create rights in domestic law. This means that the rights prescribed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights only become part of Australian law through the passage of legislation by an Australian parliament and through the decisions of Australian courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this bill and this debate are evidence of that very point. Before joining a treaty, consideration is given to whether legislation is necessary; if so, whether existing federal or state legislation is adequate and, if not, whether the treaty should be implemented by legislation at Commonwealth or state/ territory level. Often no change of law is called for, or the Commonwealth relies on state and territory laws to carry out the provisions of treaties. </PARA>

Its decisions do not oblige any action from Australia to change our laws or alter our practices. While the government does believe that the views expressed by the committee have weight and should be regarded seriously, this committee cannot alter Australian law. By allowing complaints to the Human Rights Committee, Australia affords its citizens an avenue to explore whether our good record on human rights is being maintained.

The constitution also provides that if a Commonwealth and state law are inconsistent then the state law is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency.

The effect of these two sections together is that adult homosexual men in Tasmania are committing an offence if they participate in virtually any sort of sexual conduct together in the privacy of their own homes. These Tasmanian laws apply to acts in private as well as in public. They draw no distinction between conduct involving children and conduct involving only adults. Consent of the parties is irrelevant. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 17 of the international covenant does not provide that the right to be free from interference with privacy is absolute or unlimited. The article explicitly recognises that in some circumstances it is legitimate to intrude into the privacy of individuals. The article provides that no-one will be subjected to any `arbitrary interference' with privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key word in this test is `arbitrary'. The term `arbitrary' guarantees that where laws do intrude on people's privacy the laws must be justified, necessary and reasonable in the circumstances. In order to meet this test, a law must have a legitimate purpose and be a proportional means to achieve that purpose. All such laws must pay due regard to the rights and dignity of the individual. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill recognises and incorporates these limits. The bill deals only with sexual conduct in private between consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate and fully justifiable to have laws which regulate sexual conduct in public, sexual conduct involving children and sexual conduct to which a person does not consent. Expressly, the bill does not affect these laws. Such laws exist throughout Australia and are acceptable because they rest on an appropriate balance between the right to privacy in one's sexual conduct and the interests of the community at large. Indeed, such laws exist in Tasmania quite apart from sections 122 and 123 of the criminal code and deal in a much more balanced and appropriate way with sexual conduct which impacts unacceptably on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The age of consent for sexual activity varies across the states and territories and also varies depending on whether heterosexual or male homosexual activity is involved. The government recognises that there is not a consensus across Australia on the question of an appropriate age of consent. The bill does not prevent states and territories from setting the age of consent below 18 years of age. The bill deals with sexual conduct involving those of or above the age of 18. It is generally recognised across Australia that by the age of 18 people are expected to be mature enough to make a range of decisions for themselves and to take responsibility for themselves and their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws which seek to regulate the private consensual conduct of those over 18 will not be affected unless they are an arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of article 17. There are a broad range of laws across Australia which deal with private sexual conduct of adults. All jurisdictions, for example, make incest a criminal offence. There is clearly a consensus throughout Australia that such laws are justified on medical and other grounds even when they cover conduct between consenting adults. Such laws seek to prevent children being conceived by parents whose genetic make-up is harmfully close. The laws also recognise and protect the special nature of the relationship between grandparents, parents, children and siblings, for example. The laws are limited in their scope, relating only to very close relationships. They are reasonable and proportional. They draw an appropriate balance between the needs of the community and the rights of the individual. Such laws will not be affected by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sex industry in Australia is also regulated. States and territories have sought to deal with the commercial, community and health issues involved with the industry in a variety of ways. Appropriate regulation of the sex industry is not, however, an arbitrary interference with privacy. It is a necessary, justified and reasonable regulation of the industry. Some laws, however, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be described as justified, reasonable and proportionate. Sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code fall into this category and in doing so have placed us in breach of our international obligations and jeopardised our high standing in matters of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not a servile capitulation to the views of some international body. It is a statement of this government's belief in and support for the standards enshrined in the international covenant. The bill is not an invasion of the sovereign rights of state governments. State governments, like governments everywhere, have a duty to protect the rights of the individuals within their jurisdiction in conformity with recognised international standards. Where a state government fails in this duty, the Commonwealth obligation to act is clear. I believe that this bill is a significant step in guaranteeing the protection of the freedom from intrusion by government in the most intimate details of one's personal private life.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will guarantee a right to privacy for consenting sexual activity between adults in private. The coalition has a longstanding and strong commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals. At the last election we stated in our law and justice policy:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition puts a high priority on the right to privacy, especially the right to privacy against government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After careful consideration of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, the coalition has decided that the balance must come down on the side of protection of individual privacy in this instance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Federal Government to reform the treaty making process so that the Commonwealth Parliament, the State and Territory governments, and the community are properly consulted on the content and implications of treaties. </PARA>
<PARA>I notice that today, in his very comprehensive address, the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has addressed some of these matters, as he did on a radio program which I heard this morning. I am one who takes an interest in matters relating to human rights. I note the Attorney-General's comments that Australia can feel proud of its record on human rights. He then goes on to point out a number of areas in which Australia may not necessarily have addressed those matters fully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night in this parliamentary building there was an address by the Secretary-General of Amnesty International, Mr Pierre Sane, in which he made comments on us all. It is particularly interesting to me as one who recently attended, as did some of the Attorney-General's advisers, the international conference on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an international context, for what I believe are essentially fairly base political motives of the government about human rights issues, Australia now sees its advocacy of some of these matters to be in conflict with its ability to enter into dialogue with other countries and other parties interested in human rights issues. The consequence of that, of course, has been that we have seen some very interesting modifications of Australia's public position on a number of international human rights matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note particularly the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Seattle. He suggested that President Clinton ought to be modifying the view of the United States on human rights stands, particularly in relation to Indonesia. At the world conference on human rights it was very obvious that the Attorney-General was also reading down Australia's long-term commitments, I suspect because some members of the government believe that we are now finding it more difficult to get elected to particular international bodies. One of the international bodies that the government might have in mind for the future, and where our human rights advocacy might jeopardise a seat, is the United Nations Security Council. I always find it interesting when people argue about Australia's record on human rights as if it had an element of greater virtue than that of others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That prompts me to comment on the discussions about the way in which treaties are entered into. I do not disagree with the basic analysis that the Attorney-General has outlined, except to say that in all of these matters it is necessary to look at the way in which processes that have been in place over a long period of time have been undertaken. It was interesting that in relation to some of the basic human rights documents, of course, there were very lengthy consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General referred to the Liberal-National government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. It did so after a long period of discussion with the states. I know that the Fraser government put great store by those consultations and entered reservations quite frequently because of the nature of those consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference was made here to Australia acceding to the optional protocol following a decade of consultation. I suspect that that reference was put in to indicate that the government was applying the same standard. But I think it comes out very clearly in the Attorney-General's speech that the government sees these things in a different way from the coalition when the Attorney-General makes the point that a right to consultation does not mean a right to veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that it should mean a right to veto, but it comes down to a question of where the balance lies when consultation is undertaken and whether those discussions are entered into seriously with a view to recognising the particular concerns that exist, not only with state governments but with many other organisations that ought to be consulted. A number of organisations in the business community and so on have been making it clear to the government that they believe that consultation these days is very much a matter of form rather than a genuine desire to bring people on board to reach a reasonable consensus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this question of where the balance lies is a very important one. While I am not bringing into doubt the commitments that ought to be accorded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in the context of some of the other treaties that are accorded recognition these days there is a proper view that ought to be acknowledged that greater consultation would give greater credibility to the treaty making process and to the treaties themselves, would bring more people on board and would lead to more ready acceptance of the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in that context that people are suggesting that the parliament&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that it is at the moment the executive that has the power to conclude treaties&mdash;have a role at an earlier stage. That has taken me a little from the essence of this bill, which is contained in clause 4 and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) For the purposes of this section, an adult is a person who is 18 years old or more.</PARA>
<PARA>The essence of this bill provides a basic human right to Australians: the right to individual privacy. There are, however, limitations to clause 4. It states that it relates only to sexual conduct, not to a wider right of privacy that exists under article 17. The reference to `consent' means that the clause does not relate to any non-consensual activities such as rape or where a person is incapable of consenting&mdash;for example, a mentally disabled person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause does not apply to sexual conduct between an adult and a person under the age of 18, or two or more people under the age of 18. The reference to `acting in private' means that the clause does not affect laws concerning gross indecency in a public place&mdash;laws that exist in virtually all jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long title of this bill states that its purpose is `to implement Australia's international obligations under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights'. However, the purpose of the bill is to implement only a limited category of Australia's obligations under article 17, being those that relate to sexual conduct involving consenting adults acting in private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is that Australia ratified the covenant in 1980. The covenant contains many basic human rights such as the right to life, liberty, freedom from torture, freedom of expression, thought and conscience, and the right to privacy and equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 2 provides that parties to the international covenant undertake to respect and ensure to all individuals within their territories the rights recognised by the covenant, without distinction of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 2 also obliges the parties to legislate or take other necessary measures to give effect to the rights in the international covenant where they are not already provided for by existing legislative or other measures. Finally, it obliges parties to provide to any person whose rights under the international covenant have been violated an effective remedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of the international covenant were not enshrined in legislation when ratified first by Australia in 1980. This was on the basis that existing Australian law provides sufficient protection for individuals. However, there is no express legislative right to freedom of speech, privacy, equality before the law or many of the other rights recognised in the international covenant. Accordingly, there is often no effective domestic remedy for Australians when rights under the international covenant are breached, contrary to the requirements of article 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia acceded to the first optional protocol of the international covenant in 1991. This gave Australians the ability to complain directly to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in Geneva if they considered their rights under the international covenant had been breached. However, a complaint can be made only once an individual has exhausted all domestic remedies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional position, as we understand it, is that currently the Commonwealth parliament has no direct power to legislate in relation to privacy. That is why the government is relying upon its external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the constitution to give support to the legislation. It is understood that a law which implements the international treaty, to which Australia is a signatory, is a law in relation to external affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this bill does not fully implement the whole of the international covenant, or even the whole of article 17. Doubts have also been raised about whether partial implementation of article 17 is sufficient to enable use of the external affairs power. This situation is not dissimilar to the Franklin dam case, in which a number of judges found that legislation implementing a treaty under the external affairs power need not implement the whole treaty provided that legislation were reasonably considered to be appropriate or conducive to the performance of the object of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this, the coalition believes that, although clause 4 is much narrower than article 17 of the international covenant, it does not detract from the obligations under the article or the overall convention and that therefore it would be most unlikely that any challenge to its constitutional validity would be successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought an opinion on this matter from Mr David Barnett QC, and he backs that assessment. He says two things. Firstly, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the bill would give rise to a valid act.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill would not affect the regulation of sexual conduct provided that such regulation is not an arbitrary interference with privacy. It follows that the bill would have no effect upon laws dealing with such matters as regulation of the sex industry, sexual conduct amounting to professional misconduct by a doctor, child pornography or sexual conduct in public. These matters would continue to be regulated by state law.</PARA>
<PARA>So we come to the question of why we have this legislation. The origins of this legislation can be traced back to the first optional protocol and when Mr Nick Toonen, from Hobart, sent a complaint to the UN Human Rights Committee. Mr Toonen's complaint was that sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code breached his right to privacy under article 17 of the international covenant and his right to equality before the law under article 26. Section 122 of the Tasmanian criminal code, to which Mr Toonen's complaint related says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any person who&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) has sexual intercourse with any other person against the order of nature; or . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is guilty of a crime.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 123 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any male person who, whether in public or private commits any indecent assault or any other act of gross indecency with another male person or procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with himself or any other male person is guilty of a crime.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Toonen was able to send his complaint directly to the UN Human Rights Committee without referring it first to an Australian court, because there was no Australian law implementing his right to privacy under the international covenant and hence there was no domestic legal remedy that he could take. The Human Rights Committee of the United Nations upheld Mr Toonen's complaint that Australia is in breach of its obligation under article 17. The committee's findings of 8 April 1994 were that Mr Toonen was entitled to an effective remedy according to article 2, and an effective remedy would be the repeal of sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Tasmanian government has decided against repealing these sections of the Tasmanian criminal code, this legislation now before the House will effectively give Mr Toonen the remedy requested by the UN Human Rights Committee, which I might say brings me to the point made by the Attorney in relation to these matters. He commented on section 109 of the constitution, which renders ineffective any state law to the extent that there may be inconsistency with a Commonwealth enactment. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implication of the views now expressed by many&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the opposition is that Commonwealth laws should be read down so that state laws are not affected.</PARA>
<PARA>I might say that I think it would be more appropriate to say `some'. I do not know that that view is appropriately ascribed to many. I understand the operation of section 109 and the way in which this legislation would ensure that the Tasmanian law would be struck down only to the extent of any inconsistency with the Commonwealth's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position on this matter is that we have had a long and proud record in relation to human rights and guarding the privacy of individuals, particularly against intervention by governments. The coalition has always taken stands against invasion of privacy by governments. It might be timely to remind people of some instances. We took a stand against the Hawke government's attempt to introduce an identity card, and I think we effectively foiled that measure. The coalition has been forthright in its criticism of the government's data matching programs in particular and has ensured the maintenance of some sunset clauses to bring data matching to an end if the process cannot be shown to be efficacious. I have to say that, even with reports tabled yesterday by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), one doubts whether the financial efficacy that is argued by the government as being present has been clearly substantiated at this time. The coalition has always argued that individuals should have the right to join or not to join unions, whereas the government denies freedom of association with its duplicitous backing of forced union membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move on to other matters about which I think it is appropriate to draw some inferences. It was in 1973 in this parliament that a motion was moved by a former Liberal Prime Minister, Sir John Gorton, rejecting criminal sanctions for homosexual activity and seeking intervention here in the Australian Capital Territory, where the Commonwealth had legislative competence. John Gorton's motion was supported by a number of people who still sit in this House, two of them being the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), members of the National Party. I supported that motion myself by my own vote on that matter. But what was particularly interesting to me and a number of my colleagues was that it was the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who, amongst those who presently sit in this House, was recorded as voting against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in 1976, 18 years ago, that Bob Ellicott, the then Attorney-General, effectively decriminalised homosexual activity in the Australian Capital Territory by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is time we acknowledged that this conduct ought not to be the subject of the criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA>If the coalition's human rights record is compared with that of the government, it will be found that the government's approach on these matters has been nothing but inconsistent and hypocritical. The Hawke government's attempt to introduce the Australia card showed double standards in relation to individual privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only yesterday the coalition opposed a migration bill which sought to retrospectively validate what was an unlawful detention. The bill is an assault on the principle of the operation of the rule of law to protect civil liberties and it violates individual rights. It is a matter about which the government is almost salivating at the prospect of having a double dissolution issue, as it seeks to retrospectively validate unlawful detention, a very significant example of double standards on the government's part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, in acting to prevent states from allowing voluntary student unionism, the government is in our view acting in breach of the freedom of association provisions of the international covenant. So the government ought not to be crowing, as it appears to be, about these matters, because its record on a number of them evidences an inconsistent and hypocritical approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, as I mentioned earlier, was faced with a difficult decision between two fundamental principles: privacy and the proper division of federal powers under the constitution. It needs to be clearly understood that the opposition believes that Australia has a proud and active record of involvement and leadership in promoting cooperation between members of the international community. We are absolutely committed to that objective. Our record in government was testimony to that commitment. That was amply demonstrated by the Attorney-General's comments today about the Fraser government's involvement in the international covenant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under this Labor government, international treaties are being used as a constitutional battering ram to change the balance of power in the federation. The process of proper consultation with this parliament, with the states and with the broader community has broken down and ought to be restored to the genuine consultation that took place under the Fraser government. We will be working to restore such an approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want it to be understood&mdash;and make no mistake about this&mdash;that this issue of the role of international treaties in changing the nature of the federal division of powers is a significant one.

It is only in the context of this particular issue, where there are two principles at stake which are basically in conflict, that on balance we have decided that our commitment to privacy of the individual must be paramount.

There has, however, been a very nasty, bigoted, misinformed and vitriolic selective letterboxing campaign conducted in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some deranged comments have been made on handwritten, photocopied slips of paper which have found their way into the letterboxes of some of my constituents, and I apologise to them for that. Let me quote to the parliament what was said in those little notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Voters of Bass&mdash;we pay Silvia Smith to represent our views in Canberra. But she wants to impose foreign laws onto us. If we lose our anti-sodomy laws in Tasmania then Silvia Smith should lose her seat in Bass and many politicians must be tried for treason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not want an alien dictatorship.</PARA>
<PARA>This provides an example of the misinformed and reactionary nature of this debate. Let me make it very clear to the parliament, and especially to the people of Tasmania, exactly what it is that this bill will do. This bill means that sexual conduct in private and between consenting adults will not be the subject of interference with privacy by the law of the Commonwealth, the states or the territories. It does nothing more and nothing less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this debate has been the scaremongering and the misinformation which have been propagated. The first element of this has been the idiotic perception that the age of consent will be lowered to 14 years or even less. There is no pro-homosexual conspiracy aimed at luring young people into such a lifestyle. Such a suggestion is bigoted and ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current age of consent for sexual activity differs from state to state. It also differs depending on whether heterosexual or male homosexual activity is involved. This bill does not impact upon the ability of the states to set their own age of consent for sexual activity. All this bill deals with is the sexual conduct of those over the age of 18 years. It is certainly generally accepted that by the age of 18 people are mature enough to make a range of life decisions and are responsible for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People must accept and realise that this bill does not, is not intended to, and will not impinge upon the age of consent for sexual activity. Unfortunately, this argument has been used as an emotive deception by anti-homosexual groups such as Tasalert, and it is an insidious attempt to enlist the support of moderate-thinking people to their bigoted cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further argument of the detractors of this bill is that it will open the floodgates for all sorts of currently unlawful sexual offences to be conducted in private. Absolutely 100 per cent no way! Australian laws which regulate the consenting private sexual acts of Australian adults will be impinged upon only if they interfere with privacy within the meaning of article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many just and necessary laws throughout Australia which deal with private sexual acts between adults. We have heard some of those mentioned here today. The laws dealing with incest are a very good example. All Australian jurisdictions make incest a criminal offence, and rightly so. Everyone recognises the need to seek to prevent children being conceived by parents of a close genetic nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument has been used by the detractors of this bill that it will enable this sort of activity. The bigots fail on this count as well. None of these necessary regulatory laws will be impacted upon. The justified medical and other grounds upon which they are based will stand firm. The floodgates will not be opened for the type of sexual behaviour which is controlled by these very necessary laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been stated that this bill represents the beginning of the end of regulation of the sex industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Regulation of the sex industry is, again, highly appropriate and is not an arbitrary interference with privacy. This regulation is necessary and justified and will not be impinged upon one iota by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major arguments in this debate is the contention that this bill will allow&mdash;and, indeed, promote&mdash;acts of public indecency. To hear some of the more rabid opponents of law reform in this area, one might think this bill will allow homosexual acts to be committed at every street corner, park and bus stop in the land. It is certainly unfortunate that these people have been taken seriously and their arguments listened to. I suppose that I have to refute even this ludicrous contention, just for the record. Public acts of homosexuality will still be dealt with by the law, just as public heterosexual acts will be dealt with. Any public sexual act is an act of indecency and should be dealt with as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania currently, as we have heard, sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code mean that it is a criminal offence for two consenting adults, whether homosexual or heterosexual, to have anal sex in private. These provisions go on to make all other `indecent practices' between men a criminal offence. When it all comes down to it, this means that adult homosexual men in Tasmania are breaking the law if they engage in virtually any type of sexual contact together in the privacy of their own homes. These laws draw no distinction between acts in private and acts in public. There is no differentiation between conduct involving children and that involving adults. Consent is not taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state clearly for the record that not only is it justified but it is also necessary and desirable to have laws dealing with any sexual conduct in public, with sexual conduct involving children and with sexual conduct with those who do not consent. Such laws exist throughout Australia. They maintain the balance between the right to privacy for sexual conduct and the interests, health and wellbeing of the general community. Let there be no mistake: well-balanced laws governing this type of conduct exist in Tasmania, totally independent of sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. In fact, Tasmanian laws which deal with sexual conduct which impacts unacceptably on the community are excellent, and they will not be affected by this bill. I repeat: they will not be affected by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania's criminal code act was enacted in 1924. Sections 122 and 123 are anachronistic and are regarded as such by most Tasmanians. The Tasmanian state government has been asked to remove these sections of the act. This would be a far more desirable way to effect the outcome we will gain by passing the legislation which is before us today. Only a few years ago, the former Tasmanian state Labor government passed a bill through the lower house which had the intention of repealing the offending provisions. Unfortunately, the legislation was not passed by the upper house of the Tasmanian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been much talk throughout this entire debate on whether it is desirable for Australia to be party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I myself have received letters which state that Australia should not be party to this treaty and that complying with its measures impinges upon the rights of the states to make their own laws. Unfortunately, the states rights argument has been used again in this debate in an endeavour to gain the support of fair-minded and moderate people who happen to love their own state and thus to involve them in the lowest form of politics: the politics of bigotry and hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us examine exactly what article 17 of the international covenant does bind us to and think about whether it is desirable or not. This covenant protects the following: the right to life; the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the right to freedom from arbitrary interference with privacy; the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention; the right to freedom of movement; the right to equality before the law; the right to a fair trial; and the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask members of the House to consider today whether any fair-minded Australian would not want to be associated with, and indeed bound by, principles such as those I have just mentioned. When some considerations are made in certain quarters on the opposite side of the House about what they intend to do with this bill when this bill comes to a vote, they would be wise to consider the principles that I have just listed. Otherwise, they would be voting down some of the philosophies that got many of them into this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make something clear. These international obligations have not been imposed upon Australia. They are obligations which were freely accepted in 1980 by the Fraser government, as stated earlier here by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) in his opening lines. This was not something done in a back room as part of a dark and secret deal; it was done with full consultation with the states and the territories. It took 10 years before Australia became a signatory to the optional protocol. No-one can level the allegation that the signing of this international treaty was done in a closed way in order to dupe the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's obligations under this treaty raise no question of undermining Australian sovereignty, contrary to what has been stated by certain quarters in this debate. The views of the UN Human Rights Committee do not have force of law in Australia. Make no mistake: this is our decision. This legislation is reflective of a decision of this government to take action. It may have been stimulated by the UN Human Rights Committee, but it is still no-one else's decision but this government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument has been raised that the federal government should have defended the Tasmanian position in the international arena. All arguments put forward by the Tasmanian government were certainly considered when the Human Rights Committee considered the case, but let us look at the facts. The Tasmanian government's stance is directly opposed to Commonwealth policy and to the practice in every other state in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments of the Tasmanian state government are fundamentally flawed. The arguments used stated that these laws protect Tasmania from the spread of HIV. The Tasmanian state government tried to dress up these archaic and homophobic laws as being valid on the grounds of public health and moral decency. Quite the reserve is true. It is well documented that these types of laws directly obstruct the health programs which are aimed at limiting the spread of HIV, and they do this by driving underground the very people who are most at risk. Would you openly seek medical testing for HIV if you thought that it could land you in gaol? I certainly would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me finish with a local perspective on this issue. Tasmanians are not uniformly rednecks and homophobic. I can assure this House that those who have been very vocal in Tasmania against homosexual reform are very much in the minority. In my own electorate of Bass public meetings called on this issue have had very poor attendances. I am sad to say that the level of public opposition to homosexual law has been beaten up, largely by the mainland media, simply because over-the-top bigotry is a good story. I must add, however, that the Tasmanian media people have been very responsible in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk principally about the government's motives in introducing this bill, the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994. The government has not introduced this bill because it is concerned about privacy. The government has not introduced this bill because it is concerned about Australia's international obligations. What the introduction of the bill does is to demonstrate that this government does not really care about individual rights, it does not care about the federal division of responsibilities and it does not care about Australia's obligations as an international citizen. The bill is in fact a cynical and transparent attempt by the government to curry favour, to grab votes, to further centralise power in the federal government and to try to divide the coalition. These are the real motives behind the government's actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give some background to this bill to expose the government's motives. In 1980 Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and it became, as a result, a party to that covenant. As a party, Australia becomes bound under article 2 of the international covenant to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as set out in the covenant are violated shall have an effective remedy. That remedy should be provided and enforceable not by international law but by municipal law, which means in this case by Australia's own legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia does not have and never has had any legislation under which a person can bring an action in an Australian court for a remedy for a breach of the rights guaranteed to that person in the international covenant. The remedy need not, of course, be in that direct form and preferably would not be. Many of the rights guaranteed under the covenant are in fact dealt with by the common law or by acts of state parliaments. Many of those protections were part of our laws long, long before the international covenant was even drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 December 1991 Australia's accession to the first optional protocol to the international covenant took effect. Australia's accession entitles individuals in this country with complaints about claimed breaches of the international covenant to take those complaints to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. A person can take a complaint to the Human Rights Committee only if he or she has exhausted all domestic remedies for the claimed breach in his or her country. Where there are no domestic remedies available in Australia for a claimed breach of the rights and freedoms contained in the covenant, people in Australia may, therefore, take their complaints directly to the committee for determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Nick Toonen, a homosexual living in Tasmania, took a complaint to the Human Rights Committee in December 1991. His complaint was about sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code. Those sections provide that any person who engages in sodomy with a person of either sex, or any male person who engages in acts of gross indecency with another male person, is guilty of a crime. Mr Toonen complained to the Human Rights Committee that those laws breached, among other things, his right to privacy under article 17 of the international covenant. Article 17 gives people in a state that is a party to the covenant a broad and general right to protection of their privacy from arbitrary or unlawful interference. It is worth quoting it in full:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.</PARA>
<PARA>On 8 April 1994, the Human Rights Committee published its views, upholding Mr Toonen's complaint and finding that Australia was in breach of its obligations under article 17. The Tasmanian government has not repealed the criticised laws and has made it clear that it does not intend to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government is not legislating to fulfil its obligations under the international covenant and provide a remedy at Australian law for anyone who claims that his or her rights are being breached by the Tasmanian laws. Instead, the government has introduced this bill. The government makes two important claims about what this bill will do. First, it says that this is a privacy bill and that this government wants to secure individual rights. Secondly, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his government sanctimoniously say that this bill fulfils Australia's obligations as a party to the covenant and thus is vital to its standing as a good international citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claims made by the government for the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill camouflage its real reasons. First, this bill is not really about privacy. It does not implement all of the provisions of article 17. The bill refers to sexual conduct between consenting adults in private and says that there should be no arbitrary interference with that conduct. The bill does nothing for the concerns of many individuals about the increasing and unwarranted encroachment by this government and by administrative bodies on the private and business affairs of ordinary Australians. The only form of privacy that the bill protects from arbitrary interference is the privacy of consenting adults to engage in sexual conduct. If the government were serious about protecting Australians' rights to privacy, as it is bound to do under the international covenant, it would deal with privacy rather than with sexual conduct alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case the contrary is suggested, let me say also that this bill is not a bill about homosexual law reform. It does not pretend to protect the rights of homosexual people, whether male or female, as such, or to prevent discrimination on the grounds of sexual preference. Informed people have recognised that this bill really is a cynical attempt by the government to appease members of the homosexual community and secure their votes without offering social reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Tasmanian laws are wrong. In fact, they are inconsistent with the Liberal Party's federal platform. The platform calls for understanding of, and respect for, individual conscience and moral judgment and for a recognition of the individual's right to live according to those judgments. It is the philosophy of the Liberal Party that controls over the free actions of the individual should be avoided unless there is clear evidence that the equal rights of others or the protection of the community requires the imposition of controls. It is not the role of a government or of a political party to impose moral judgments on individuals where there is no public interest in the results of the exercise of those judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sexual practices of consenting adults in private, in my view, come within that principle. The principle can accommodate both those who approve and those who disapprove, for whatever reason, of homosexual conduct or unorthodox sexual practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that I believe the Tasmanian laws should be repealed, but I believe that the Tasmanian government should be the one to repeal them. The federal government should not intervene legislatively to render the laws ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another major reason why the government's claims in respect of the bill camouflage the real reasons is that this bill does not discharge the obligations Australia undertook when it ratified the covenant. The government has made no attempt to provide a domestic remedy within the Australian legal system for alleged breaches of an individual's rights under the international covenant. In this way the Commonwealth government remains in breach of its obligations under article 2. In fact, the proper way for the obligations to be implemented would involve actions by state governments. Until the Toonen case decision, the government made no attempt whatever to have state governments take steps to fulfil the obligations under the covenant. If there were domestic remedies, enforceable by Australian courts, there would be no need for the involvement of United Nations bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the Human Rights Committee in the Toonen case have brought adverse publicity to Australia. This publicity has been described by one commentator as `to all intents and purposes a potent declaration of international delinquency'. This is most regrettable and, unfortunately, impacts on Australia's credibility in international forums promoting human rights. It has served to highlight the continuing concern of many Australians, including the members of the coalition parties, with the way this government blithely ratifies and accedes to international treaties and protocols without proper regard to their contents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the executive branch of government signs an international treaty, it is incurring on behalf of the nation the obligation set out in that treaty. This is similar to an ordinary person signing a contract. A person can get out of a contract only if all the other parties to it agree. At law, a treaty can be signed on behalf of the nation only by the executive branch of government. In practice, parliament has no involvement unless legislation is needed to implement the treaty. The states may be consulted on occasions, but consultation is not mandatory. Nor is the approval of the states required before the Commonwealth ratifies a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems with international treaties is that in their terms they often fail to recognise adequately the nature of a federal state. By becoming party to a treaty, Australia may assume obligations that it needs the cooperation of the states to perform. The international covenant is a particular example of this. One of the advisory committees to the Constitutional Commission recommended that a treaties council be established to enhance parliament's role in the treaty making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the occasion to discuss that recommendation in detail; I mention it merely to show that I am not the only one who is concerned about the consequences of the government's lack of consultation with others before it assumes the significant burden of international duties and obligations. In fact, industry groups have recently issued two major press releases: one in January from eight peak bodies led by the Business Council of Australia; another, I think, in April by 11 peak bodies again led by the Business Council. In them they expressed concern about the impact of treaties on business&mdash;treaties which have been entered into without consultation or, in some cases, without the knowledge of industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interests of all relevant parties including the states should be considered and taken into account before the Commonwealth enters into a treaty. If this is done, the government should have the support of the entire community to satisfy the second need, namely, for parliament to give legislative implementation to all aspects, not just selected narrow areas, of all the international treaties into which Australia has entered. The coalition cares about responsibilities, not just individual responsibilities but also our responsibilities as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill uses section 109 of the constitution effectively to override Tasmanian laws. Where a Commonwealth law and a state law are inconsistent, the Commonwealth law prevails and the state law is invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. So that part of the Tasmanian anti-sodomy laws that is an arbitrary interference with private adult consensual sexual conduct will be rendered invalid by this bill if it becomes law. The Commonwealth does not have the constitutional power to legislate with respect to human rights or sexual conduct or privacy. It relies on the scope of the external affairs power contained in section 51(xxix) of the constitution to support the legislation. This bill is really the most recent of transparent attempts by the Commonwealth to use the existence of a treaty to trample on the delicate balance of federal-state legislative powers. The use of this device by the Commonwealth should be understood as having a serious and damaging effect on federal-state relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to comment briefly on some parts of the terms of the bill. The bill speaks of `arbitrary interference' and says that phrase has the meaning it is given in article 17 of the international covenant. Ultimately, the meaning of the phrase will be a question for the High Court to determine. The bill is drafted to ensure that the High Court will interpret the expression in the light of the interpretation of it by the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. It is by no means certain what the High Court will decide constitutes an arbitrary interference and what does not. That uncertainty is an undesirable result of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable concern in the community. It has been mentioned that the Human Rights Committee will in fact make decisions binding Australians. For my part, I do not accept that. The High Court will form its own opinion. At its highest, it will have regard to decisions of the Human Rights Committee. In the light of the terms of the bill, it will probably be important for the High Court to take account of decisions by the Human Rights Committee in that respect but it certainly should never be bound by them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Human Rights Committee itself warrants particular comment. By the standards of the Australian legal system, the finding in the Toonen case was made in breach of the rules of natural justice, in breach of the rules of procedural fairness. Although the laws in question were Tasmanian laws, the Commonwealth, as the party to the international covenant, was the defendant to the complaint by Mr Toonen. The Commonwealth did not defend the Tasmanian laws and so the Tasmanian government was effectively condemned in its absence. The crucial parts of the committee's findings were conceded by the Australian government in its submissions to the committee. Australia admitted that Mr Toonen had been a victim of an arbitrary interference with his privacy and that the Tasmanian laws cannot be justified on public health or moral grounds. It is therefore not surprising the Human Rights Committee made the findings that it did. It would be very wrong to tie the interpretation of the crucial phrase in this bill to the determination of a committee that conducts its hearings in that</PARA>

I do not believe that this government or any state government has any right to tell an Australian citizen what form of sexual conduct he will have within his own home.

It is a gross intrusion into the basic rights of every Australian citizen. If this coalition were to honour some of the traditions which exist within their own party, whereby they were on many occasions prepared to lead the argument and not follow it, they should have said to their Tasmanian colleagues, `You will not have our support; we will not be coming into the parliament to talk about the complex balance between state rights and federal rights.'</PARA>

Why is it that there are no raids on private bedrooms to arrest people? The answer is simple: they know the law is wrong and that it is an intrusion which should not be accepted in any state in the Commonwealth and that it will not be accepted by right-thinking and decent Tasmanians. They know that. But they also know there is a homophobic group in Tasmania whose religious beliefs are such that they want to proscribe all these activities, and they do not want to offend that group. </PARA>

Let me say this: I do not believe that in a modern, plural, democratic society like Australia there is any Australian citizen&mdash;whatever their sexual preference or religious beliefs&mdash;who should be treated as a second-class citizen.

Considering the terms of the legislation and the propaganda that has ensued from Tasmania, we are told that Tasmania is under threat. It is not as if it is bad enough that you have this legislation on the statute books; listening to some of the spokesmen on behalf of the Tasmanian government you would almost believe that, if these odious provisions were repealed, it would be almost compulsory for you to become a homosexual.

That is what has occurred. It is the height of hypocrisy to come in here and make comments like `Well, I've got a terrible problem in balancing states rights' and accuse the government and the Attorney of all kinds of hidden motives when the issue, as I have said, is comparatively simple.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not about the morality or the immorality of homosexuality. This bill is about the right of consenting adults to conduct a sexual relationship free from government interference. I would ask those who would have the government impose moral behaviour on individuals to consider the words of a participant in the debate that preceded the decriminalisation of homosexuality in England. The debate took place in the 1950s. I will quote from the words of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Fisher:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of my correspondents boldly writes to me, `So far as possible, every sin should be declared a crime'&mdash;which is precisely the belief of the totalitarian state, which defines its own sense of sin and then makes it a crime. I am afraid that there is a very common belief that only crimes are sins and that the not illegal is therefore lawful and right.</PARA>
<PARA>At this point, the Archbishop is referring to the heterosexual sins of fornication and adultery. The Archbishop continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The State and the law are not concerned directly, as the Church is, with saving the souls of men from their own destruction. The right to decide one's own moral code and obey it, even to a man's own hurt, is a fundamental right of man, given him by God.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only add to the Archbishop's words by reiterating that, by allowing this bill to pass through the House, I am not promoting homosexuality; I am merely sanctioning the right of each of us to make and live by our own decisions.

I understand that his son, Robert, who is now the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, had a hand in drafting the bill. Murray Hill made it clear that he did not personally believe homosexuality was morally acceptable; however, he was motivated&mdash;in the face of significant condemnation of his actions&mdash;by what he believed to be his responsibility as a representative of the people.

<PARA>In accordance with what he believed to be his duty as a representative of the people, Murray Hill undertook to do away with the laws which made homosexuality a crime and which legitimised the persecution of the homosexual minority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more disturbing aspects of the community debate that has preceded this bill has been the willingness of some organisations to play on people's fears by misrepresenting the implications of this bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proscribes arbitrary government interference in sex between consenting adults in private. The fact that both the participants in the sexual act being referred to must be adults&mdash;and, further, must be consenting adults&mdash;means that this bill will not override state laws relating to rape and sexual assault on minors. Further, the fact that the government interference being proscribed is arbitrary interference means that this bill will have no effect upon the state laws dealing with regulation of the sex industry, sexual conduct amounting to professional misconduct by a doctor, child pornography or sexual conduct in public since all these laws can be justified as necessary to preserve the public good. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Tasmania has the lowest rate of HIV infection in Australia. However, the fact that South Australia, the first state to decriminalise homosexuality, also has a comparatively low rate of HIV infection suggests that the rate of HIV infection is not linked to the legal status of homosexuality.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having explained my reasons for not opposing this bill, there are issues which should be aired. This bill was drafted in response to a United Nations Human Rights Committee finding that parts of the Tasmanian criminal code breached the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The offending parts were those outlawing homosexuality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having signed and ratified this international treaty, Australia committed itself to ensuring that human rights standards set out in the treaty were observed in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of any willingness on the part of the Tasmanian government to reform those parts of its criminal code which breached the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as every other state and territory has done over the past 20 years, it has fallen to the Commonwealth government to create a law which addresses this breach. This has been done in the form of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. It has created a Commonwealth law which will indirectly override Tasmanian law. This bill creates the opportunity for homosexuals affected by state laws outlawing sex between consenting adult males in private to challenge these laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I understand what has caused the government to follow this path in this particular case, I cannot sanction the general trend towards centralised government. I point out that I am not opposed to Australia becoming a party to international treaties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Federation has proven, we are capable of a number of allegiances.

Indeed as Pierre Sane, Secretary-General of Amnesty International, has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We live in a global community. It is simply not possible in the 1990's for any nation to pretend that it exists in isolation, that its affairs are not directly affected in one thousand and one ways by the policies and actions of other nations. We are surrounded by the evidence of this interconnectedness: trade, transport, communications, migration, defence, drug enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not oppose our participation in international treaties. However, I am strongly opposed to the present government's use of these treaties. At the beginning of this century, the Australian people voted for the Australian colonies to federate. I would argue that Australians were instinctively suspicious of authority at this time, that they were therefore sympathetic to the idea of limited government and that they intended the states to be preserved for the purpose of checking the power of the new national government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade, Labor has shown scant regard for our federal system of government. It has consistently sought to extend its power beyond the limits imposed on it by the Australian people. One of the strategies that is being increasingly used towards this end involves the exploitation of the powers to sign and ratify treaties that presently reside with the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I do not oppose Australia's participation in international treaties. We do not sign away our sovereignty in such instances. While our participation in a treaty may suggest the need for our domestic laws to be changed, the actual power to do this, or not to do this, remains with the Australian parliament. However, it cannot be denied that Australia's standing in the international community is significantly damaged if our domestic laws breach the standards of a treaty which we have signed. It logically follows that the initial decision to enter into a treaty should be based on discussions which include both Commonwealth and state parliaments, since it is the agreement of these bodies which will ultimately be required if Australian domestic law needs to be changed to honour our commitments under an international treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is to this country's detriment that the present government has chosen to enter into treaties without any real effort to draw the Commonwealth and state parliaments into the decision. The government's method of consultation with the states has been grossly inadequate and its public consultation almost non-existent. The ratification of International Labour Organisation convention 158, contrary to the view of all but one of the states, is a case in point. I would argue that there is purpose to this madness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present Labor is using both its power to sign international treaties and its external affairs power to thwart the spirit of our federal system and to extend its powers into areas of state responsibility. If this is not the case, then I challenge the government to do as the coalition has said it will do in The Things That Matter; namely, to `reform Australia's international treaty making processes to ensure that the Australian parliament, the states, industry and the community are consulted' and to `ensure that there is a detailed public statement on the implications of international treaties on Australia's law, economy, environment and trade competitiveness before they are signed'. Labor has created a climate in which Australia does not enter treaties as a nation. Perhaps, inevitably, we are divided when the moment comes for us to alter our domestic laws in accordance with our treaty commitments. </PARA>

<PARA>The crime listed in the Tasmanian legislation is `unnatural sexual intercourse'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House today is directly inconsistent with the Tasmanian law and, accordingly, it will prevail under section 109 of the Australian constitution. The legislation has a sound constitutional base. It is a partial implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is a signatory. The federal parliament, through the external affairs power, is entitled&mdash;indeed obliged&mdash;to pass laws implementing Australia's treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The law passed by the Tasmanian parliament is outside the boundaries of good government. No government should be in the business of defining natural or unnatural acts of sexual intercourse. In a liberal democracy, government should not play the role of bedroom police. Acts of consenting adults&mdash;homosexuals and heterosexuals&mdash;engaging in anal and oral sex should be left in the bedroom as a question of choice between those persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the House that the Tasmanian criminal code is not just restricted to acts of homosexuality. It applies just as much to acts between consenting heterosexual adults. For that reason, the Tasmanian criminal code denies a large number of adult Tasmanians and visitors to Tasmania the choice of behavioural activities that one would normally expect in a democratic society. As I said, governments should not play the role of bedroom police in the homes of consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian criminal code seeks to repress an innate feature of human character&mdash;the freedom of consenting adults to choose their own mode of sexual behaviour. In history, repression of the innate features of people has been known as tyranny or fascism; that is, the restrictions governments have placed on freedoms of expression, movement and ethnic background. The Tasmanian code is no less offensive. To place a restriction on consenting adults, in the privacy of their own bedroom, to choose their mode of sexual behaviour, is as offensive in a liberal democracy as any of the restrictions associated with tyranny and fascism&mdash;freedom of expression, freedom of movement and freedom of ethnic background and expression. </PARA>

Just before question time when we are expecting the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), I am surprised that he is not on the speakers list, that he is not going to take an active part in this debate. One would have thought that on such an important principle that has invoked controversy in the community the Leader of the Opposition would set out his views on this issue and lead his party into debate. It is a shame, because on 8 June this year at the National Press Club the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . international treaties have been allowed to intrude into Australian domestic law without being sanctioned by the Australian people and without reference to Parliament . . . It is a question of whether Australian law is made in Australia by Australians and for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>At the National Press Club, he was asking for the sort of debate that parliament now has before it. He thought that these questions about international treaties should be debated by the parliament. But now that the opportunity for debate on this legislation has arisen he is nowhere to be seen.

He will not be providing the House of Representatives with the sorts of views and contributions that he said at the National Press Club were absolutely essential. </PARA>

Later on today or tomorrow morning some opposition members will be taking a long walk around Canberra and abstaining from the vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the Leader of the Opposition, in many ways, this is a long walk in its own right&mdash;a long walk in the snow of politics. The Liberal Party has to face up to the way in which the old rhetoric about states rights is now totally outdated in Australian politics. This legislation and the mixed response of the coalition is very much a turning point in the historic debate in Australia between human rights and states rights. Happily, states rights have now declined as a political force. </PARA>

How would the international environment look if he decided to wage a massive and destructive campaign, not just against Saudi Arabia, but also against Israel, with all of the retaliatory issues which such a course would invoke? A benign policy of appeasement now would be not only unjust but also dangerous and the family of nations would have to contemplate life in the international economy with up to 75 per cent of the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of most nations' commerce, in the hands of one malicious tyrant.

<PARA>I move this motion because the charges that have been levelled by the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, against the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) can be rated only as being amongst the most serious charges that can possibly be levelled against a Prime Minister of this country. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who, after all, worked for many years with the present Prime Minister, has asserted that the Prime Minister has lied to the Australian people.

If he refuses to establish his case in this, the most democratic of all chambers in Australia, we all know why. It is because if he misleads this parliament he will be forced to resign. </PARA>

I know it; you know it. We know who has not told the truth, do we not? We know that the Prime Minister has failed to tell the truth. This is a matter of profound embarrassment to the Leader of the House because Mr Hawke involved him in all the discussions about the Gulf War.

It is timely to quote just one sentence from the Prime Minister's first answer to Fran Kelly's first question. Fran had a busy day yesterday. I recall being interviewed by her on another matter&mdash;a nonsense agenda. Fran Kelly was still clever enough, late that day, to ask the Prime Minister about the Gulf War. He replied, `You know, we went into a meeting.' In response to Fran Kelly's first question about Bob Hawke, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did. That is just a straight lie, a straight distortion. There was only two Ministers at the original meeting&mdash;this was about whether we committed people to Desert Shield&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>One of the most important decisions any government can ever make with regard to its people is a decision to send people to war. It is a matter requiring a very serious resolution of both houses of parliament, a matter which, to its credit, the government of that day brought before both houses of parliament in a special January session. It is not something to be taken lightly. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that was Hawke, Michael Duffy, who was Acting Foreign Minister, and me. Without any notice, I was asked around, and he said I might get a call from the United States: What do you think we'll do?

<PARA>How arrogant! What absolutely sickening arrogance from the Prime Minister of the day. I think it is now time that the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) entered into this fray. The member for Holt sits with us today; he is not rostered off today. He is a noble backbencher. He is a person of some integrity. He is a person who should now take the opportunity to respond.

I am a man in the great traditions of the Liberal Party.' But for 10 years he has been running around nailing the moderates in the South Australian branch of the Liberal Party on every single one of the positions which he now says that he basically embraces and always has. He says, `Not that I have changed my mind, and not that I have become a better and more loving and caring and kindly human being, but I had one set of views then which were convenient and another set of views now which to my ambition are convenient.'</PARA>

A whole set of policy options will be put forward in the course of those discussions.

He has absolutely no problem in dealing with this issue. The opposition's position on this is absurdly confected. If you really thought these issues were serious, if you really thought that the country was in the hands of a person who had no fundamental understanding about the importance of our alliance relationships, who had been opposed to participation in the Gulf War and ought to have been supportive of it, you have had three months to deal with it. You have chosen not to. You have chosen not to avail yourselves of the opportunities that have been presented to you in question time to question the Prime Minister because you do not take your position on this seriously.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1812" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that, from time to time, one hears claims that large numbers of people are getting social security benefits of one form or another that they should not be. The government has implemented a range of measures to ensure that social security payments are properly targeted to those in need. An independent expert, Professor Weatherley, of Harvard University, reviewed the operation of our system. He published a report in 1993 which concluded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There likely was a compliance problem in the 1970s and early 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA>Guess who was in government then! The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the mid-1980s, a series of administrative and policy measures have been implemented&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">have effectively solved the compliance problem.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the outcome of an independent expert's review of the operation of our system. We have a system which in a good many respects is at the cutting edge in terms of its effectiveness in combating fraud and compliance problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an array of comprehensive front door measures to ensure that payments are granted correctly, recognising that people's circumstances can change. We had a comprehensive program of reviews conducted, totalling 2.3 million, in the last financial year. A total of 40,000 of those reviews were the result of allegations of incorrect payments by members of the public. All such allegations were followed up. Of the 2.3 million reviews, 7.6 per cent identified overpayments and 1.6 per cent identified underpayments. The net savings from this compliance effort and this review activity totalled $37 million per fortnight, or nearly a billion dollars in the course of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reviews are targeted at potential areas of risk that are identified in various ways so that the proportion of those that produce some variation in payment or eligibility does not reflect the general level of non-compliance. The evidence is overwhelming that the great bulk of people receiving social security payments are entitled to them and that those seeking to defraud the system are a tiny minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition say about those sorts of activities? On the one hand, the opposition leader recently  talked about the prospect of cuts being made in welfare in unspecified areas. On the other hand, the opposition spokesperson on social security matters seeks time and again, when legislation comes before the House, to ensure that the cost of measures, which in some cases is already substantial, such as the home child-care allowance, is pushed out further. He knows full well that his leader is committed to making cuts in that area. The hypocrisy of it all is quite phenomenal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we tabled the annual report of the data matching program, which confirmed that the savings as a result of that program amount to some $80 million in direct savings per year and about $120 million in indirect savings. We are talking about pretty close to $200 million worth of savings arising from the data matching program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the opposition, which professes to be concerned about tightening fiscal policy, do? Every time that legislation comes up for consideration, the opposition seeks to reimpose a sunset clause. The double standards and the hypocrisy of this whole exercise are quite phenomenal. This is just another example of the fact that the coalition has no credibility whatsoever when it comes to talking about tightened fiscal policy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. What steps is the government taking to ensure that children are protected from exposure to harmful or disturbing material from new sources of information and entertainment, such as computer bulletin boards?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1813" SPEAKER="Lavarch The Hon M.H." NAMEID="LG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="DICKSON" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY-GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members may be aware that last week the Minister for Communications and the Arts and I released a report of a task force of officers from our two departments which examined the appropriate regulation of computer bulletin boards. Members would be well aware of the recent censorship legislation which has passed the House of Representatives that deals with the classification system for films, videos and, more recently, computer games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, no classification system is in place for computer bulletin boards. The difficulty of simply applying the current regime to computer bulletin boards is quite obvious. Firstly, access to information on bulletin boards is gained via the telephone network. Regulation of such telephone traffic would raise serious privacy issues. The government clearly&mdash;and no doubt the opposition&mdash;is not interested in having any laws which would unreasonably intrude upon the privacy of the telephone system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we have received complaints. Law enforcement agencies at both the state and the federal level have received information about computer bulletin boards being used to traffic a range of offensive material&mdash;in some cases criminal material, such as stolen credit card numbers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. Certainly this is a matter that I think many in the community are surprised about and would echo the sentiments of Ms Breen. She is quoted in the press as saying that she was incredibly offended and astounded at the decision that she was not able, as a matter of right, to have access to her personal medical records.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think, plainly, this brings into question the way in which we should deal with a regime for freedom of information and whether freedom of information legislation should be extended to the private sector. That, of course, in the context of this case, is against a background where I do not think anyone would challenge the proposition that medical information would have to be amongst the category of information which you would say to be most personal and most important to know and that any citizen might be concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, against that framework, we have an odd situation where, if people are patients within the public hospital system of any state, they have a right under freedom of information legislation to access their personal files and information about their medical treatment. But, if they are patients within private hospitals or are seeking treatment from private medical practitioners outside the public health system, they have no such right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case in which Ms Breen was the plaintiff and which was decided and determined against her in the Supreme Court of New South Wales is a case, of course, where I make no criticism of the judge involved. He was doing no more than, as Dr Cashman, who acted on her behalf, said, confirming what was understood to be the status quo. Nonetheless, there is now, I think, a very lively public question as to whether that status quo ought to remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that effect, some while ago I announced the establishment of a review of the Freedom of Information Act, which is now 12 years old. The Freedom of Information Act, as you know, now provides an effective regime for any member of the public who has dealings with the government to access their personal files and information. Complementary legislation exists at a state level. The interesting question is whether or not that legislation should also, in the way in which we evolve that legislation, apply to the private sector. The review will consider, particularly in the areas of medical records or banking information and the like, whether such an entitlement ought be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A discussion paper will be published on this very interesting issue towards the end of this week, and we will be looking forward to receiving public submissions. A final report will be published to me and made public at the end of next year. So we have a process that has actually anticipated this problem, is in place already, and will bring to light responses that may enable us to have a different solution to this issue which has obviously bedevilled Ms Breen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there would be anyone in this House who is not insensitive to Ms Breen's circumstance as a woman who had two breast implants which, unfortunately, were not medical successes and who has now found herself in a circumstance where she has been denied access to her medical files other than through subpoenas issued in pursuit of legal proceedings. These are issues that I think are properly the subject of an issue of public inquiry and I look forward in due course to the report of the Law Reform Commission and the Administrative Review Council.</PARA>

Is the government prepared to meet the claims of the families of the victims of that crash resulting from the failure of the CAA to enforce this particular regulation? What will be the actual cost to the government of the claims of the families?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Is the minister aware of Professor Derek Tribe's prediction in his new book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Feeding and greening the world</EMPHASIS>, that the world's population will grow by four billion over the next 40 years, requiring almost a doubling of global food output? I ask: is Australia making any contribution to international research relating to this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only am I aware of Derek Tribe's book, but I launched it at lunchtime today. I think it makes a great contribution to debate on this very important issue. Arguably the most important issue which faces the world is the capacity of the world to keep up the production of food, given the rapidly rising population growth rates and to do so at the same time as minimising the environmental impact of the increasing demands which are being placed on the world's finite resources. It is a huge challenge. I can think of no greater challenge. But it is a challenge that Australia is meeting through its contribution to international agricultural research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has been a consistently strong supporter of international agricultural research. Over the last four years Australia's contribution to aid funding through its program to such research has increased by between 10 and 15 per cent per annum. I do not believe that is true of any other country in the world. Unfortunately, others have not risen to that challenge as well as they might.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research is being undertaken by ACIAR, the Australian Council for International Agricultural Research and the Crawford Fund, established in memory of the late Sir John Crawford. It is also being conducted by international research centres such as the International Rice Research Institute; CIMMYT, the body in Mexico which is concerned with increasing the varieties of maize and wheat available; the newly established international forestry research centre in Indonesia; and one which is particularly close to my heart, ICLARM, the International Centre for Living Aquatic Resources Management headed by Dr Meryl Williams. Dr Williams was formerly the head of AIMS, the Australian Institute of Marine Science. She is a very capable woman in a field which I predict will be ever more important as the land which is available for agriculture becomes more marginal and more difficult to bring into production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A defining feature of our aid program is that we try to use our areas where we have a comparative advantage as components of our aid program, and that goes in spades for international agricultural research. I might also point out&mdash;it is nice that I have the attention of the Leader of the National Party, who was present at the launch of Derek Tribe's book&mdash;that international agricultural research generates benefits in developing countries. As a result of that growth, there are substantial benefits for Australia in having access in direct ways to the technologies which are developed. For example, it is estimated that with the wheat varieties developed by CIMMYT, to which I referred earlier, we get 150 times our annual contribution to that each year in returns to our own wheat farmers. It is a very good example of how, through the aid program, we do well for ourselves by doing good to others. I thank the member, whose interest in aid is well known, for this very timely question.</PARA>

Three of the other members of the OECD which are not placed on that list are higher as well. I could also add, since the shadow Treasurer is constantly chatting to us about New Zealand rates, that New Zealand's rate is 7.9 per cent. The shadow Treasurer always mentions this in the context of mortgage rates. But Australia is not in the position in which he states it is. It is nowhere near the proposition that he puts forward.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This report represents the results of a substantial inquiry involving 56 recommendations in toto and 139 submissions from a variety of sources: state and federal departments, the RSL, a number of members of this House, and various state affiliates of FECCA&mdash;amongst many others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset I will pay tribute to the work of the committee: to the chairman, Senator McKiernan, and to the deputy chairman, Senator Short; the secretary, Andres Lomp; the committee's legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin; the inquiry staff, Mr Stephen Boyd, Ms Dianne Fraser and Mr Peter Tighe; and the committee's parliamentary intern, Ms Rosemary Van Der Meer. I note that Ms Van Der Meer's contribution in regards to an analysis of different situations in countries around the world on the matter of citizenship was a major background material for the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry dealt with a variety of issues. A focus will certainly be on the year 1999&mdash;from the committee's point of view, at least; I hope that the minister will agree&mdash;as the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship. The committee has put forward a variety of propositions that should, in reality, receive emphasis in that year. There should be a year dedicated to Australian citizenship. There should be a national citizenship week to increase national interest in the matter; there should be national awards; and there should be a very broad effort in regards to education on citizenship. We have had submissions during the inquiry from the Constitutional Centenary Foundation, from the Parliamentary Education Office and from many other sources indicating that there can be a major effort in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the crucial issues the committee dealt with was dual citizenship. I must confess that my views on the matter changed in the course of the inquiry. I originally had a view that this issue should not be basically dictated by commercial changes around the world. I was not especially persuaded that a few individuals might not be able to advance their careers within multinational corporations because we did not allow dual citizenship. However, in the course of the inquiry I think that there was substantial evidence for a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation is that section 17 of the Citizenship Act states that persons will lose citizenship if they carry out any act or thing the sole or dominant purpose of which and the effect of which is to renounce Australian citizenship. One of the major reasons committee members came to the conclusion that there had to be change was when they faced the reality of the degree of discrimination this involves&mdash;that if a person takes out our citizenship and the country of their existing citizenship permits it then, in reality, we allow them to have dual citizenship. So in reality we have those people born here for practical purposes being second-class citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of importance. There are now, apparently, in the area of three million Australians&mdash;at least as early as 1986, and they have probably grown since&mdash;who do have citizenship with other countries. This matter has been largely controlled by the Hague convention since after the First World War. It substantially involves a different world, where people were not that able to move around, to change residence, et cetera. It substantially directed itself to the problems that arose from dual citizenship: people being compelled to do military service for their former country of residence or birth, passports being seized by other countries and the problem of enforcing personal injury claims and property claims in another country. Along the road there was a variety of bilateral agreements to try to overcome these various problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as facing up to this clear area of discrimination against part of our population, I think subclause 6.30 drove home another reality when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Europe, there is considerable momentum for change in citizenship law as membership of the European Union prompts countries to re-evaluate their citizenship law.</PARA>
<PARA>What they are getting to is the fact that internationally the majority of countries taking one position or the other is swiftly changing. In the last year or so Italy, the Netherlands and France are among those that have made substantial moves towards dual citizenship. We did not immediately abandon the point that the DIEA made to the inquiry that Australian thought on this matter was largely predicated on `a detraction from the ideals of a single citizenship for all Australians'. It is said that citizenship status should not be treated as a commodity which is sought for purely economic reasons or the convergence of travel arrangements, employment opportunities and tax advantage. Certainly the committee considered those facts but, as stated in paragraph 6.89 of the report, in seeking what `best serves the needs of the contemporary Australian society' it concludes that the current provisions are `outmoded and discriminatory'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also noted importantly in paragraph 6.92 that there is no evidence to suggest that persons who possess dual citizenship&mdash;and there are significant numbers now&mdash;are disloyal or lack a commitment to Australia simply because they have chosen not to relinquish their former ties and heritage. We also considered the administrative burden on embassies and consulates, the nature of Australia as a country changing in recent decades, with a greater emphasis on tolerance and diversity, and, as noted earlier, the question of employment and business opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the committee has recommended that Australia does move towards allowing dual citizenship for all people, not just for those who happen to have been born overseas. That is in line with a trend internationally and a reality that Australia must face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter the committee dealt with was the question of the power of the minister to revoke citizenship. Currently section 21 requires that someone actually be convicted under section 50 of the Citizenship Act in regard to fraudulent conduct leading to the gaining of citizenship if they knowingly made a false or misleading representation or concealed material circumstances when applying for citizenship or, if after applying, they were convicted of a sentence leading to death or 12 months imprisonment or, finally, if it is contrary to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee&mdash;which includes, I should note, a number of people who have substantial involvement and a deep interest in migration matters, not only from the evidence given to the committee but from their own experience in the electorate&mdash;has become concerned that if we allow people basically to obtain permanent residence by fraudulent conduct then that should be tackled; it should not just be a matter of the minister and the government only being able to act where the fraud involves the later event of citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the committee has recommended that it not in future be requisite that an actual conviction be obtained. It will be noted that since 1949 under the current provisions only five people have suffered from the provisions of this act. In my own mind this is a significant opportunity for the government. You get these claims every day of the week in your office, particularly in regard to spouse applications. There are suggestions that the committee does not quite go this far but I think there is a fair ambit there for more action by the government. The views of the committee were summarised in paragraph 4.183:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee rejects this view . . . once persons acquire citizenship, it should be beyond the power of the state to take that citizenship away. . . it is appropriate for the Minister to have the power to revoke . . . if it is discovered that the person obtained the citizenship by deceit or fraud, or if a crime committed . . . is of such magnitude that it would have resulted in the refusal . . . of the application.</PARA>
<PARA>I note in passing that we are not Robinson Crusoe on this suggestion; Canada, New Zealand and the United States have similar provisions. So this is in substance saying that the actual stage of seeking permanent residence can be reviewed towards revocation of citizenship and that the conviction itself should not be necessary. At the same time the committee reiterated a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other matters. Recommendation 50 concerns the attendance of officers of the Australian Electoral Office at citizenship functions. We have had claims that this has been basically abandoned because there is too much overtime involved in the process, some of these ceremonies being on weekends and at night. The committee had a view that it is far more important that people who have become citizens of this country have the opportunity to exercise their right to be on the electoral rolls of this country and to vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was produced that the current process where people can apply for enrolment at the same time they apply for citizenship is being undermined by the inaction and negligence of a number of councils around Australia taking up to five months to notify the Australian Electoral office that particular individuals have become citizens of Australia. An instance was given where in a few days in Queensland thousands of people had to be notified within a week, from recollection, to get on the rolls because of this failure. So what we are effectively saying is that we would like to see the rights of these individuals and their opportunity to participate have a bit more weight than a bit more overtime in the AEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we know from a variety of television documentaries the plight of the British child migrants who were brought to Australia after 1945. There have been estimates that there are as many as 10,000. Whilst their representatives have put forward a view that they should automatically be given citizenship, the committee did not agree with that aspect, noting that some individuals might not particularly want to become citizens. I think we should note that a very high proportion of British have not chosen to take up this option anyway. Equally, some people might thereby receive citizenship who on other grounds are unqualified. As I say, we did not agree with that, but the committee has recommended that their charges be waived in regard to applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the defence forces, there is currently a concession in regard to the requirements of residence. The committee has recommended that that be extended to the people in the reserves who have served full time for three months. Another matter is the question of the standard of English required of successful citizenship applicants. Currently, for some unknown reason, there is a distinction between those people who have to have a requirement of English and those who have to have a knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. In the latter case, the minister can waive the discretion if people are over 65 years of age; in the former case, when people are as young as 50 years of age. The committee has recommended that in future the limit should be set at 60 years of age for all people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, there are a variety of recommendations in relation to citizenship applications, such as residence revocation. As well as that, the committee very strongly indicates that it would like to see a greater priority put by the government and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs on the importance of citizenship. It has advocated that moneys be devoted to local government authorities to ensure that citizenship ceremonies are improved and that we attempt to get some indications of best practice. I think that all politicians know from their experience in going to these ceremonies that, even within a kilometre, two different councils can have very diverse practices. Some of these ceremonies really do not do much to inspire the new citizen as to the importance of the function. As I say, in this report there is advocacy of more oversight by the department, more interest by the department and more liaison with the local government authorities to try to bring in standards and to actually get a minimum list of requirements in regard to issues such as who can attend ceremonies and who can speak at them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as I said earlier, there is the question of trying to increase education in this area. I think we all know that in the school system there can be some controversy about the nature of what is taught, and there is the possibility of some bipartisanship in the way the matter could be put. But, fundamentally, the committee worked very well to reach an agreement that the government should beef up its act in this area as well. I commend the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I believe that the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians all, enhancing Australian citizenship</EMPHASIS>, which has been prepared by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, will make a contribution towards the greater recognition of the meaning of citizenship. In this day and age, many seek citizenship not for what they can do for the country but, to adapt that phrase of Kennedy, for what the country and, in particular, citizenship can do for them. Some see citizenship more as a vehicle to attain privileged access into Australia than as a means of contributing towards the good government and proper wellbeing of the citizenry as a whole. Many people do not see the responsibilities that flow from citizenship&mdash;be it in terms of voting or participation in the civil service, the army or in other areas where citizenship is a prerequisite&mdash;as being particularly consequential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has really set down what we see as the minimal parameters which need to be addressed by the government to enhance the value of citizenship itself. Commendation should go to the chairman and the members of the committee, but credit must also go to, in particular, the secretary of the committee, Andres Lomp, our legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin, Mr Stephen Boyd and others who have helped us, including the secretariat. They really have done a great deal of the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want first to say, however, that my concerns in the reference began with a comment by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus). As noted in chapter one of the report, the minister advised the committee that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government considers that the core criteria in relation to acquisition of citizenship by birth (s10 of the Act) and descent (ss10B, 10C and 11 of the Act), and the core criteria in relation to grant of citizenship (s13(1) of the Act) and the new pledge, are appropriate and not in the significant amendment.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were matters, therefore, that were not dealt with by the report. I must admit that, as the report notes, only limited evidence on the criteria for the grant of citizenship was received and that evidence did not allow for detailed investigation. I am not one who believes that the present processes of the granting of citizenship, the pledge and the general surrounds in the conferring of citizenship are adequate. I think it is important that, along with the enhanced status that this committee report suggests, there be an opportunity for people to understand the virtue and merit of having an enhanced stature beyond that which I believe is given at that moment. I do not think that the present oath or pledge is sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, as one who feels quite strongly about proper process, I do not think that the pledge deals in proper process. Whatever might happen in the future, I think it is important that we recognise the constitution as it is and our rights and responsibilities within that constitution. I very much regret and, indeed, condemn those who have changed that process in what I see as a means rather to pursue political objectives than to make citizenship worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), whose speech preceded mine, said many of the things that I think need to be identified within the content of the report, but a few matters are worth commenting on. Prior to the close of his remarks, the honourable member referred to the extent the differing ages attract a dispensation for those who lack knowledge of the English language and those who do not have an understanding of the rights, responsibilities and privileges of citizenship. To my mind, in order to justify their being able to meet their obligations as citizens, it is necessary that people know a sufficient amount of English. I am pleased to see that that is retained because I believe it is very important that there be an understanding of the way in which the nature of our society is essentially preserved around the basis of our all being able to communicate with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is reason for those who come by virtue of a program of family reunion after they have perhaps reached the age of 60 to have that requirement dispensed with, but I do not believe that that should pertain to younger people. If we are going to retain the capacity that has really given Australia a unique characteristic, a lingua franca is absolutely essential, for that relates very much to what citizenship is all about. To those who perhaps have not thought about the meaning of citizenship&mdash;whether it relates to being naturally born or naturalised by the pledge or oath that is a requirement of the conferring ceremony&mdash;I commend the reading of chapter 2 of the report, which begins on page 9. It describes something of the background of the status other civilisations once attributed to the term `citizenship'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept derives from the classical Greek and Roman worlds. They were entirely different from ours, yet in those societies it was important that people understood that citizens were, as Aristotle described them, `all who share in the civic life of ruling and being ruled in turn'; in other words, people who receive a unique responsibility in society. We have tried to identify the fact that citizenship is not just a vehicle to attain a passport; it is far more than that. Given the background of this issue, the fact that only recently has the concept of citizenship been revived and the fact that, in a society like ours, so many come from other communities to adapt to our way of life, it is even more important that these people should have a capacity to recognise the virtues and values of being Australian. For those of us who were born here, it is equally important that we too, as citizens, should not just take for granted the opportunities, the privileges and the rights that flow from that status being conferred on us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee report has accordingly made a number of recommendations with respect to enhancing the stature of citizenship. As the honourable gentleman who preceded me, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), suggested, the conferring ceremony is one which often leads to a financial burden on councils. The differences between local government bodies is often quite distinct, so we have suggested that there be a review of the core criteria for the granting of citizenship and that there be a profile developed aimed at trying to ensure some idea of the rights and responsibilities that flow. We have also suggested that we should try to help local government financially to ensure that the citizenship ceremony is one which ensures that the people who acquire citizenship are given public acclaim and that the ceremony itself allows for public recognition of the importance of the decision being taken by those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have looked at the extent to which there can be a revocation of citizenship. It is proper that there should be that opportunity to revoke citizenship where persons knowingly commit fraud in relation to their citizenship applications and also where such fraud is committed in order to obtain permanent residence in Australia. Again, that is part of giving to citizenship the proper stature and status that should flow through to it. It is important that there is a recognition that if citizenship is acquired by fraud in any way there should be no permanency about the citizenship so given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that, where citizenship interviews are being conducted by postal officers, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs ensure that those officers are of appropriate seniority&mdash;that is, postal managers&mdash;and that they are trained adequately in requirements for the granting of citizenship and the process for interviewing citizenship applicants. I do not think the matter of citizenship should in any way be dealt with at any stage of the process in a perfunctory fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the recommendations that the government, I trust, will pick up&mdash;it is certainly one that I strongly endorse&mdash;is that Australian passports incorporate a statement that the bearer of the passport is an Australian citizen. I believe that to be a matter of some significance. It is one that I think is important in the context of trying to identify the fact that a person is an Australian citizen. It is something that should apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the most important part of the recommendations of the committee in a political sense is that relating to dual citizenship. This is a matter on which numbers of us have been engaged in a soul-searching process over the years. There is no doubt that a number of fairly prominent former Australians no longer enjoy Australian citizenship because they have sought the citizenship of another country and in so doing have relinquished the citizenship of their country of origin. I do not like the idea of a person being able to give equal allegiance to two societies&mdash;at heart, I confess that I would prefer that there be only one citizenship&mdash;but I recognise the reality that many in this country who now hold Australian citizenship are bound by their country of origin to a system where they have dual citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the rather strange situation of having citizens from many countries who regard the fact that they also have Australian citizenship as irrelevant and they retain their other allegiance. As has been mentioned, the whole problem is complicated by the extent to which so many Australians are in the position of having originally had British citizenship and being British subjects, or being Irish citizens and being British subjects or coming from New Zealand. They are in a different position. It is that group of people who, obviously, have found it difficult in recent times to accept that Australian citizenship now is a prerequisite in many ways. They have not acquired that citizenship and that is to be regretted. I think they, too, have British passports and many still travel on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have sought to recognise some of those anomalies. Hence we have recommended that Australian citizens in future be allowed to acquire dual citizenship. That will mean that any former Australian citizen who has lost Australian citizenship will have the unqualified right to apply for the resumption of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other aspects of the report which are commendable. It is a report which does help to enhance the nature and character of Australian citizenship. It is a report which should help the public understand&mdash;the native born, those who seek to acquire Australian citizenship and those who have been resident here for many years without acquiring Australian citizenship&mdash;that there is an important role they can play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that my colleague the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has arrived it is possible for me to conclude. I know that he, too, wishes to comment on the report to which he has contributed a great deal. It is a very important report. It is one which I commend in its entirety to the government. I believe and trust that the government will accept each of the recommendations in full. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This matter is of particular interest to me. The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, interestingly enough, refers to the way in which this particular inquiry was initiated. The view that was formed by the government when it looked at the issue of the oath and affirmation of allegiance particularly was that there ought to be a wider debate on citizenship and the need for a fundamental review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first called for a fundamental review of citizenship in 1992. In this context the report is a response to the political dimension that citizenship had largely lost its importance. It was seen in a context of people being able to obtain certain immediate benefits but not necessarily in terms of the wider issues of obligations. As a result of the view that had been formed that we have a constitution that sets out certain basic structural arrangements for government in Australia and certain rights that people achieve, we have certain legislation that sets out people's rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national agenda for a multicultural Australia developed views about the extent to which people ought to have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, its interests and future, the acceptance of the basic structures and principles of our society, and a recognition that citizenship imposes obligations as well as confers rights. The right to express one's own culture and belief involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the rights of others to express their views and values and, within carefully defined limits, to have the right to express their individual cultural heritage. All Australians have the right to equality of treatment and opportunity and the removal of the barriers of race, ethnicity, culture, religion, language, gender and place of birth as well as the opportunity to maintain, develop and utilise effectively skills and talents that all Australians have regardless of background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These elements of the national agenda for a multicultural Australia, which I have just summed up, seem to me to embody what it is to be Australian. This report talks about citizenship in the modern world, enhancing Australian citizenship and the adjustment to Australian citizenship law in order to have a better understanding of a number of issues that relate to how you acquire and can possibly lose and reacquire citizenship. The report deals with a number of matters of that sort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the terms of reference, the committee has not addressed a number of issues relating to the length of time people must be here before they obtain citizenship. It has not addressed the issue of the requirements of English language competency. The committee recognises that there ought to be a reconsideration of these issues, but because the government had determined in its terms of reference that they should not be the subject of review in this report the committee simply flagged that these are matters that do need further reconsideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have dealt with issues relating to citizenship processing and passports. I do not want to spend a great deal of time on any of that, except to say that there are important recommendations about the way in which citizenship ceremonies are conducted and the responsibilities of local authorities which confer citizenship by delegation. Some local authorities see in those citizenship ceremonies almost a personal fiefdom, a proprietorial ownership, which enables them to decide who shall be able to come and not come and who should be able to speak. We have offered some views on that which I think are helpful to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I want to draw people's attention to is dual citizenship. I think it is the first time, since the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee looked at the matter almost a decade ago, that this has been the subject of a comprehensive review. As an Australian, I, like many others, would like to think that Australian citizenship was something that you held and did not give away lightly&mdash;something that was meaningful&mdash;but we have a situation where a very large proportion of our community is now dual nationals. That dual nationality cannot be taken away from them. The determination of dual nationality arises because, after they have become Australian citizens, another country says, `We will not relinquish their right to be citizens of our country.' There is a framework of international law where, for instance, a citizen of the United States migrates to Australia and takes out Australian citizenship but does not lose United States citizenship. The report outlines the practice on that. That situation applies to many other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If distinguished Australians such as Rupert Murdoch go overseas and take out American citizenship, under our law they forfeit that citizenship. I am not in the business of defending Rupert Murdoch or his business interests, but I looked at a number of submissions that we received from individuals, one of which was from a lady that I know very well who is living with her children in France. She sets out not only her emotional attachment to Australia but also why it may be necessary for her and her family to take out French citizenship. The consequences for her and her children as Australians if they have to do that are&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite dramatic. I ask myself: why do we put the onus on our citizens to have to weigh up those matters so closely? It may be that it is necessary for her to enrol her kids in school in France, where she happens to be for business purposes. There might be a whole range of reasons for them to take out French citizenship, yet there is a forfeiture of this longstanding connection with Australia. In her case, her family had been Australians for three or four generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, if we go through the previous reviews of dual nationality, we find that the arguments were predicated upon a fear that many Australians from places like the Baltic states, Greece and other European countries thought there was a potential for conscription if they remained citizens of those countries or a concern that a totalitarian regime may have some continuing hold on them. That prompted people to say, `If they have dual nationality in Australia, that might compromise them in some way if they were travelling internationally.' So the foreign affairs, defence and trade committee developed this very narrow view based on representations of a particular character at the time. I think it has to be seen that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The weight of evidence in this inquiry was overwhelmingly in favour of changing the law of dual citizenship: that is, Australians going offshore taking out citizenship of another country should not automatically forfeit their Australian citizenship. Honourable members will probably gather from this discussion that I came to a view on this matter in the context of this report that one ought to speak through the committee report to the government and say, `We have reached a time when the issue of dual citizenship can be addressed again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 17 of the Citizenship Act, which requires people to give up their citizenship, is something that can be amended. I see this part of the report as being the most important. It recommends a fundamental change in approach, but I want the government to know that a bipartisan approach was adopted on this matter. I think it is an area in which the government ought to move quickly. It will be doing so in an environment in which Australians generally will welcome such a change. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill establishes and protects a basic right for all Australians: the right of consenting adults to privacy in their own bedroom. Much of the public debate and the debate in this chamber has been set in terms of states rights versus human rights. The truth is that governments do not have rights; only citizens have rights. Indeed, it is the role of governments&mdash;federal and state&mdash;to defend basic rights such as the right to privacy. Legislation such as this is a very important contribution to the rights of Australian citizens. It also says a lot about Australia's emerging maturity as a nation. I made mention of this prior to question time. It reflects on the way in which political issues are being determined in this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has always been an egalitarian society in its values and mannerisms, but old Australia expressed this by locking out people and ideas, straightening out change and living in fear of its isolation and the tyranny of distance. Australia in the 1990s is a very different society. It is expressing its egalitarianism in a different way, through values of tolerance and acceptance. We are now a much more inclusive society, willing to take its place in the world&mdash;not so much frightened by distance and isolation but willing to break down the barriers to Australia's place in the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has occurred in migration policies, such as the abolition of White Australia. It has also happened through the internationalisation of the Australian economy. We should be very willing, as a parliament and as Australians, to take our place in international treaties for the protection of basic international and national rights. As Manning Clark said, the time has come for the enlargers to determine Australia's direction. That is very much the direction of the Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Labor Party now stands as Australia's only national party, placing national responsibilities and values ahead of parochialism and the politics of isolationism and fear of distance. The Liberal and National parties are an unholy alliance of state interests, a strange mixture of liberal and conservative values. This is a party and a coalition of shellbacks and throwbacks to old Australia, an Australia now past. The snarly honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) can object, but it comes out time and time again in the seams of coalition policy, such as that displayed by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in relation to a monocultural society, a throwback to White Australia and fear of Asian migration. It comes out in the obsession of the opposition with the monarchy&mdash;trying to use the British crown as a security blanket for the insecurities of people in the coalition and fellow travellers like Joan Sutherland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unholy alliance comes out in the National Party and its lingering attachment to industry protectionism, a policy that was ditched a decade ago. It has come out in the statements of the Leader of the Opposition; the ambivalence he strings out about foreign investment and international treaties. It is also a feature of coalition policy on states rights, of the attitude taken by so many coalition members to this legislation and the denial of land rights to Aboriginal people in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has presented a compromise on this legislation that again reflects its attachment to old Australia&mdash;fear of distance and fear of isolation. It is saying it does not support this bill, but it will not oppose it. That is, the coalition does not support the basic privacy and human rights of Australians; it just will not oppose them. The National Party organisation has actively encouraged its members of parliament to oppose the bill and vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be on this side of the parliament supporting this bill, part of the government's approach of achieving an outward-looking tolerant egalitarian Australian society, not throwing back to the days when Australia was insecure and frightened of its place in the world, days when we relied on White Australia policies to lock migrants out of Australia, relied on industry protection and relied on the British crown&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party has moved past those things, and you have not. That is the point of this debate. The ALP has moved itself into the 1990s while the coalition is still locked back in the 1950s kowtowing to Menzies and his cabinet. The coalition has not updated its policies and has not got a decent understanding of the way in which Australian values have evolved through the 1980s and 1990s. That is why the coalition is in such an abysmal mess on a basic issue like this&mdash;a basic issue of human rights; the right to privacy for all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some coalition members support the bill, others oppose it, others are going for a long walk around Canberra to abstain on the vote and the member for Berowra is moving an amendment&mdash;four positions within the one coalition, and you are trying to tell me the coalition has updated its policy. It has not. It is back in the 1950s and that is reflected in the way in which its members are presenting themselves and their voting intention on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline of states rights is one of the most important developments in Australian politics in the 1990s. The states rights defence is based on a view of an Australian federation in which the rights of state governments take priority over the rights of citizens and the national parliament. This is a throwback to the insecurity of the colonies last century. This doctrine was buried in the engineers case in 1920 in which the High Court of Australia ruled that federal constitutional powers should be allowed to operate without artificial restrictions. This judgment was confirmed in the uniform tax cases in 1942 and 1957. The idea of states sovereignty in Australia is now a moribund and archaic concept, if in fact it ever existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to Federation in 1901 the only source of sovereign power in Australia was the British crown. The colonies accepted that and indeed many of those opposite&mdash;the colonists and the monarchists of the Liberal Party and the National Party&mdash;probably wish it were still the case. But the truth is Australia has moved on. It cannot be argued in logic that the colonies gained any greater sovereignty through the act of federation. In fact the colonies sought a national framework in which to defend their own interests and explicitly approved of the federal parliament taking responsibility for the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Australian constitution was drafted section 51(xxix), on the external affairs power, was left intentionally weak not to protect or enhance the sovereignty of the states but to preserve the sovereignty of the British crown. For 20 years after Federation, Britain conducted most of Australia's external affairs. Through the Imperial Conferences of the 1920s, however, Britain withdrew from these arrangements thus enhancing the sovereignty of the national parliament but leaving the position of the states and the rights of the states unchanged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the decades since, the sovereignty and responsibilities of this parliament have been further confirmed. The High Court has continued to place national responsibilities and states rights in their proper perspective. In 1985 the chief justice of Australia, Sir Anthony Mason, told an audience at the University of Virginia that proponents of states rights `tend to assume, quite wrongly, that the constitution preserves in some way or other the actual balance of powers, or the actual federal-state relationship as it existed at some undefined time shortly after the constitution came into operation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 Justices Mason, Brennan and Deane wrote in a joint judgment&mdash;and members opposite might care to listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Constitution contemplates that the States will be subject to control or regulation by the Commonwealth or its agencies in particular respects, their subjection to that control or regulation cannot amount to a relevant impairment or inhibition on their capacity to govern.</PARA>
<PARA>That makes the point that states rights are subordinate to the rights of the national parliament&mdash;set out in the Australian constitution, interpreted and decided upon in judgments since 1920 by the High Court of Australia. The High Court, to its credit, has interpreted our constitution to mean that human rights are more important than states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has an important role to play in fulfilling its international responsibilities. In discharging those responsibilities it has been left to the federal parliament and the federal government to be party to international treaties. You only need to look to the views of Garfield Barwick, not someone known to take an enlightened view on these matters. In 1975, as the chief justice in the Seas and Submerged Lands case, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only the Commonwealth has international status. The colonies never were and the States are not international persons.</PARA>
<PARA>Only this national parliament can discharge Australia's international responsibilities. Until recent times there was bipartisan support in Australian politics for the fulfilment of these responsibilities through international treaties. Australia is currently party to approximately 920 treaties, about the OECD average and well less than the 7,000 in force in the United States. Treaties have enormous benefits to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Parkes scoffs at that notion. He might like to consider that the package of multilateral agreements included as part of the Uruguay Round will increase Australia's exports by around $5 billion and our GDP by $4.4 billion by the year 2002. A lot of those exports and a lot of that growth will come out of your electorate, from the primary producers you seek to represent. So do not regard these international treaties as being restricted to the rights of privacy or human rights; they relate to international economic relations and have a host of benefits for the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With advances in communications, transport and trade Australia must accept its role in the international community. A constructive role relies on international cooperation through international treaties. The whole thrust of our national policy is to integrate Australia's economy and our social fabric with the international community. We are building the model of a successful outward-looking trading nation with all the virtues of a dynamic multicultural and tolerant society. That is the government's position. The opposition is always edging us back towards White Australia, towards industry protection, towards this inward looking focus on international investment, on international treaties, and on the monarchy and relying on Britain to give Australia a sense of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only the Labor Party that is bringing Australia through with the values relevant to the 1990s. Those values are reflected in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was signed by the Whitlam government and ratified by the Fraser government on 13 August 1980. Members opposite might like to consider the joint press release issued by the then Fraser foreign minister, Andrew Peacock, and the Attorney-General, Peter Durack, when they stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ratification of the convention was important not only for the benefits it would confer on the Australian people, but also because it promotes a firm basis of principle which Australia would apply in considering international human rights questions.</PARA>
<PARA>The convention is the basis of the legislation now before the parliament. It was signed by the Whitlam government, ratified by the Fraser government and acted on by the Keating government, the bipartisanship having been destroyed by the Downer opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is set fairly in the great traditions of liberal democracy&mdash;that is, the liberating role of government to provide and guarantee basic human rights and freedoms. No human right is more important than the right to privacy. This legislation shows that Australia takes seriously its national and international responsibilities for civil and political rights. It is a significant part of Australia's emerging maturity&mdash;no longer an isolated and inward looking country but a nation confident enough to open its economy and society to the world and tolerant enough to protect the basic rights of its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation says that human rights are more important than states rights. It says that governments do not have rights, only citizens do. It says that governments have no role in the bedrooms of Australians, regulating aspects of sexual behaviour and choice among consenting adults. It is a bill that demands and deserves the support of all fair-minded Australians and each of the members assembled in this House of Representatives. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The previous speaker, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), accused us of certain things. However, I think he is living in the past and parading his old prejudices before us today. We are debating the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which is probably the shortest bill ever to come before the parliament. It is one paragraph long, four lines; indeed, the substance of the bill is only one sentence long. But rarely has so much been written about so little in the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me are the reasons why the government has brought this bill into the House. I think the reasons are typical of the way that this government acts. This government is not bringing this bill in because it passionately believes in it. It is bringing it in so that more power may be centralised in Canberra. It is bringing it in to garner the homosexual vote. It is bringing it in to have a shot at the Tasmanian Liberal government and to score a cheap political point. It is bringing it in in an attempt to cause mischief amongst the federal coalition, and it is bringing it in to provide a diversion from the troubles that exist in this country today. That particularly distresses me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the situation today where Australia is suffering a record current account deficit, in excess of $2,000 million a month. We have a record overseas debt created by this government. We have new record high real interest rates and interest rates rising at this very moment. In this country we have 850,000 jobless, record high youth unemployment, record high youth suicide, near record bankruptcy and drought crunching the life out of rural Australia. Ninety per cent of the state I come from is declared drought stricken. People are trying to get wheat into the country. It is $27 a tonne to bring it across the Pacific from America and Canada, and it is $40 a tonne to bring it from Perth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues have been neglected for months while the government has been working on this bill. I think that the government has its priorities skewed. As soon as this bill is out of the road, the government will then be continuing its work, which it has been at for two years, on the racial vilification bill. When we see these sorts of priorities being set by the government, it is hard not to be cynical about its motives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what this bill does. The one four-line sentence I referred to earlier states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, I think that means, in layman's language, that the police cannot burst into your bedroom and check what you are doing in there. By itself, that is an unremarkable statement. I do not think there is anyone who would object to that by itself. It is uncontroversial; it is almost banal in intent. It is when we go a little further and consider the effect of the bill that we have some disquiet about it. In effect, the bill sets out to nullify chapter 14 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 of Tasmania and, in particular, sections 122 and 123. I will read out the relevant parts of those sections. Section 122 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any person who . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">has sexual intercourse with any person against the order of nature</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">or . . . consents to a male person having sexual intercourse with him or her against the order of nature,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">is guilty of a crime.</PARA>
<PARA>That person will be charged with unnatural sexual intercourse. As the Attorney-General of Tasmania, Ronald Cornish, says in a letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 122 of the Criminal Code refers to sodomy. You will note that this section does not discriminate against people, only against conduct, hence this section applies equally to both heterosexual and homosexual couples.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 123 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any male person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it excludes females&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who, whether in public or private, commits any indecent assault upon, or other act of gross indecency with, another male person, or procures another male person to commit any act of gross indecency with himself or any other male person, is guilty of a crime&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that person will be charged with indecent practice between male persons. The Attorney-General, Ronald Cornish, then says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 123 of the Criminal Code contains a prohibition against indecent assaults or other acts of gross indecency committed between male persons. You will note that this section is directed towards conduct by male persons only.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the Tasmanian Criminal Code Act was enacted in 1924. If it were enforced&mdash;in other words, if someone were arrested in their bedroom&mdash;once this bill that we are debating here today becomes law, an appeal could be made to the High Court and we would then have a conflict, with a Commonwealth law saying one thing and a state law saying something else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, under normal circumstances, the Commonwealth parliament has no direct power to legislate in relation to privacy. To support the legislation, the Commonwealth relies on bringing this bill before the House by tapping into its external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. That is something that we on this side do not think should be automatically done in the way the government has been doing with increasing frequency in recent years. Of course, once you have a federal law up against a state law, the federal law applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do note that this bill says that there will be no interference whatsoever with minors&mdash;that is, people under 18 years of age; there will be no interference whatsoever with people who are conducting these acts of sodomy, or whatever else they are doing, by force; and there will be no interference with the Tasmanian government if it wants to come down on people who may be conducting these acts in public. In other words, to be doing something legal under this federal bill, you must be over the age of 18, your partner must consent to what you are doing and you must be doing it in private. That, as it stands, is not something that any reasonable person could object to in any way whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for the coalition there are two principles involved in this bill&mdash;probably for the Labor Party there is only one. The two principles are those of privacy and states rights. Dealing with them in turn, the principle of privacy is a very strong one indeed. This principle says that it is the right of two consenting adults to do whatever they want to do in the privacy of their own home. I think in many senses that is inviolate. On the other hand, we have the principle of states rights, by which the federal government, using the external affairs powers, overrides state laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the states should have the right to make laws for themselves in areas where they have jurisdiction. Privacy is one area where they do have jurisdiction. We believe that the state government will rise or fall at the next state election according to what the people in that state decide for themselves. If the federal government wanted to have that changed, wanted to have the constitution changed, it should put it to the Australian people by way of referendum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, states rights is not a principle that the Labor Party seems to hold at all dear. It treats it with contempt, and I accept its stance on that. The coalition holds both these principles very dearly indeed. Therefore, when a piece of legislation like this comes before us, it is very difficult for us to decide which way to go: if we vote for the principle of privacy, we will violate the principle of states rights, which we hold dear; if we vote the other way, we will violate the other principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are caught, in a sense, on the horns of a dilemma; we have to work this out ourselves, and we have done so. There is a range of opinion on this side of the House as to what we should do with the bill, from those who believe we should support it to those who believe we should oppose it. We have arrived at a position. We are genuinely torn between both principles; I, for one, am genuinely torn between both principles and in a minute I will come to how I have resolved the dilemma. I do not believe, in adopting the coalition's position not to oppose this bill, that the constitution was ever meant to be abused in the way in which the government is abusing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian law has been in place since 1924&mdash;a period of 70 years. I do not know how many state parliaments have been in existence in that period&mdash;probably in the order of a couple of dozen or so. If the truth be known, most of those have probably been Labor Party parliaments. Since 1924, the elected representatives of Tasmania&mdash;whether they be Liberal members or Labor members&mdash;have not seen fit, until this time, to talk about changing that law. If the people of Tasmania feel strongly about it at the next election they will have their chance to exercise their rights at the ballot box, seeing that this issue is now so prominent in the public debating arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has had to decide one way or the other; it has decided not to oppose the bill. I believe in this instance that the principle of privacy outweighs the principle of state rights. I do so with some reluctance because, as I have said, in supporting one principle I am forced to violate another. Therefore, I think it is inappropriate that legislation be brought before us which puts us in this position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made this decision for a number of reasons. One of those reasons relates to the effect this bill will have in Tasmania. In practice, in many ways, this bill will have a nil or negligible effect in Tasmania. You might ask: why do I say that? I say that because, to my knowledge, since 1924 the Tasmanian authorities have never arrested anyone in their bedrooms doing whatever they want to do in their bedrooms. Despite that, everybody&mdash;including the present Liberal government in Tasmania&mdash;knows that homosexual acts are occurring in the homes of Tasmanians every night. I do not know what the number would be; it could be in the order of 10,000 or 15,000. Homosexual acts have probably been going on since the time of convict settlement in Tasmania. They are going on in every state of Australia and in every country in the world. The government knows this, everybody knows this, and the government has chosen to do nothing about it. If this bill comes into effect, I do not think it is vital to what the Tasmanian government wants to do; it does not desperately need this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a philosophical reason for not opposing this bill. I am basically a libertarian; I believe that people should be able to do whatever they want, provided it does not impinge on other people's rights. I transgress from that belief in a number of instances. For example, I believe in the compulsory wearing of seat belts. In this case, people should not have a choice because I think the wearing of seat belts saves many lives. Philosophically, I think the rights of privacy in this case override the state's rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw Manoly Lascaris being interviewed the other day on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. He was the partner of Patrick White for something like 47 years. He was a quite charming gentleman who gave a very honest and revealing interview of the years that he spent as the male friend of Patrick White. In no sense, shape or form would anyone want to have a bill which allowed the police to burst into the bedroom and arrest those people for whatever they may have done over that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not enamoured of acts of homosexuality in any shape or form. I have opposed special grants being given by the federal government for the mardi gras. I have opposed the government granting a special category for homosexual immigration into this country. I have tried to put the AIDS debate on a proper scientific level rather than have it hijacked by the homosexual lobby. Nevertheless, even though I do not approve of what homosexuals do, I respect their rights as human beings to do what they do in privacy. That is just one of the principles by which I abide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also decided not to oppose this bill, if you like, for political and pragmatic reasons. The government has brought this bill before us for mischievous reasons. From the coalition's point of view, it is in our interests politically to sort of ho-hum the bill, let it go through to the keeper, and not have the journalists poised with their pens ready to write when we break asunder and cross the floor and do all these other things. We should get rid of this bill and concentrate on the main issues that I spoke of earlier&mdash;the drought, the level of debt, the interest rates and things like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say a few words about the hypocrisy of the government, which has railed long and loud in this debate about this Tasmanian act. I looked up who brought in the bill in 1924. The first reading was in February, the second reading being later that month. The Attorney-General of the day was Albert Ogilvie and the Premier was Joseph Lyons, of the Labor Party. It was the Labor Party that brought in this bill in 1924. </PARA>

You do not want to know because it is none of your business. That is precisely what is in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can I reflect for a moment on the embarrassment that would be attributed to my wife if I did describe in vivid detail her undergarments and the acts we engage in in our loving relationship. Is she entitled to that privacy? Is she entitled to know that the actions which take place between her and me are our own property, our own intimate details, which are not to be discussed in parking lots, pubs or parliaments? That, in essence, is the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some reason certain people say that they should be able to determine the conduct that takes place in that intimate, consenting, private adult relationship. From my Christian education, I was taught not to put myself up as judge of others. That was expressed to me as one of the central themes of Christianity. It is not for me to stand in judgment. The central theme of Christianity is that there is someone else who will judge. I ask those Christians who sit in this place with me to reflect on that. If they do not believe that, they should vote accordingly. If they do believe that, again, they should vote accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not speak long in this debate because I do not think a lot needs to be said. We need to understand that human rights are in fact that: rights bestowed on people because of their humanity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I ask members to look into their own hearts and souls, while I ask that they consider the tenets of Christianity, while I ask that they think about their comments to my opening remarks in this speech, I also suggest that they take note of the logic behind their thoughts. Members did not want to know what my wife and I do sexually. The member for Mackellar said that members do not want to know, or words to that effect. Quite rightly so. That is probably the first and only time that I will agree with that member. I would suggest that it would have been inappropriate for me to give that description in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament, or any other parliament, is not the place where those things should be canvassed. When the members who agree with the Tasmanian legislation stand up in this place and describe their own sexual acts in explicit detail they will then have the right to make comments about others. Until they are prepared to stand up in here and explain in explicit detail what they do with their genitalia to people that they love, or do not love, or to people they pay for or whatever, in the Christian ethic they should not stand in judgment on others.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the very important Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I want to turn to the origins of this legislation because I think it is very important for the House to understand just how this bill came about. I will firstly pick up what the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) said about the corresponding legislation in the Tasmanian parliament. This legislation was brought in by the Tasmanian Labor Party in 1924. Legislation has an educative role for people growing up and society generally. It is important that people understand some of the concepts of how we run our society. The legislation has been used in an educative way in Tasmania to illustrate the values and concepts that are important for a society and it will continue to be used in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation in Tasmania is in a sense benign. It adds to the window-dressing of the government in this place. I will refer to that again later. Former Senator Peter Walsh, a recently departed Labor minister, said as recently as the end of August in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the government is `bunging on an act for show'. That is exactly what this is all about. The government is putting on an act because in actual fact there is no invasion of privacy in Tasmania. It is putting on a show and it does not mean a lot. The government is window-dressing. This legislation is designed for political purposes and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the origins of this legislation. In May this year the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said that the government would repeal or override sections 122 and 123 of Tasmania's criminal code. The Keating Labor government was going to intervene in Tasmania and override these sections of the law. It was going to ride roughshod over Tasmania. It set  up the scenario that it could walk over any state's criminal code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there was a campaign mounted in Tasmania, and no doubt the government did some legal homework after looking into the matter. It found that it was not able to override any state laws by bringing in legislation in this manner. It could not override the criminal code. If it did, it knew a High Court challenge would most likely be successful. The other fact is that the government holds four seats in Tasmania and it saw the tide running heavily against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had to find a way to placate the people whom it had purported to support. The government had to do a U-turn. The government was going to introduce the legislation in July this year and we were waiting for it. When the government looked into it it found that there were still problems with it. It was trying to decide how to legislate in regard to privacy. Privacy, as we have heard, is within the province of state governments and has been for a long time in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said, `What we have to do is to find an international treaty, an international convention, which will allow us to override the states.' This is probably about the seventh or eighth time in the last eight years that the government has found another avenue to evade the original intentions of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point is that this is Labor legislation. It was dreamt up by the Labor Party; it was designed by the Labor Party; and it was brought into the parliament by the Labor Party. It is not the type of legislation that the coalition would be interested in bringing in. The Labor Party had to bring in some legislation because it was pressured by people out there to do something about the Tasmanian laws. But the Labor Party had to do a U-turn from its original intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an article by former Senator Peter Walsh in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 30 August stated, this is `bunging on an act for a show'. This legislation has no real substance, but is that not typical of the Keating government? Yesterday and today we saw this interaction between the former Prime Minister and the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). That categorises the nature of this government: it is a government of deceit, and this was demonstrated today and yesterday. The government is not interested in spending the time of this parliament on important legislation; rather it is interested in trying to find a hook on which it can create mischief. That is the essence of this legislation, and former Senator Peter Walsh says exactly that in the newspaper article to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for schools and vocational education and training, I was very interested that the government had been alerted to the fact that it was in contravention of an international agreement. I also discovered that 18 months ago the government had been advised on children's rights. The government had been advised by the United Nations committee that, due to its commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it did not meet the international obligations with respect to school discipline. For 18 months the government has been asked to do something about this. I would suggest to the government that it is highly hypocritical for it to act on the recommendations of the United Nations committee with respect to Tasmania's laws, yet refuse to act on the decision of two United Nations committees on physical or mental violence in schools and homes. Why does the government pick out one international obligation but fail to address the others? It is an act; it is a show; it is window-dressing. Other people would say that it is purely a stunt, and it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origins of this legislation come from the Toonen case, which was taken to the UN committee a year or so ago. This came about because of the signing of the first optional protocol which, just to let everyone know, was ratified on Christmas Day 1991. It was slipped through in the quiet period of the year&mdash;ratified on Christmas Day 1991. That is typical of the Labor Party: do not let the Australian people know what it is doing about international agreements; sign away Australia's independence. That is what it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this particular UN committee. It has 18 people on it from different parts of the world. Five of those 18 countries have laws against homosexuality similar to those of Tasmania. Not only that, four of those countries have not even signed the first optional protocol. Its members deign to comment about the rights of people in other parts of the world when in their own countries they have done nothing about it at all. One of those people comes from Yugoslavia. I ask people to watch their televisions at night to see whether the human rights in Tasmania are more sustained than those in Yugoslavia. I do not think anybody in this House would have any doubts. Tasmania is a beautiful part of Australia. Some of the comments which have been made in this House and in other places about Tasmanian people are outrageous and wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee on which this government bases its reasons for acting meets in secret. You cannot cross-examine its members. It is accountable to nobody. People talk about privacy, and I acknowledge that is very important. But having the right of privacy is not the only thing that is important. Who protects the right of privacy if you do have it is also important. A state government in Australia is more likely to protect people's rights than an unelected, unaccountable UN committee would ever do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a federal government which is prepared to put more stock in an unelected overseas committee which accepted and did not question absolutely false evidence than it is in a duly elected state parliament. That is the nature of the Labor Party. I find it absolutely incredible that the government says, `We must have our own Australian identity; we must bring in the Australia Act and make sure that we do not have any reference to a court in another country; and we must make sure that our head of state is within this country,' when the genesis of this legislation comes from a decision made overseas. If there were a real reason to act with respect to these laws in Tasmania, why did the government not act when it was elected in 1983? Because this government puts more stock in an unelected overseas body which is totally unaccountable to anybody in the world. The government is prepared to do that and ignore duly elected state governments in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard people talking about state rights and human rights. This debate is not really about state rights and human rights; it is about human rights and people's rights. States do not have rights, but people within the states do have rights. The people in Tasmania have a right to elect their duly elected governments to make laws for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How this committee operated was very interesting. When the committee received the submission from Mr Toonen, it realised that it could not deal with it because `sexual preference' was not referred to in any of the United Nations conventions or treaties. So what did the committee do? It redefined what the word `sex' meant. That is how it got around it. That is how sneaky it was. It changed the definition of `sex' to include `sexual preference'. But up until that time it has not included it. As I said, the committee then accepted false information. I want to mention to the parliament some of that false information. First of all, Mr Toonen said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since lodging my communication I have lost my employment, partly as a result of this communication.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stopped working for the Tasmanian Aids Council on July 2nd, 1993 after 4 1/2 years employment as a result of an external review of the Council which recommended the termination of my employment. The review was imposed on the Aids Council by the Tasmanian Government through its Department of Community and Health Services.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actions by the Department were motivated by its concerns over my high profile complaint, the United Nations Human Rights Committee and my gay activist. At no time was there any question of my work performance being unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA>Each of those things is false. If we go back to the information provided we find that those statements are false. The UN committee did not question the falsehood of those comments. Yet this government deigns to come into this place and bring in legislation based on the fact that this committee accepts false information. I find it totally incredible that a government would do that, but it has, and the legislation is before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock). As a country, we have to take a good hard look at these international treaties and the way in which Australia deals with them. For too long we have avoided addressing new mechanisms whereby Australia signs and ratifies international treaties. I know that one of this government's purposes is to get rid of state governments. There is no place for a government in Australia to continually thwart the Australian constitution, but that is what this legislation does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to privacy is an important one. I acknowledge that. But no government&mdash;certainly not a Labor government, because Labor governments are the most intrusive governments this country has ever known&mdash;will protect my privacy. If we look through history we find that governments do not protect people's privacy or people's rights. They are more likely to take away people's rights. The rights of people will be protected only by the people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this government, with its intrusiveness and desire to bring in an ID card, to come in here and purport to protect the privacy of the Australian people is just beyond belief. This is the government that would bring in an ID card to intrude into our privacy. I say to the Australian people: this government cannot be trusted with this form of legislation. If anything, it will bring about difficulties for Australia rather than benefits. Privacy is important and people in Tasmania already have privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The laws governing the rights of police to enter and search private dwellings in Tasmania are very strong. This bill purports to protect a person's privacy with respect to their sexual conduct, but nobody's privacy has been intruded in this regard. So why is the legislation being introduced? There has been no invasion of privacy in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the Attorney-General, or any member of the government, to come in here and tell us where that privacy has been invaded. Tasmanian legislation is quite adequate and has adequately protected people's privacy. This legislation is purely a Labor Party political stunt. The Labor Party does not want to talk about the overseas debt. It does not want to talk about the Prime Minister buying a $2.2 million house. It does not want to talk about the lies being told by the Prime Minister. It does not want to discuss unemployment. It wants to evade the major issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not oppose this legislation, but I certainly cannot support it because of the reasons which I have outlined to you&mdash;that it is based on false information to an overseas, unelected and unaccountable body.

The explanatory memorandum has made the legislation perfectly clear. When we keep in mind that the Acts Interpretation Act places a responsibility on courts when considering legislation from this parliament to take into account the explanatory memorandum and also the second reading speech of the minister in introducing legislation, we cannot lightly dismiss the content of that explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been matters of personal subjective judgment, some personal observations, some claims with which I would not agree, some that I would dispute and some which did not provide as full a coverage of the particular points that have been dealt with as could have been provided. But, despite these reservations, I think the debate so far has been a fairly sensible one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on his second reading speech. That speech has probably made it unnecessary for members to canvass the details of the legislation, the legal implications of the legislation, the background to the development of treaty obligations by Australia and issues of that kind which are inherent in that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's second reading speech was moderate, balanced, objective and analytical. I would commend it to any person in this parliament or any person in the wider community who has any interest at all in the issues raised by this legislation and its implications. It was a very thoughtful presentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the comments that the Attorney-General made deserve repeating. The comments that I have chosen to repeat are not necessarily the most important but, to a large extent, they summarise my concerns about the matters that this legislation seeks to address, and they reveal the way in which the legislation is responding to the types of concerns which, quite correctly, are concerns for this parliament. In part, the Attorney-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, there is no more fundamental reason for the existence of governments but to respect and enhance the rights of citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that absolutely. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is about basic freedoms&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in particular, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the right of adult Australians to make their own choices about sexual practices within the privacy of their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA>I would think that that has got to be fairly fundamental. It addresses the question of whether it is appropriate for governments to intrude into matters of that kind&mdash;the intensely personal behaviour of people and their partners in the privacy of their own bedrooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General also reminded us&mdash;this is particularly relevant, especially in light of some of the comments that have been made by some members of the opposition&mdash;that it was the Liberal-National government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. That government did so after a long period of discussion with the Australian states. It is article 17 of that covenant on which this bill is founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney also said later in that second reading speech that most Australians probably take for granted that they live in a society in which they are free to pursue their private lives and, in particular, their private sexual lives free of unjustified government intrusion. That is the right enshrined in article 17&mdash;the right to be free from unjustified and unnecessary government interference in one's everyday private life. That is fundamental to the whole question of this government seeking to use the external affairs power, not necessarily and exclusively to deal with the particular problem which exists in Tasmania but to deal with it more generally over the whole of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not want to deal with all of the issues that were raised by the opposition speaker who immediately preceded me, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), it did not add very much to his concerns, which I understand, for him to be making comments of the kind that this was just a stunt by the Labor Party. One of the opposition speakers earlier today&mdash;I think it was the former shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams)&mdash;said that one of the motivations on the part of the government in introducing this legislation was to try to split the opposition. I think one of our speakers responded and said that we did not need to do that; opposition members have done it admirably for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims of this kind do not contribute anything to the debate. `It is a stunt by the Labor Party.' `One of the reasons the government introduced this is to attempt to split the opposition.' What absurdity. The honourable member also said that the rights of people should be protected. Of course they should. That is what this legislation is largely about. He said that governments are more often intrusive of the rights of citizens than protective of them. That is often very much the case. But, with the increasing level of social enlightenment, there is an increasing number of cases where governments, in responding to community concerns&mdash;not just state based or national based concerns but international community concerns&mdash;have found it necessary to become more intrusive in order to protect human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people might say, `This concerns sexual practices that we find a little abhorrent and unpleasant. Let us not be concerned about them.' But I have just made the objection that it is the intensely personal nature of the physical relationship between partners, between consenting adults, in the privacy of their own bedrooms that we are concerned about. Some people make the claim that this is a legitimate area for government involvement, that it is appropriate to have, in effect, governments, government agencies and law enforcement authorities peeping through the blinds of private bedrooms with binoculars. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose there are plenty of forms of human behaviour we all find unpleasant, but whether or not it is appropriate for governments to intrude into and proscribe those forms of behaviour is a completely different question. When it is so intrusive that is a completely different question. There is a quaint expression, I notice, used in the Tasmanian legislation that refers to the `order of nature'&mdash;human sexual behaviour which is `against the order of nature'. How quaint. Good heavens, I would not like to canvass the various types of personal sexual behaviour that all members of this House have engaged in. What a voyeuristic and interesting study that might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a quaint little expression from down in Tasmania, `against the order of nature'. I think it is even more serious to make some particular unpleasant behaviour a criminal offence. It is not just identified as something which offends the community or community susceptibilities or preferences. It is not just identified as something the general community might find offensive or unpleasant or distasteful. These people are criminals. These people are made criminals by that  legislation. There is a question involved in this whole area of public policy concern about just what we mean when we  talk, as we often do so glibly, about a liberal society, what we mean when we talk about a tolerant, open, libertarian, non-judgmental society&mdash;all laudable concepts. There are some people who are happy to mouth them but not so happy to enact them, to ensure that the society we seek to put into place is a society which encompasses all of those qualities. </PARA>

I find behaviour that is deliberately of a personally or socially provocative kind offensive. Often I find smoking in public places offensive. Public drunkenness, no longer an offence, I do not find very pleasant. Some forms of attire I do not find very pleasant. Oral language and sometimes body language I find most objectionable, most unpleasant, most distasteful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something of an understatement to say that the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 has been the subject of a great deal of public discussion and debate over recent times. It involves many competing issues but, to date, the debate has been centred on states rights and human rights. The issues involved are most certainly complex and go to the heart of the political balance between the Commonwealth and the states upon which our federation is based. Whatever we might think of the relevant law in Tasmania, the constitutional and legal issues cannot be ignored. The bill is not really about sodomy but has everything to do with the usurpation of our federal system of government and exposing Australia's sovereignty to the intrusions of foreign national bodies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), is under no misapprehension, I state that I am opposed to the bill. My reasons are straightforward but are not necessarily limited. The decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee was seriously flawed and failed to take into account the reservations of the Australian government at the time of ratification. State criminal codes are the responsibility of state governments and should not be overridden by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, relentless and ruthless use of the external affairs power in the constitution is undermining the system of checks and balances that the original division of powers between the states and Commonwealth was supposed to guarantee. This is a power grab by Labor, with centralisation and abolition of the states being amongst its objectives. Australian laws should be made, legislated and interpreted in Australia by our parliaments and our courts, and should not be determined by United Nations committees or any other foreign body. This bill, while purporting to further human rights, is inimical to the civil liberties of our citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assumption made by the government in introducing this bill is that the decision of the United Nations Human Rights Committee reflects Australia's obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and, in particular, articles 17 and 26 of the covenant. Article 17 is the article upon which this bill relies for its justification, though the law in Tasmania does not&mdash;I repeat, does not&mdash;breach this article. In part, the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one will be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour or reputation.</PARA>
<PARA>Forgive me for the sexist remarks. Those are the words of a United Nations committee, and I regret that the female gender was not included. The question that therefore needs answering is this: do sections 122 and 123 of the Tasmanian criminal code arbitrarily or unlawfully interfere with a person's privacy? The answer clearly is no. Sections 122 and 123 do not unlawfully interfere with rights to privacy. Their very inclusion in the criminal code, by way of legislative process, renders them lawful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for arbitrarily interfering with a person's privacy, it should be pointed out that there is nothing arbitrary about the enforcement of sections 122 and 123. Police can enter premises only where they believe a breach of sections 122 and 123 has occurred and where a warrant has been issued. For police action to be arbitrary, the action must be without reasonable cause. The Tasmanian criminal code already precludes any arbitrary enforcement of the law from occurring. Mr Ron Cornish, the Tasmanian Attorney-General, put it well when he said on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program of 21 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the reality here in Tasmania is that adults in private are not interfered with; there is no power for the police to enter and search private dwellings here in Tasmania, even on the suspicion that an offence may be committed under Sections 122 and 123 of the criminal code. Of the 46 convictions under these sections since 1976, there has not been a conviction against consenting adults in private&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;QED. Then there is the annexe to the relevant covenant that details the reservations and declarations Australia had when signing the United Nations covenant. The annexe for article 17 makes it clear that Australia, when signing the covenant, did so with the intent of not abdicating its ability to legislate in contravention of article 17 in the national interest, including the protection of public health or morals. From this, it is clear that the Tasmanian criminal code could not be found to be in breach of article 17, as ratified by Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interpretation of article 26 by the human rights commission to redefine the word `sex' to include sexual preference is an absolute nonsense. The purpose of article 26 is to ensure that all persons are treated equally before the law. That is the case in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of the drafting of the constitution of this country, the states agreed to a division of powers between the Commonwealth and the states. Some powers were to be the exclusive preserve of the Commonwealth, some were to be concurrent and the residual powers were to be the preserve of the states. I have heard no-one seriously disagree that criminal law has been the exclusive preserve of state governments, yet this government believes it has the ability to legislate on any issue, including the effective overriding of sections of Tasmania's criminal code. The federal compact to which the states originally agreed was a very different arrangement from that which now prevails. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constitutional change over almost 100 years is understandably inevitable, but the continuing march of the Commonwealth to increase its powers at the expense of the states has been relentless. The coalition strongly supports the federal system in which federal and state powers are distributed so as to encourage participation and to act as an effective barrier against centralist, remote and even, in extremes, authoritarian control. The use of the external affairs power of the constitution has enabled Labor to spuriously circumvent the original and clear intent of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill before us is nothing but a sham that will further reduce the legitimate areas of states' responsibilities. Our system of government at all levels and between different levels is reliant on a necessary process of checks and balances. Labor cannot and never will understand that it is the maintenance of checks and balances in our system of government that contributes towards the development  of a workable and sustainable democracy. Every tier of government should be obliged to work within fixed parameters and abide by the established constitutional framework and conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia under Labor is moving relentlessly towards centralised government. Labor has one major objective: to increase the power of the federal government and eventually abolish the states or reduce their power to such an extent that the state governments become no more than Commonwealth branch offices. Mr Wayne Goss, Australia's most successful Labor Premier, if only because he is the only one, and inheritor of the Bjelke-Petersen fiscal legacy, writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 21 September, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a real problem developing in the constitutional structure of this country. The continuing shift of power to Canberra is leading to the de facto abolition of the states. Public debate talks of a new Australian nation by 2001. I suspect the states de facto abolition will be complete by then.</PARA>
<PARA>The international trend, however, is in the opposite direction. Several European nations, including those in the Eastern bloc, are moving towards federal systems and encouraging political decentralisation and devolution of power. At the same time, business and the Australian Public Service are devolving powers and responsibilities to local areas and smaller business units while the federal government continues to buck the trend to pursue its policy of all power to the centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that our liberties and democratic system are best protected when the commitment to our federal system is strong. Christopher Pearson put the case against increased centralisation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 August. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no local shortage of object lessons in the tyranny of centralised power. People understand readily enough that any further concentration of power in Canberra is inimical to civil liberty in general. Defence of the constitution should start with why we need checks and balances on all government and why Lavarch's privacy bill is not a legitimate check on the Groom government.</PARA>
<PARA>After all is said and done, the fact remains that it is the democratically elected Tasmanian parliament which refuses to repeal its anti-sodomy laws. Whatever we might think of that, it is the right of the Tasmanian parliament to enact and to leave on the statute books laws which reflect the moral or other values of that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, it can be argued that the Tasmanian House of Assembly is far more democratic than is the House of Representatives. The House of Assembly in Tasmania is elected under the Hare-Clark system of multi-member electorates that better represents the breadth of opinion in the Tasmanian community. Let the Democrats stew on that when this bill gets to the Senate because they seem to be in favour of multimember electorates and proportional representation. I am sure they will display their democratic properties when they decide that the Tasmanian government, because it has a superior form of representation, should have the right to legislate and to leave on the statute books laws which reflect the moral or other values of that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fundamental human right that the people of Tasmania can elect a parliament which will determine the laws by which they live. There can be few more fundamental human rights than the right to elect a government by popular vote and for the government elected to govern by rule of law. If the Tasmanian people want to change the law, whether it applies to sodomy or anything else, they have the option of doing so via the ballot box or by normal political processes. Labor's so-called privacy bill is a denial of the democratic and human rights of the Tasmanian people and should be rejected for that reason alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another principle preventing my support for this bill is my belief that Australian law should be made, legislated and interpreted in Australia by our parliaments and courts. International committees, whether they be from the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation or the like, should have no role in making our laws. For a start, international treaties are ratified by the executive government of Australia with parliament and the states having no formally guaranteed role in the ratification process. The federal government, prior to ratifying a new treaty, may consult with the states, business and other interest groups, but if the government nevertheless wants to become a party to a treaty the ratification cannot be stopped. This poses a dilemma because Australia is currently a signatory to about 900 treaties and is considering signing 60 other treaties within the space of the next 12 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By using the external affairs power, treaties have been employed to increase the scope of federal power at the expense of the states.

With more and more Australian law being determined by international agencies that are accountable to nobody, it is Australians who are being disenfranchised. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 11 October, Sir Ninian Stephen is quoted during his recent Sir Earl Page lecture as having said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>International agencies and their appeal committees, such as the UN Human Rights Committee, are accountable to no-one in Australia, not even the Australian government. What faith can the Australian people have in these agencies when we cannot be certain that the people on international committees have the experience, qualifications and insight to make a valid appeal decision? Obviously, we cannot have faith in such abilities, as the decision in the Toonan case, where the UN Human Rights Committee got it totally wrong, attests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's parliaments and courts are ultimately accountable to the Australian people. These institutions also have a knowledge of Australia's law, history and other institutional arrangements that an international agency could never hope to acquire. If international treaties are to determine Australian laws or, at the very least, influence them in some way, it is necessary that the federal parliament and the states have a role to play in ratification of treaties. It is not good enough that the executive can ratify treaties that have the potential to have an effect upon the operations of not only the Commonwealth government but also the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the constitution was originally drafted and accepted by all the colonies at referenda, the external affairs power was in no way intended to apply as it now does in the context of this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4, which is the heart of the bill, raises several questions which have been discussed in many forums but which have been largely dismissed by the government and by other supporters of this bill. It is quite clear that, if this bill applies to consenting adults, who are defined as persons of 18 years or more, committing sodomy in private, it must also apply to prostitution and incest where those persons are consenting adults and the acts take place in private. The legislation creates a right to sexual privacy. Mark Baker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 24 September stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation is also expected to spur argument that, if a right to sexual privacy exists, then there must also be rights to other forms of privacy, and those rights should be protected by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Some legal analysts believe this bill could also be used to protect the privacy of individuals from the arbitrary actions of the Australian Taxation Office, the Australian Securities Commission, the Trade Practices Commission and other government agencies. Whatever the merit of that argument, the point is that this bill sets a standard against which other privacy issues will be judged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill could also form the basis of a de facto bill of rights, one concept of which was rejected in 1988. Just as importantly, especially in the short term, this bill shows all Australians that Labor has sacrificed the federal system for the accolades of noisy, unrepresentative lobby groups. The majority obviously matter little to Labor because it lacks the clout of minority pressure groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides, this bill is futile because there is no legal issue at stake for consenting adult Tasmanians committing sodomy in the privacy of their own homes. As we all know, Tasmanian police do not prosecute where the act is committed in private. All that will be achieved by this legislation is the further erosion of Australia's sovereignty, a degrading of our federal compact, which is now almost in tatters, and the alienation of the Tasmanian people who surely have the right to govern themselves in accordance with truly democratic and truly Australian principles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this very important bill. The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill 1994 provides that sexual conduct between consenting adults over the age of 18 acting in private will not be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference. This is a bill which has not been considered to be necessary in the past because it contains basic human rights and reflects human values which many people take for granted as being basic commonsense. However, because of the refusal of some state governments to remove outdated, draconian laws from their statute books and the attempts by reactionary forces in our community, including some of those opposite, to make cheap political mileage from this by using it to espouse their misguided and monotonous support for so-called states rights, it has become necessary to enact this legislation in order that our laws in this democratic society reflect international standards as outlined in article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1980 to which Australia is a party. Article 17, paragraph 1, of the covenant provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his or her honour and reputation</PARA>
<PARA>One would have thought that was a perfectly reasonable statement of principle to which nobody in this House or in the community could possibly object. But it is important to put this bill and this whole debate into some context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the outset, let me stress that this bill is talking about sexual conduct between and involving only consenting adults in private. We are not talking about sexual conduct involving children or child abuse. We are not talking about acts of sexual assault or domestic violence of a sexual nature. We are not talking about incest, despite what the previous speaker, the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has said. We are not talking about sexual conduct involving animals, or conduct which would amount to professional misconduct, or about laws involving sexual abuse of people with an intellectual disability, and we are not talking about laws which regulate the sex industry, despite what the honourable member for Curtin said. We are talking only about acts of consent between people over 18 years in private. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise this point so that this bill is not misrepresented by those opposite or by anyone else for mischievous political reasons: what we are talking about is the ability of adults to engage in mutually consensual sexual conduct in the privacy of their own homes without the fear of interference or intrusion by law enforcement agencies or other people. Although the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has said that the opposition will not oppose this bill, there are still some on the opposition benches who will oppose it, as has been made quite obvious today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) pointed out in question time in the last sitting week of September, there are more positions existing in the Liberal Party on this bill than are illegal in Tasmania under its laws. All I can say to those opposite intending to oppose this bill is to listen very carefully to what I have to say and what other government speakers have to say. I mean that in all seriousness. This is a very serious issue. If they listen to the debate and take it on its merits, they should not and could not possibly oppose this bill. Those who oppose this bill represent the peeping toms of Australian politics&mdash;those who would look through the keyholes of the bedrooms of Australian people to see which way they have sex in their own homes. I think that is disgusting, which is why this bill is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill underlines a very important principle in our democracy. It highlights the importance of the distinction between moral values and beliefs on the one hand and legal rights on the other. I state the obvious when I say that a wide range of differing beliefs on social and moral issues exists in our society. In a democracy it is appropriate that these different views and beliefs exist and that individuals have the right to hold different views on issues. The important point here is that individuals do have this right so long as they do not seek to impose their views on others who have differing views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key features in our democratic system is freedom of religion. In Australia a number of different religions and denominations are practised. Christianity is the dominant religion but, in our increasingly multicultural society, there are also significant numbers of Muslims, Buddhists, Jews and Hindus. The Christian religion itself is represented by a number of different denominations, while there are also a large number of Australians who do not subscribe to any religion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, there are many Australians who, because of their religious beliefs or their personal moral values, do not approve of certain types of sexual conduct. This particularly applies to homosexual conduct, as we have heard. It is these people in particular who are being targeted by the government's political opponents and who are being urged to oppose the bill currently before us. But, while these people have every right to hold their own personal beliefs about certain types of sexual conduct, it is important to remind all Australians that this bill is about legal rights, about human rights, not about imposing moral values. As the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) pointed out earlier today, it is about the difference between a sin and a crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate this point further by making some valid comparisons. As I said, many people, due to their religious beliefs or for other reasons, do not approve of certain lifestyles or certain forms of conduct, including sexual conduct. For example, there are still people in our society who do not approve of sexual intercourse or any sexual activity outside marriage. Indeed, up until the early 1960s it could be argued that this was a prevailing majority view of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one had conducted a survey in, say, 1960, one may have found that a majority of Australians did not approve of sex before marriage at that time. I doubt whether you would get such an outcome today, of course. But there would still be some people, especially older folk, who would not approve of sexual conduct before marriage. It is their right, in our democracy, to hold those beliefs as long as they do not attempt to force others to conform to their views, especially through draconian laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point here is that, even in past decades when more people may have disapproved of what might have been termed permissive sexual conduct, that did not make such conduct illegal. I am not aware that sex between consenting heterosexual adults in private has ever been against the law in this country, no matter what the prevailing social, religious or moral views of a particular time might have been. So this debate is ultimately about the difference between moral values which, by nature, differ between individuals and can be subjective and legal human rights which, by definition, have to be the same for everyone in an egalitarian democracy like ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example. Most religious denominations disapprove of sexual activity outside one's own marriage, commonly referred to as adultery. When I went to school we were taught that one of the Ten Commandments stated, `Thou shall not commit adultery,' and many people believe this to be an appropriate community standard, whether or not they are religious people. It could be argued, if a survey was carried out today, that a majority of Australians would say that they do not approve of adultery. Apart from religious beliefs, many would consider that the term `adultery' implies deception or a breach of trust between partners which is therefore morally unethical or undesirable. Notwithstanding this, nobody ever says that it should be illegal, at least not in a democracy like Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take this argument a step further. Some religions take the view that sexual relations even inside marriage should occur only when a married couple is attempting to have children. This may seem like an extreme view to take in the 1990s&mdash;or some may consider it an extreme interpretation on my part&mdash;but it does form the basis of the longstanding opposition to contraception expressed by some religious organisations. How could anyone seriously imagine how a government could possibly make laws, let alone enforce them, which would outlaw sexual conduct which is not intended for reproduction purposes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How would we monitor sexual activity to determine whether it was for pleasure or procreation? As I have said, people with the moral or religious views that I have mentioned have every right to hold those views. It would clearly be ludicrous for any government to try to enforce them in legislation, even if they did represent the views of the majority of people&mdash;which, in this case, they would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just as clear in my opinion that it is ludicrous and wrong for the Tasmanian government, or any other government, to try to enforce its draconian laws that have become the subject of the public debate leading to the introduction of this bill. While people may have very strong personal views about homosexuality, or various forms of sexual conduct, it is not the place of governments or law enforcement agencies to interfere in the private affairs of consenting adults. When a colleague of mine was asked what he thought about homosexuality his only comment was that he had no problem with it as long as it was not made compulsory. That might be a throwaway line, but it certainly sums up the whole essence of this bill and what democracy is about&mdash;freedom of choice. I believe that is the whole point of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must emphasise that, while all Australians have a right to their own moral beliefs, values and standards and to apply those standards to their own behaviour, none of us has the right to impose our own beliefs, values or standards on those who have different views. Nobody has a right to intrude on the privacy of consenting adults&mdash;I stress `consenting adults'&mdash;who choose to engage in their choice of sexual conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, freedom of religion is an important feature of our own democracy. The role of the church in our democracy is separate from the role of governments. Indeed, the Australian constitution&mdash;the same constitution that we hear so much righteous indignation about from the conservative side of politics&mdash;provides that a government shall not establish a religion. This is a clear statement of the importance in our democracy of the separation of the church and the state. This is an important principle; just as important, in my view, as the Westminster doctrine in relation to the separation of powers of the legislature, the administration and the judiciary. It is a principle which further underlines the points I have been making about the distinction between moral values and human and legal rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we hear from those opposite? What do we hear from the Liberal Party and the National Party in this place? The Liberal Party, of course, claims to be the party of the individual; the party whose very creation by Sir Robert Menzies&mdash;which I believe will be featured on ABC television tonight&mdash;was based on the ideals of freedom of speech and the primacy of individual rights over the power of the state. I acknowledge that on this issue the more moderate members of the Liberal Party have had the good sense to at least not oppose this bill, even if they cannot bring themselves to say that they support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what about the rest of them? What ever happened to individual rights? What do we hear about individual rights from those opposite&mdash;these peeping toms of Australian politics? Apart from the displays of prejudice and authoritarianism evident from some speakers, we have had to listen to the usual nonsense about states rights. To the Liberal Party, states rights are now apparently more important than individual rights or basic human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as we have seen in recent times and as we continue to see, to these redneck conservatives, states rights are also more important than Aboriginal rights when it comes to land title. They are also apparently more important than the rights of consumers to an equitable and efficient economic system, or the right of families to access government funded child care&mdash;particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, apparently&mdash;or access to other community services or health services. Apparently, states rights are more important than the rights of public housing tenants to receive adequate public housing in many states of Australia. In so many policy areas at the moment Australians are being denied the benefits of the social justice initiatives and programs of this federal Labor government because of the obstructionism and petty power politics of conservative state governments asserting their states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States do not have rights; people have rights. Indeed, no government at any level has the right to interfere with the basic human rights and individual freedoms and lifestyle choices that this bill seeks to protect. Until the coalition parties learn this basic tenet of democracy and social justice, they will continue to be where they are right now&mdash;on the opposition benches.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Ombudsman's report be made available for parliamentary debate.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the minister has not yet formally replied to these&mdash;and I have to wonder why&mdash;I read a copy of the Ombudsman's report many weeks ago. It highlights deficiencies and, arguably, culpability on the part of individuals at Aerospace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd and of the Civil Aviation Authority, especially of the latter's structural integrity branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian designed and built Nomad, which operates here and overseas, both in civilian register and defence roles, has had a chequered history of operational constraint, of grounding, of in-flight incident and, in the extreme, of fatal accident in Australia and, unfortunately, overseas. In the latest fiasco I am informed that, arising from a major in-flight incident in the West Indies with a Nomad, remarkably like an incident with an RAAF aircraft at Tindal in the Northern Territory a couple of years ago, further bulletins have been issued by Aerospace Technologies of Australia and others which impose additional operational constraints. In particular, these bulletins deal with a maximum of 10 degrees of flap utilisation and further weight and power setting limitations, which make a nonsense of the aircraft's supposed short take-off and landing, or STOL, design characteristics, so important in both the defence and civilian roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent Lord Howe Island bound aircraft accident and the justifiably criticised role of the Civil Aviation Authority and, I have to say, of the responsible minister, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), raised urgent and serious questions not only for the Minister for Defence in the context of my questions but also for the Minister for Transport in his wider role. I therefore ask the Minister for Defence when I might expect a reply to my question and all of its ramifications. However, I understand that a number of Australian Defence Force aircraft are grounded at the moment until the serious deficiencies are resolved. Of course, as a result, a large measure of confusion and operational penalties persist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Minister for Transport whether he has seen the Ombudsman's report? Has he been briefed by CAA officials on the Adelaide accident and their reaction to the Ombudsman's criticisms? Is the minister fully satisfied that civil registered Nomads are&mdash;and I emphasise it&mdash;safe? Is he going to ground these aircraft in Australia until all operational question marks are resolved, or will he sit back as he did with Aero Commander aircraft similar to the one that crashed en route to Lord Howe Island?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, is the minister taking appropriate action with the Minister for Defence and overseas authorities to resolve the aircraft's obvious shortcomings? Near enough is demonstrably not good enough when it comes to aircraft safety, and I raise these issues as an important matter of public importance. I hope both ministers in this case will review the situation and fix it as a matter of extreme urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As you would know, Mr Speaker, the seat of Corio encompasses the great provincial city of Geelong. With your interest in matters of football, you would be aware that the Geelong football side recently played in the Australian Football League grand final. Unfortunately, we were not successful in that contest. In this adjournment debate tonight, I would like to pass on my congratulations to Ron Hovey, to the members of the Geelong Football Club committee and to the coach and players for the magnificent effort of getting into the AFL grand final. That particular committee in Geelong contains a former Labor minister of a former state government in Victoria, Nipper Trezise. I know Nipper was very sad at the defeat of Geelong at the hands of the West Coast Eagles. Let me pass on my congratulations to the West Coast Eagles on their fine performance on the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Geelong Football Club, it was a magnificent effort. We proved to be the best football side in the state of Victoria. We, a provincial football side, proved to be the masters of a state side in South Australia, a state side in Queensland and a state side in New South Wales. So, all in all, it has been a successful season for the Geelong Football Club and the people of Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, a victory in an AFL grand final would have brought considerable economic benefits to the city of Geelong, but still there were some great spin-offs for us. It gave the city and the region national and international exposure. Indeed, the support that was given by the Geelong community to the side, in its victories leading up to grand final day and in defeat, displayed the sort of spirit that has been the hallmark of this community in coping with some fairly severe economic problems in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I am pleased to report to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House, that in this very important manufacturing region of the Commonwealth the economic outlook is becoming brighter indeed. I refer to an assessment made by the City of Greater Geelong in the quarterly survey that was produced for the June quarter of this year. Some of the major statistics incorporated in that survey show significant improvements in economic activity. For example, retailing is up 21.8 per cent; manufacturing production is up some 12.6 per cent; and service production is up some 22.8 per cent. There were 1,690 new vehicles registered. The important thing about those registrations was the significant improvement in commercial vehicle registrations in the city. Building activity is continuing to show strong growth, with factory and shop developments surging in those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as employment growth is concerned, I would like to refer you, Mr Speaker, to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong Advertiser</EMPHASIS> of 11 October 1994. The headline was `Region surges ahead in job figures'. As far as the ANZ Bank job survey is concerned, in Geelong the job vacancies advertised rose by some 60 per cent over the last 12 months, which compares with a Victorian average of 49 per cent. This confirms the trend data from the CES and Social Security, which also measures a significant decline in the number of unemployed in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that one of initiatives that the government recently announced in the white paper was the jobs action Geelong program, which has received widespread support from the community and business groups in the Geelong region. In some couple of months of operation, it has yielded in excess of 350 new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at car manufacturing&mdash;honourable members would be aware that Geelong has within its boundaries a significant motor vehicle production facility in Ford&mdash;we see that there is a very strong demand for cars nationally. This has spilled over to Ford. After the release of the new EF model Falcon, some 7,547 units were sold in a record performance. This has spilled over to the motor vehicle automotive component manufacturers, who have done very well indeed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening in the adjournment debate I bring to the attention of honourable members some changes that are taking place in my area in the management of ABC regional radio as it relates to journalists. I note that the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) is in the chamber. Part of his area is also affected by these changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position filled by the journalist who had been stationed at Taree in my electorate on a part-time basis&mdash;it is considered as half a job by the ABC&mdash;has been relocated to Coffs Harbour. I believe that the journalist who was servicing the area of Taree, Forster/Tuncurry and Gloucester has gone on and found other employment in Newcastle. The important point is that we have lost the services of a resident journalist in that region and that position, as a result of a decision taken by management at whatever level, has been relocated into the Coffs Harbour area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABC regional radio in the region is based at Kempsey. That base services Kempsey and Port Macquarie. Until this move was made there had been outposts, as they call them, at Coffs Harbour and Taree. Now there is nothing at Taree, so we have to be serviced by the journalists at Kempsey, which is really not satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taree outpost services the biggest ABC audience in this region in an area which includes the fastest growing town in New South Wales&mdash;Forster/Tuncurry&mdash;the population of which grew by 30 per cent in the period 1986-91. The city of greater Taree grew by 25 per cent in that period. In contrast, Coffs Harbour grew by only 14 per cent. Audience response on 2KPTR is by far greatest in the region encompassing Forster/ Tuncurry, Taree and Gloucester. As I said, Gloucester is in the electorate of Paterson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 60 per cent or a little more of the quiz calls and community announcement requests and other random contact have come from this area. There appear to be two main reasons for that: a good signal from 2TR, a relatively new AM transmitter, and two supplementary FM services; and the fact that competitive media does not perform perhaps as well as it should. By contrast, audience response from Coffs Harbour is not as strong. It is a highly competitive electronic market, with ABC Lismore sending its signal down into the Coffs Harbour area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been led to believe by people within the ABC that all discussions about upgrading the position in Coffs Harbour to a full-time position have been carried out entirely in the context of the closure of the Grafton outpost and the reallocation of part of its resources. The understanding that was given at that time was that Lismore agreed with this course of action and would contribute half a position to top up Coffs Harbour and use the other half to establish an outpost in the Tweed. At no stage during those discussions was it ever mooted that the Taree outpost should be closed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some interesting statistics have been brought to light by the research that has been undertaken following these actions. The information coming from the Department of Planning indicates that the Coffs Harbour outpost covers Coffs Harbour and Bellingen, with a population of 70,400. The Kempsey newsroom covers Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, with a population of 91,500 people. The Taree outpost, as it was, covered Taree, Forster/Tuncurry and Gloucester, with a population of 71,900. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New population projections about to be released by the Department of Planning give the following population estimates for the areas in the year 2001: Coffs Harbour, 79,000; Nambucca, Kempsey and Port Macquarie, 112,000; and Taree, Forster, Tuncurry and Gloucester, 89,000. The actual urban centre populations are: Coffs Harbour, 20,326; Forster and Tuncurry, 14,578; and Taree 16,300. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So between the base of Taree, Forster and Tuncurry there are over 30,000 people in the urban centres and in Coffs Harbour only 20,000. I want to bring that matter to the attention of the House. I will be writing to the minister concerned about this change, pointing out that we are leaving a large section, geographically and population-wise, unserviced by ABC regional radio on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. I will urge the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to look at the situation and attempt to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, on the adjournment, I wish to touch upon a resolution that was successfully passed at the ALP National Conference at Hobart in regard to workers' rights. The motion proposed by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) asked the party to broaden and deepen its efforts to achieve greater workers' rights including the following ILO conventions: Nos 87 and 98, freedom of association and rights to organise collective bargaining; Nos 100 and 111, equity and non-discrimination; Nos 29 and 105, forced labour; No. 138, child labour and the right to work in a safe environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It called upon the government to enhance its development of technical assistance in efforts to support the development of workers' rights particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. It also called upon the government to involve itself in the establishment of a well-resourced, high level tripartite working party which would have representatives from the ACTU, Australian industry and government. It comes at a time when these issues have been highlighted throughout the parliament. In the Senate there was a motion on the subject of child labour. A month ago in this place there was a private member's motion on the subject of child labour. That is the aspect of the motion that was passed in Hobart that I wish to touch upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To his credit, in a speech in Melbourne on 6 September, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of all the forms of exploitation and abuse which the ILO strives to combat none is more serious than child labour.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to talk about the program that the ILO had in place to tackle the problem of child labour. There was a three-pronged approach to this program: firstly, the adoption of measures to end the employment of children who are in hazardous occupations or working under conditions of slavery, that is, forced labour; secondly, measures which would raise the information and awareness and therefore attempt to change attitudes; and, thirdly, targeting the underlying causes of child labour, namely, poverty, unemployment, inadequate social protection and educational systems. In this speech, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have asked my Department to closely monitor the ILO's program of eliminating child labour and consider possible means by which we may be able to contribute to the program.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, as you are well aware, I was fortunate to lead a parliamentary delegation to south Asia last year. One of the issues that that delegation took particular interest in was the question of child labour. One of the disappointments that the delegation expressed was that, in the briefings that we received from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade before we left, the issue of child labour was not raised. Apparently, at that time it was an issue that our diplomatic missions were not monitoring. I hope that, as this becomes an issue&mdash;and the ACTU and this parliament are raising it as important&mdash;we will find that departments such as DFAT take a more particular interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not to say that in those three countries child labour is not acknowledged as a problem. Whilst we were in Nepal, English language newspapers had two editorials on child labour. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kathmandu Post</EMPHASIS> of 8 December talked about Nepal being a signatory to both the UN and the SAARC resolution on the protection of children's rights. Its editorial concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the exploitation of children has assumed chronic proportions and the Task Force may just be fighting a losing battle. With children employed in all walks of life involving menial labour, the alleviation of their plight may be easier said than done as its roots lie in poverty and the child's labour no doubt contributes to the family income in a significant way.</PARA>
<PARA>Poverty is acknowledged by the ILO strategy as a great cause of child labour. On 5 December, whilst we were there, there was another editorial on child labour in another English newspaper in Kathmandu, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rising Nepal</EMPHASIS>. It commenced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child labour is indeed pathetic touching upon the soft corner on the human mind.</PARA>
<PARA>It talked about a group under the chairmanship of the President of the Nepal-German Chamber of Industry and Commerce which had `decided to check the exploitation of child labour in the production of carpets exported from Nepal'. These are significant developments because in Nepal, Bangladesh and India child labour is an important problem. We also had the opportunity to talk to trade union bodies. Again, I hope DFAT will take more trouble to get to know about industrial relations matters in those countries. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family has traditionally acted as the foundation of Western civilization. The family is a tangible manifestation of the shared destiny of people united by blood or marriage.

It provides a framework to facilitate: a cooperative national approach to the environment; a better definition of the roles of the respective governments; a reduction in the number of disputes between the Commonwealth, the states and territories on environmental issues; greater certainty of government and business decision making; and, importantly, better environment protection by integrating environmental considerations into the decision making processes of all governments at the project, program and policy levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Environment Protection Council Bill 1994 provides the legislative basis for the establishment of a national environment protection council, as per the intergovernmental agreement on the environment in 1992. That came about, I suppose, because the Commonwealth has no express powers under the constitution in relation to the environment. However, over the last 20 years or so, the Commonwealth has increasingly used other heads of power under the constitution to achieve its required policy outcomes. At the special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in 1990, the question of a national environment strategy was discussed and that resulted in the intergovernmental agreement on the environment being signed by the Commonwealth, the states and the territory and local governments in 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now this agreement has taken four years and three ministers&mdash;it is a sort of moving feast&mdash;to come to pass. But it has sought to ensure a comprehensive coverage of a number of environmental issues, which the bill spells out and which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) has referred to, and which are attached in a schedule to the bill. The IGAE was to provide a mechanism to facilitate a cooperative national approach to the environment. I have to say that is an approach which we very much welcome&mdash;perhaps I will come back to that in a minute. It outlines the roles of the respective governments to reduce the number of disputes between the Commonwealth and the states on environmental issues. It is aimed at greater certainty for government and business and, certainly, ensuring better environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council will be responsible for the publication, the dissemination, the monitoring and the reporting on the implementation and effectiveness of the NEPMs&mdash;the measures, in other words. As mentioned, they will be established in areas of air quality, water quality, noise control, general guidelines for the assessment of site contamination, hazardous waste, motor vehicle emissions and recycling of materials. In a way, the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech was not exactly correct when he said that the measures aim to give Australians the benefit of equivalent environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be better and more accurately said that the cooperative arrangements would be aimed at giving minimum equivalent environmental protection and that some people and some states will of course be taking other measures. We do note that the circumstances of the various issues in the various states will be different, and we notice that this bill provides for some differences to be taken into account. The agreement allows those states which wish to apply more stringent standards than those prevailing under the national environmental protection measures to do so if they wish, thus ensuring minimum standards across the country by cooperation rather than by imposition of these measures from above. The cost of establishment will be shared fifty-fifty between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From our point of view, all states agreed with this approach except Western Australia, and we were mindful of its concerns, which were substantial. They were that the NEPC overrides the state minister and cabinet, with the state parliament forfeiting powers to disallow regulations. They believe, in Western Australia, that uniform national standards are impractical, but I have to say that this bill does make some allowance for that. They believe that local solutions are required because of regional diversity. They believe very strongly that the NEPC adds a new layer of administration which will only reduce international competitiveness. They believe that it has the possibility of being administratively inefficient, and that it duplicates state processes and will add to the existing mechanisms of ANZECC and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is merit in those arguments. However, on the other side of it, our judgment was that, firstly, because the NEPC allows the Premier to appoint a state representative, with the measures only applying to activities that are subject to Commonwealth law or implemented by the states, and, secondly, because any decisions have the support of at least two-thirds of the members, on balance, notwithstanding the problems the Western Australians had, we should be enthusiastic in supporting this process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps proof of this pudding and whether those reservations of the Western Australians can be set aside will come about in the eating. By reason of the facts that the NEPC should aim for cooperation and consistency and not absolutely exact uniformity and that it is required to take notice of these regional variations&mdash;which are so obvious that this hardly needs saying&mdash;and the cost effectiveness and the social and economic impacts as well, we came down well on the side of implementing what the other states had all agreed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the strong reasons for this, as the other states have spelt it out to us&mdash;and we have had some changes of governments in those states since 1990 at least&mdash;is that they want to be in a situation where, in a cooperative way, they have control of their own destiny and do not have these things thrust upon them by the introduction of international treaties, as we see happening in other areas often enough and are, I am sure, likely to see in other areas in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in February of this year, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), the former minister for the environment, said that in such areas as air and water quality, hazardous waste, motor vehicle emissions and recycling, the emphasis would be on harmonised national measures rather than on uniformity. We agree with that, and that is why we introduced that emphasis in our sadly defeated second reading amendment in the Senate. Nevertheless, the fact of the matter is that the cooperative harmonisation approach is the one that we favour, and we will be insisting on it wherever we have any chance to be influential in this matter at all. It is the approach that the states will be demanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that from my conversation with the state ministers there is a degree of enthusiasm about this thing which is very healthy. The enthusiasm is really about the realisation that in many of these areas the states would like to do things. They would like to be solving the problems of air pollution, water pollution and so forth but they know that for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the dreadful problem of dollars, in many cases they are operating at a much lesser level than they would like to be operating at and without the combined wisdom and resources of a greater group&mdash;the other states and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important thing about this is that I think that once a group of people make a decision, and in this case the ministers have made a decision to go down a certain course, it is much more likely that nobody will split off later as long as that decision is made with a free mind. For our part, we are in favour of this bill. We believe that it will help immensely to sort out some of the problems around the states. More than that, we believe that some of the greater problems of air pollution and water pollution and those matters which transgress right across the borders of the states of this Commonwealth have to be dealt with. </PARA>

Although we have seen a report of the status of the delivery of CO(2) emissions from various sources in Australia, I hope that this council will discuss in very great detail whether or not such things as the natural sinks in this country should be included in a formula for Australia. Whatever the international community says on this subject, we should include the whole range of possibilities in regard to both the emission and absorption of these greenhouse gases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was perturbed recently to see that it is possible that not all of the various possibilities have been included in that report that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) launched not long ago which categorised the various areas of greenhouse emissions and absorptive sinks in this country. Some of those that had been evaluated were not included in the net figures. Therefore, in one way or another Australia looks as though it is a large contributor to this on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about it, I hope that the council of ministers&mdash;the environment protection council&mdash;will discuss in detail whether these sorts of measures should be included, whether it is a reasonable thing that the land mass of Australia should be able to be included as a sink, even the fertilisation effect which is a matter of some scientific contention. Further, although this is slightly off the subject, the seas that belong to this country ought also to be put into the category of having a potential for absorbing these greenhouse gases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the coalition is in favour of this bill and suggests to the government that it really is up to the federal minister and the government of Australia to prove that the whole of the cooperative basis of this bill, so well spelled out in the bill itself, is adhered to. If it is, it should be a great success. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 25 February 1992 the heads of government of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories, and representatives of local government, concluded the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. The IGAE provides a mechanism to achieve five stated aims: first, a cooperative national approach to the environment; second, a better definition of the roles of the Commonwealth, state and local governments; third, a reduction in the number of disputes between the Commonwealth, the states and the territories on environment issues; fourth, greater certainty of decision making for government and business; and, fifth, better protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties to the agreement acknowledged that there is a substantial benefit for Australians in the establishment of national environmental protection standards, guidelines, goals and associated protocols. An objective of such environmental protection measures is the achievement for all Australians of equivalent protection from air, water and soil pollution and from noise, regardless of where they live. Another objective is to ensure that decisions can be made by business and industry without the problem of the fragmentation of markets caused by jurisdictional variations in the implementation of major environmental protection measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement provides for the establishment of a national ministerial council, the NEPC, whose purpose is to establish national environment protection measures. The agreement requires that the measures be implemented by each separate jurisdiction in Australia. For this purpose, legislation would be required in each jurisdiction. The council will be given the power and responsibility to consult, publish reports, undertake research, disseminate information to the public, seek and obtain advice, and monitor and report on the implementation and effectiveness of the measures. The Commonwealth is required to implement measures in respect of activities which are subject to Commonwealth law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill, measures will be established in seven specific areas: ambient air quality; ambient marine, estuarine and freshwater quality; protection of the amenity in relation to noise in circumstances where differences in environmental requirements relating to noise would have an adverse effect on national markets for goods and services; general guidelines for the assessment of site contamination; environmental impacts associated with hazardous wastes; the reuse and recycling of used materials; and motor vehicle noise and emissions. The national environment protection measures are envisaged to be minimum standards only. If it wishes, a state may apply more stringent standards in its jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among remaining major features of the bill are the establishment of an NEPC service corporation and the appointment of an executive officer to the council to conduct the affairs of the service corporation. The bill will establish a standing committee of officials, together with such other committees as the council requires, to advise it in the conduct of its affairs in accordance with Commonwealth financial and administrative requirements. Finally, the bill requires the council and the parties to the agreement to report annually to parliament on the implementation and effectiveness of the national environment protection measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the membership of the council, the council is to consist of a minister of each participating state and territory, nominated by the premier or chief minister of that state or territory, and a Commonwealth minister nominated by the Prime Minister. The bill provides that the Commonwealth minister is the chairperson of the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the bill, national environment protection measures concerning motor vehicle noise and emissions must be agreed to by the National Road Transport Commission and be established in accordance with the provisions of the National Road Transport Commission Act and the Motor Vehicle Standards Act, where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides that a measure must consist of at least one of the following: a national environment protection standard goal, guideline or protocol, each of those terms being defined. When prescribing a measure, the council must take into account a number of factors, including cost effectiveness, social and economic impacts and any other existing relevant international treaties or intergovernmental mechanisms. The bill requires the council to give notice by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> and in a national newspaper before drafting a measure, and an impact statement must be prepared in respect of the measure when it is drafted. The bill requires the council to consult publicly in the setting of measures and to take account of any submissions received or advice received from the NEPC standing committee, and the measures will be subject to the scrutiny of parliament in that they will be in the form of disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quorum of a meeting of the council is at least two-thirds of the members, and decisions of the council must be supported by two-thirds of the members, whether present or not. The bill contemplates that subcommittees of council may be formed to aid in its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth does not have direct power under the constitution to legislate with respect to the environment. In recent years the Commonwealth has increasingly used other heads of power under section 51 to achieve its required policy aims. We have, of course, seen the Commonwealth's use of the external affairs power in conjunction with the existence of international treaties in relation to Queensland rainforests and Tasmanian wilderness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition's view, it is most undesirable for the Commonwealth to use the external affairs power merely as a device to allow it to legislate over the heads of the states. In a practical sense it should be recognised that the federal-state compact under the constitution gives the states responsibilities and the states have legislative power, administrative machinery and local knowledge necessary to determine the most desirable environmental outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised that it seems that it may be counterproductive in the area of the environment for the Commonwealth to engage in bullying the states into taking action when the states have not been adequately consulted or when the states believe there is a better way to approach a particular problem. The cooperative legislative model prescribed by this bill is in that sense a welcome recognition by the government, and not before time, of the legitimate role of the states in relation to environmental issues. The cooperative model is one that reflects the federal nature of our system of government, a recognition that the government has not been consistent in pursuing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 the Hawke government introduced the Corporations Bill into parliament in the belief that it had complete legislative competence to enact laws to regulate companies and securities. In the light of the successful challenge in the High Court to aspects of the act, the government was forced to enter into negotiations with the states in order to create a modified version of a cooperative national scheme. To achieve this outcome, the Commonwealth was obliged to make concessions to the states. These concessions were important because they became part of the legislative model that recognised the valid role of the states in the Australian system of government. If the proposed scheme under this bill is an indication that government has learnt from its mistakes and does genuinely want to cooperate with the states in seeing the continuation of a working, dynamic and vital federation, it is very much to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One disadvantage of all legislative strategies, not only national ones, is that an incoming government, whether it be state or Commonwealth, may quite legitimately decide that it is not in the interests of the state, the territory or the Commonwealth, as the case may be, to continue to abide by the legislative agreement signed by a previous government. This is both a legal and a political reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a national legislative scheme such as this, the state has the ability to withdraw from the agreement and that provides some security for that state in negotiating with the Commonwealth. Public and political pressure would militate against a state or territory withdrawing from the NEPC scheme without good cause. But it is a fundamental feature of our federal system that a state will act in the best interests of its own people, where necessary, in the face of inappropriate Commonwealth initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for these reasons that the Western Australian government has chosen not to participate in the National Environment Protection Council. It is the only government of a state or territory to elect not to join in the national scheme at its initiation. The Western Australian Minister for the Environment, the Hon. Kevin Minson, has outlined his government's reasons for opposing the establishment of the NEPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, those reasons are as follows. Firstly, the effect of the bill is that the NEPC overrides the powers of the state environment minister and state cabinet, with the state parliament forfeiting its powers to disallow regulations. Secondly, uniform national standards are impractical because local solutions are required for reasons of regional diversity. Thirdly, the NEPC adds another level of administration which will only reduce international competitiveness. The NEPC will then be administratively inefficient and will duplicate state processes. The final reason is that the council will only add costs to existing consensus mechanisms, such as the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that the Commonwealth government has been unable to address adequately the concerns of the Western Australian government. I encourage the Commonwealth government to ensure that the spirit of the agreement is maintained and the process of Commonwealth-state cooperation is fostered. This may pave the way for Western Australia to become a party to the scheme at a later time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are measures contained in the bill which, it is acknowledged, go some way towards recognising the Western Australian government's concerns and reducing the likely effects predicted by the Western Australian government. In the first place, the council membership provision provides for each member to appoint a state representative. Secondly, the national environment protection measures will only apply to activities that are subject to Commonwealth law, or where the measures have been specifically implemented by the state or states. Thirdly, any decisions of the NEPC must have the support of at least two-thirds of the members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Western Australian government's remaining concerns, it is accepted that it is an aim of the council to achieve consistency rather than uniformity. The adjective `harmonious' has been bandied about as setting a standard which is distinctive from uniformity and, if that is a reality, it is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council is required to take account of regional variations, cost-effectiveness, social and economic impacts and other intergovernmental mechanisms. Another desirable cooperative federal-state feature is that the council secretariat is expected to consist of only a small staff with reliance being placed on state expertise to avoid duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am hopeful, but not confident, that the intention of the legislation and the mechanisms contained in it will, in time, prove sufficient to take account of state interests, as expressed in the original agreement. If that proves to be the case, then I would hope also&mdash;again I cannot pretend I am confident&mdash;that the Western Australian government, recognising it owes its first duty to the people of that state, in due course might join the scheme proposed under the bill. It would only then be a truly national and cooperative scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) is in a very difficult position on the National Environment Protection Council Bill. I am glad to see he supports it, but his party colleagues in Western Australia do not. I did not find his defence of them at all convincing. I understand that the objections that the Western Australian government has made to the National Environment Protection Council and its related policy include that the Western Australian government wants a review of the national greenhouse response strategy involving the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, which most countries of the world have now supported. Similarly, it wants to stop Australian ratification of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which, again, a large number of countries have now ratified, and it is not persuaded that national strategies on conservation matters should be finalised until the Commonwealth Environment Protection Authority has demonstrated that nationalisation of environmental issues brings increased efficiency on both environmental and economic matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could a national strategy not bring improved efficiency? There is constant complaint from the business sector about inconsistencies in environmental policies between the Commonwealth and the various states. Since the intention of the National Environment Protection Council is to try to reduce those differences, I would have thought it was very obvious that efficiency would be increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that the opposition is supporting this bill for a very good reason and that every other state and territory government has decided to support it, but it really does reflect very badly on the Western Australian government that its own extremist position on the environment prevents it from supporting what is an entirely reasonable bill. The minister who introduced this bill in the Senate, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), absolutely rightly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Environment Protection Council Bill is an important landmark in the history of environment protection in Australia. It marks the commitment of the Commonwealth and the states and territories to work cooperatively to develop national environment protection measures. These measures aim to give all Australians the benefit of equivalent environmental protection and to ensure that investment decisions by business are not distorted by variations in environmental standards between Australian jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA>That surely says it all. That is the purpose of the council. It outlines its tasks and those tasks are entirely in the interests both of the environment and of the business community because it will reduce inconsistencies in the way environmental policies are made between the states. Development like this has been crying out to be made for some years. I notice that the member for Tangney said that it was not before time that something of this kind was introduced. I agree with him, but that makes it all the more sad that his own party in Western Australia is not involved in supporting the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney outlined the purposes, composition, functions and mode of operation of the council so well that there is really no point in my repeating what he said. So all I really need to do is emphasise that this bill is a response to the difficulty that the Commonwealth has in developing environmental policy in the national interest in the situation where it has no direct environmental power. That is, of course, because the constitution was prepared in an age when people were not substantially aware of environmental matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has been able to achieve some standardisation of environmental policy by using other powers given to it: the external affairs power, in particular, and the trade and commerce power to some extent. But those are indirect influences so it is very important to build up as strongly as possible on a cooperative basis the relationships between the Commonwealth government and the state governments to ensure environmental protection and a proper balance between environmental protection and the needs of the economy and human society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the purpose of this bill. It will establish a council made up of ministers from the Commonwealth and state governments. It will be serviced by a very small secretariat. It will make policies relating to a whole series of issues which many Australians are very concerned about: issues such as air quality, water quality, noise, site contamination, problems associated with hazardous wastes, motor vehicle emissions and reuse and recycling of materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those are issues that a high proportion of Australians are really concerned about, and I am quite sure there would be overwhelming support in the community for this bill because people want those issues to be taken more seriously. They want firm clear guidelines set for them, and the establishment of this council will provide the institutional framework within which that can happen more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities of the council, as the member for Tangney repeated a couple of times, require it to take account of cost effectiveness in deciding what measures to adopt. They require it also to look at the social and economic impact as well as the environmental impact of decisions that are made and obligations under existing international treaties. The council is empowered to set standards, goals, guidelines or protocols, instruments with different levels of strength and power, and that gives it quite a degree of flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to note also that the bill encourages the council to seek public comment on what it proposes to do. That is something that will be welcomed because there is great interest in environmental matters in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I strongly support this bill. I welcome the fact that the government is presenting it and I strongly support the efforts of the government to achieve comprehensiveness in membership.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were looking at this National Environment Protection Council Bill in 1990 and 1991 I remember doing a lot of work with the then shadow environment minister, Fred Chaney, who was the honourable member for Pearce in Western Australia. It seems to me that the whole process has been a long time in its gestation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the things that we were talking about in those days are now in the bill. Some of the things that were raised at the time from the government's side, on which we counselled that some caution was required, have certainly been taken on board, as have concerns from other members of the broader community. I am pleased to see that the government has been responsive in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the National Environment Protection Council, pursuant to the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, signed by the Commonwealth government and all the state and territory governments and the president of the Local Government Association in 1992. It establishes the council's functions and powers. It is interesting that at the special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990, the question of implementation of a national environmental strategy involving the Commonwealth and states was discussed. Long overdue in my opinion, it was then acknowledged that all levels of government have different roles in the environment protection and management fields and that any agreement should outline those respective roles and responsibilities. The intergovernmental agreement on the environment, the IGAE, was signed subsequently on 1 May 1992. That agreement is contained in the schedule to this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of mechanisms outlined in that IGAE agreement. The IGAE sought a cooperative national approach to the environment; a better definition of the roles of respective governments; a reduction in the number of disputes between the Commonwealth and states and territories on environmental issues; greater certainty of government and business decision making; and better environmental protection. The IGAE also acknowledged the role of the respective tiers of government, and it recognised the trans-boundary nature of environmental concerns. In other words, in colloquial terms, when a bug goes from Victoria to New South Wales it does not recognise that the Murray might actually be a state boundary. It is quite right that we recognise the national nature of those things and, of course, the IGAE also recognises the need for ecologically sustainable development and the importance of sustainable land use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IGAE set out a number of broad principles of environmental policy: the precautionary principle, being broadly the careful consideration of the possibility of serious or irrevocable environmental damage; the preservation of inter-generational equity, in other words, the maintenance of the environment for future generations; conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity; and improved market mechanisms encompassing the consideration of environmental costs, the principle of polluter pays and the establishment of cost-effective environmental goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IGAE went on to talk about setting up an environmental protection authority&mdash;although this bill, in fact, sets up the protection council. It talked about the need for national environmental protection measures which might cover things such as ambient air quality, ambient marine and freshwater quality, noise related issues, guidelines for the assessment of site contamination, and environmental impacts associated  with hazardous wastes, motor vehicle emissions, and the re-use and recycling of materials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns mentioned by previous speakers is that, whilst this move is supported by the federal government, the opposition and the state governments around the country, there have been concerns articulated by the West Australian government. I understand that in May this year the Western Australian minister for the environment, the Hon. Kevin Minson, issued a paper entitled `The Proposed National Environment Protection Council (NEPC)&mdash;analysis and criticism of the concept by the government of Western Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper argued a number of things. In particular, it said that the NEPC was unnecessary because it would require state parliaments to forfeit their powers to disallow regulations, whilst allowing the Commonwealth to retain such powers in the area of pollution standards; that uniform national pollution standards are impractical because of the wide variety of Australian environments and their uses; that the NEPC would reduce competitiveness by introducing another  layer of centralised regulation; and also that the NEPC would tie up resources of pollution control agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that a response to a number of those concerns can be more than adequately dealt with. When making national environment protection measures, the NEPC will be required to take into account regional variations, and that is obviously commonsense. The NEPC will aim not for strict uniformity but rather for a consistent approach to environmental protection. The NEPC will be administratively efficient, I would hope. Certainly it is not large. Its secretariat has nine people or fewer and it will be sharing with the states expertise regarding environmental problems to make sure that it avoids duplication. I would have to say that avoidance of duplication is going to be a very critical test of this particular body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also seems that states with higher standards than those set by the NEPC will have the flexibility to retain those standards. Therefore there will be some pressure from the other states to get those states which have got minimum standards to raise their standards so that Australia as a nation&mdash;and I think all too often we do not think sufficiently about Australia as a nation&mdash;will be able to compete effectively in the wider world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill itself there are a number of objectives set out specifically. I think one should remind the committee of the two major objectives of the act. One is for people to enjoy the benefit of equivalent protection from air, water or soil pollution and from noise wherever they live in Australia. The other objective is that decisions of the business community are not distorted and markets are not fragmented by variations between participating jurisdictions in relation to the adoption or implementation of major environment protection measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that one of the difficulties for businesses operating in this country, and not only in the area of the environment but also in the areas of labelling regulations, safety regulations and many different areas, is that if you want to be a national company you have to comply with so many different rules. They are on a different basis in different states. There is a cost factor involved. There is a time factor involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about establishing some decent domestic critical mass for many of our companies and for the products they produce as a springboard to going overseas, which we all acknowledge is very important, then we ought to be looking to minimise some of those costs and to having consistent standards. I think this is a move in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we have already heard the membership of the council. There is the federal minister and also ministers from each of the states and from the Northern Territory. There is the need for a two-thirds majority before things can be adopted. It seems to me that that is a very substantial majority and should protect the interests of the smaller states which might feel threatened. It is also interesting to note that not only will we have regular reports to the parliament but also that after five years the whole process is going to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned some of the areas in which the council will take action. There is one important variation to the general theme of ambient air and water and so on. That concerns noise and emission standards relating to the design, construction and technical characteristics of new and in-service motor vehicles. Those standards that the council might be involved in have to be made in agreement with and in conjunction with the National Road Transport Commission and they must be determined in accordance with the National Road Transport Commission Act. So there are a number of safeguards in this legislation to make sure that we do not have the environment impinging unrealistically in areas that have wider implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national environment protection measures must each comprise one or more of the following. There must be a national environment protection standard, a protection goal, a protection guideline or protection protocol. The process is set out fairly comprehensively to make sure that central government does not run rampant in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that really remains for me to say is that what we have is a recognition by all Australian governments that environmental issues do not just recognise state borders. I am sorry that the Western Australian government is not able to come to the same view. I think a small national body to deal with those international aspects of environment and interstate issues and coordination is a very sensible move. There is clearly an intent to try to avoid duplication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly an intent to try to avoid duplication and I think the bureaucracy will have a heavy responsibility in that respect. I think there is not only a recognition of the importance of protecting the environment for today and for future generations but also an acknowledgment that economic factors must be realistically catered for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need a repetition, for example, of the Coronation Hill situation; we do not need to argue the rights and wrongs all over again of that particular decision. What happened there quite clearly was that political decisions got in the way of the economic and environmental decisions in the final analysis. Hopefully, the sort of legislation we are talking about this morning will get around those sorts of difficulties and will give industry some consistency in what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many areas of Australia, we tend to miss out as a nation because of fragmented rules and regulations, which often conflict, as I said before. I think this will go some way to help those concerns. The cost of not doing things in a coordinated way is enormous, in terms of both dollars and quality of life. It seems to me that the proof of the pudding is in the eating&mdash;in other words, in the way this legislation actually operates on a day-to-day basis. It is a sensible piece of legislation and it is deserving of the support of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This National Environment Protection Council Bill clearly reflects the lack of constitutional power that the Commonwealth has in environmental matters. Clearly, under the constitution the Commonwealth has no express power over the environment. In the past, the Commonwealth has intervened in environment matters in two ways: firstly, through cooperation with the states through agreements; and, secondly, through other heads of power&mdash;for example, corporations power or the external affairs power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of environmental protection generally, this has led to cooperation with the states with a lowest common denominator approach, with the states only agreeing to the lesser standards, sometimes to be embodied in uniform legislation. Unfortunately, the history of uniform legislation in Australia shows that very soon it becomes `un-uniform'. One of the states changes it and the whole impact of that uniformity is lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gets us away from this lowest common denominator approach by setting what are called national environment protection measures, NEPMs. Other speakers have set out the areas in which these measures are to be enforced. Nevertheless, I am going to talk about enforcement. The enforcement of these measures is to be achieved by appropriate mechanisms such as state and Commonwealth environmental protection authorities. This comes about by virtue of clause 17 of schedule 5 of the original agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. The schedule also obliges the states and the Commonwealth to draft legislation allowing the NEPA to establish NEPMs and to ensure enforcement of the NEPMs in the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about enforcement, because I think this is one of the crucial problems. To some extent, this bill is the last chance for Commonwealth-state cooperation in the area of the environment. As I have already stated, the Commonwealth has very limited powers in relation to the environment. However, this is not widely recognised in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the public also sees the environment and its preservation as a major concern. To digress, it is very clear that young people in Australia see the environment as important. Any surveys of young people show that they are very concerned about the environment. In schools in my electorate, young people say that their first concern in the general political area is the environment. This is not going to change. There is a great expectation from the Australian people that we should deliver in the area of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know this from market research carried out by ANOP, the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories and the ESD secretariat in 1991. This market research shows that a clear majority of Australians believe that the Commonwealth should have power to set national standards and enforce them: 73 per cent believe that the Commonwealth should set uniform standards for air and water pollution, 68 per cent believe we should protect plant and animal species, and 62 per cent believe we should set uniform standards for soil and land degradation. Only a minority of those surveyed, between 25 and 35 per cent on these issues, believe that such matters should be left to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming through the survey is a belief that the Commonwealth has more power than it really has in the area of environment protection. In my electorate these matters are a little bit more confused because of the presence of two World Heritage areas. Because the Commonwealth can act in World Heritage areas, there is an expectation that the Commonwealth can act in other areas. Quite often in Cairns something happens outside the World Heritage areas and I am called upon to do something, as is the federal Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), when quite clearly the Commonwealth has no constitutional power to act. This perception of extensive power, especially under World Heritage, has been promoted by the politicians of the right, not by the Labor government and not by the conservation movement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to digress a little bit and note that the same thing is being said today about native title. People are saying that native title will lock up all of Cape York Peninsula. It is very interesting that there is some analogy there. The same sort of nonsense that was peddled in the 1980s about the wet tropics is now being peddled about native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, there is a general perception in the community that the Commonwealth does have power in relation to environmental areas. If this cooperative approach does not work here, then the Commonwealth will have to consider other measures. This makes the attitude of governments like the Western Australian government vital to the success of this sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking following the original intergovernmental agreement on the environment in April 1992, which led to this legislation, the former minister, the member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), said the agreement had been very hard to negotiate, with some states reluctant to support it. This was before Western Australia pulled out. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it doesn't work, in my view we'll just have to go for some constitutional change in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with that statement by the member for Canberra. I believe that if this bill does not work&mdash;and that means if Western Australia does not get on board and the states do not cooperate&mdash;then there will have to be some response by the Commonwealth. Bearing in mind the degree of support in the community for constitutional change, I would not bet on it not getting through. Those people on the other side of the House who support states rights should be getting behind this bill in a big way, because it is probably the last chance for states rights in the environmental area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difficulty legally in relation to the enforcement of intergovernmental agreements, and the High Court has been quite reluctant in the past to see such agreements as enforceable. I set out the terms of the bill earlier and it certainly sets out a very strong regime for enforcement. If we are looking at further areas of constitutional reform, this is a significant problem and we need to talk about it. We do not want this process to break down. If we want the states to cooperate, we will have to provide a greater level of opportunity for the enforcement of agreements. If we do not, I guess the next step will be that the Commonwealth will legislate to give itself power over the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court has been very reluctant in the past to enforce such interstate agreements. The court says that they are not enforceable and that they give rise to political obligations rather than legal obligations. It is worth quoting Mr Justice McTiernan in the case of South Australia v. the Commonwealth in 1961. That case relates to the attempt to get some agreement for uniformity in legislation dealing with rail gauges in Australia. That is something that the rights of the state got in the way of as well. When talking about this sort of agreement Mr Justice McTiernan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not provide legal rights or obligations. It works as a matter of governmental policy. The promises on either side are of a political nature, and both parties would understand at the time the agreements were made, that this was the true nature of the promises. Their performance necessarily requires executive and further parliamentary action. It is a matter for the discretion of respective governments to take such action if and when they see fit to do so. It is not contemplated by either agreement that its performance could ever be made the subject of judicial order.</PARA>
<PARA>That of course relates to that matter raised in 1961. In relation to Mr Justice McTiernan's last sentence, I think it is true to say that this legislation attempts to give an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states some sort of enforceability, and that is the key to this legislation's working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation does not work, the first thing the Commonwealth should do is have a look at the position that the High Court takes to see whether we can get through, with the cooperation of the states, some sort of constitutional amendment that gives those sorts of agreements enforceability. If we cannot get to that position, I think the Commonwealth will have to start thinking about public opinion in relation to the environment and how it is going to exercise its proper power. From time to time we cop criticism from the public for our actions on the environment but we really do not have the power to do anything. In the long run that is probably going to be an untenable political situation for any Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is of concern that the Western Australian government has not come on board in terms of this legislation. If the public want national legislation, that means national legislation and it does not exclude Western Australia. Of course that does not mean that the people of Western Australia do not expect the Commonwealth government and the Western Australian government to endorse environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been reading an excellent book by Phillip Toyne, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Reluctant Nation</EMPHASIS>, in which he very clearly sets out the problems that have occurred in the past with respect to Commonwealth-state relations on the environment. He also says that those arrangements have probably, in some ways, been successful through the use of the external affairs power but that they have sometimes failed the public's expectation in relation to the environment. Phillip Toyne is very critical of the approach of this bill. He does not hold out a lot of optimism for this agreement and this bill to be successful. Again, I guess one of the problems is the enforceability of the rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I totally support this legislation because we have got to go through this step. We have got to give the states a chance to come to the party and we have got to give the states a chance to fulfil their obligations. Phillip Toyne very clearly sets out the difficulties and the limitations that have occurred in our approach in the past. To be fair to him, he would say that some of the problems have been of a political nature rather than of a constitutional nature. In another part of the book Mr Toyne quotes the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We give the impression to the world at large that we see the defence, in an absolute sense of some extreme version of States' Rights, as being important itself . . . as we come to a centenary of Federation (it is important) that Governments of every persuasion, in a very open way, are prepared to address some of these shibboleths, some of these sacred cows that both sides of politics have in their own ways held to be sacred for so long and that have held back the progress of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>Now that is not some mad left-winger from the Labor Party. That is a quotation about the Liberal Party from the then Premier of New South Wales, Nick Greiner. So Nick Greiner recognises that states rights are often getting in the way of national objectives. That is what Phillip Toyne is talking about in this book and that is what I hope this legislation recognises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I endorse the appointment of Mr Toyne as Deputy Secretary to the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. That is an excellent appointment. It is an appointment that the department itself has made. I think that Mr Toyne will be an excellent addition to the Commonwealth bureaucracy, if I might use that word, because of his very broad experience both as a lawyer working in the Northern Territory for Aboriginal rights and also as someone who is part of the conservation movement. The Commonwealth department will be very much enhanced by his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the very short time that I have left, I will talk about a local issue which highlights some of these problems about Commonwealth-state relations. That is the question of the development at Hinchinbrook, which has been the cause of some controversy, certainly in the part of the world that I come from, and it obviously has some sort of national significance. Again, I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating not only the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the member for Canberra, but also the present Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, because I think he has handled these very difficult issues of Commonwealth-state relations in the area of the environment with great aplomb.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of Hinchinbrook, I put on the record that I totally support his approach in relation to the matter&mdash;that is, that it is very important in relation to the Great Barrier Reef to uphold World Heritage values. Senator Faulkner has insisted on a baseline study on the effect the proposed development on Hinchinbrook would have on the Hinchinbrook Channel and development at Cardwell; and I certainly support that action. Obviously when the Commonwealth has the information in relation to the baseline study, then the Commonwealth can make a proper assessment about the effect the marina part of the development, at least, would have on the Great Barrier Reef, one of the World Heritage areas. I totally support Senator Faulkner in that stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the situation is very illustrative of the crazy situation we have in this country in relation to the environment and Commonwealth-state relations. I am not even saying in this speech whether the Commonwealth should do something about it, because we have got to see the end of the baseline study. However, the Commonwealth can do something about the channel but it cannot do anything about what is on the land. It has no power to assess what is on the land. If the proverbial man from Mars came to Australia and looked at that situation, he would go away thinking we were crazy because somehow the Commonwealth has the power for water but not for land. That is the situation that we have got in this country today because of so-called states rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the public demands a better approach. I am not suggesting the Hinchinbrook development should not go ahead or that it should go ahead&mdash;I am not saying that in this contribution to the debate. What I am saying is that, if we are to have proper decision making in this country, it should not be of that nature&mdash;that the state government makes an announcement in relation to a development. The Commonwealth role is very clear: the Commonwealth has an obligation to look after World Heritage areas. That is why Senator Faulkner has fulfilled his duties to perfection because he has fulfilled the Commonwealth's obligation. Yet to all intents and purposes, the development has been given the go-ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, if we do not refine our arrangements for Commonwealth-state cooperation so that we do not get that sort of situation in the future, we are going to have to look towards some sort of constitutional change. If conservative forces line up against that they may find themselves on the losing side. I emphasise the overwhelming public support in the community for preservation of the environment. That is something that people see as very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I totally support this legislation. I implore honourable members on the other side to talk to the Court government, saying that this is the last chance for cooperation in the area of the environment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Environment Protection Council Bill establishes the National Environment Protection Council, which aims to introduce a cooperative national approach to the environment. The Commonwealth currently does not have any express power in relation to the environment, but the establishment of this council will help all tiers of government in Australia to develop a national environmental strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most environment issues, for example water or air pollution, do not discriminate against state boundaries so it makes sense to have a national council such as this. The Premiers Conference, in 1990, raised the issue of implementation of a national environment strategy to help governments avoid conflicts on environmental decision making. The three tiers of government signed the intergovernmental agreement on the environment in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition initially had concerns with the National Environment Protection Council, as we feared it would mean another layer of bureaucracy and further centralisation of power in Canberra. However, the council will be made up of a representative of each state as well as a federal representative and it will have a secretariat with a maximum of nine staff. The council will also be required to take into account regional variations. From past rhetoric, however, regional representation from the federal government does not imbue me with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When established, the National Environment Protection Council will be responsible for national environment protection measures which will look at air and water quality, noise, hazardous waste, site contamination, motor vehicle emissions and recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the aims of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, which I mentioned earlier, was the protection of the environment for future generations. The issue of environmental sustainability cannot be treated lightly nor can it be dealt with by platitudes and rhetoric. However, at times the federal government treats the environment debate in just this way. Going on the experience of my own electorate, I would say that many times the government is more intent on national publicity campaigns which attempt to capture the imagination of peak lobby groups, rather than on-the-ground work with our environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list a few of the issues which are electorate specific. The first is the World Heritage listing of Lake Eyre. That has been a long-running issue, yet not until very recent weeks have the local people even been consulted. A meeting took place in Birdsville last year. I understand that the then federal minister (Mrs Kelly) actually flew over Birdsville but could not land to spend even half an hour with the quite big gathering there. Those people felt at the time and still feel that they are fighting for their very livelihoods&mdash;in that region, that means their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue is the management of nuclear waste sites throughout Australia such as the one in my electorate. The decision was taken, despite all the rhetoric. I was quite happy with the process&mdash;the way the public consultation was going&mdash;but then those sites were announced in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> without any consultation with any of the people on the ground. A few weeks later, because of a court decision in New South Wales, we have the convenient dumping&mdash;admittedly of low-level nuclear waste&mdash;in Woomera, because that is a convenient site. Once again, this occurred with very little consultation. Once again, it is said that it will be there for only a short period; it is certainly not a permanent site. But it is indicative of the importance of balancing the centralist power with a respect for people in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have had some involvement with the environmental movement. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), spoke of Phillip Toyne. A few years ago I worked with Phillip on the land care issue. Generally speaking, it was a reasonably harmonious relationship. Obviously, there are tensions. From my position, coming from the land, it was difficult to reconcile the bigger picture issues of taxation on the land, the economic issues, with the need and the respect that the overwhelming number within my regional community had for the issue of land care and the importance of doing something about it. But we got through that period, and I acknowledge Phillip Toyne's role in it, along with that of Rick Farley, who addressed, with the government of the day, a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this day, the great unfinished business is the matter of the economic policies which put so much pressure on our land. I call it our great national schizophrenia, in the sense that we want all the good things from the land in the way that we tax it, in the way we distribute the wealth, but we are not prepared to acknowledge that the overwhelming number of people who are working the land basically are battling to make decent social welfare payments. Even before an operator on the land&mdash;who after all has the land at heart&mdash;can get a living wage, he pays something like 30 or 40 per cent of his costs straight into the national Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I come back to my theme of the national schizophrenia of land care. For all the wonderful power that we think we might have in this place as legislators&mdash;many of us lawyers who have an understanding of the law&mdash;legislators and lawyers do not actually plant trees unless they physically go out and do it. So people with the encouragement and the incentive to go out and do practical things are needed. That is something I would implore the federal government to always consider: the practical reality of getting as many people as possible on side through practical incentives to improve this environment of ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue I want to discuss in this matter of the environment&mdash;and I want to try to come from a practical point of view&mdash;is the rabbit. It is a fairly mundane subject to many, I suppose. There are estimated to be about 300 million rabbits in Australia. The cost to agriculture from rabbit damage in Australia is about $90 million. I do not think we have to talk long to convince people about the effect on soil erosion and the general effect on the regeneration of native vegetation. In this one simple example I want to try to explain to particularly the urban population that if land care is one of our most profound environmental issues, and if the rabbit is one of the most destructive components of it, surely it is reasonable that in our policies we give far greater consideration to this issue. As one leading environmental magazine commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems reasonable to ask why we are not controlling&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>our rabbits&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">more effectively. The rabbits are winning; we and the ecosystems are losing. Why? Because of the priorities for spending money. The 1990s is the decade of tree planting. Our Prime Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the day&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">announced that we would plant one billion trees before the year 2000. The PM and his advisers are demonstrably ignorant of the problems of the semi-arid 70% of this continent.</PARA>
<PARA>That comment is from someone outside my philosophy or certainly outside my expertise. That person is making the general comment that we really need to focus on much more of the practical in our dealing with the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention was made of the rail industry. I would be the first to agree that it was sheer folly the way we organised our rail industry in the last century. I think we have moved on a little bit since the rail industry. We do have telephones; we do have faxes; we do have a whole range of what I think most of us would agree is a remarkable array of technology for communicating. There would be those who would say we might even be able to do away with this place and simply communicate by modern technology. So things have changed. There is no excuse for not offering reasonable communication from Commonwealth to state to local. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the defence of the Western Australian government&mdash;and I am not here as an apologist for those in the Western Australian government; they are quite capable of defending themselves&mdash;I do recall a comment by Richard Court, the Premier, in the native title discussion where he was, in his opinion, deliberately sidelined for political purposes. I want to bring in Phillip Toyne's point about the way politics always has its hand there; however heavy or however hidden or whatever, the fundamental of politics is always there. Richard Court felt very strongly that in the native title issue he was deliberately sidelined. He felt that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and those from the government were deliberately setting him up to play the political game. I will let that rest there but I think Phillip Toyne might have a point about the way that politics is played and the way that politics has come in to this whole environmental debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, no-one is going to deny that we have a responsibility to future generations for the environment. No responsible government&mdash;national, state or local&mdash;will deny that there is a very strong responsibility to the centuries ahead. We have made quite remarkable progress in many ways. We have the tools at hand to do a lot better than we have. We are suffering from too much rhetoric and too much appealing to lobby groups rather than appealing to the general population and offering incentives where we can get on top of a lot of environmental issues in a much more practical way. We have this issue of World Heritage listing which is going to be played, I have no doubt, for every inch of political mileage that the government can get out of it. We have the Murray-Darling system which is crying out for a cooperative settlement of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was pleasing the other day to see the South Australian state government and the Prime Minister put money into the tin to clean up the Patawalonga. It was very pleasing. It is possible to have sensible Commonwealth-state resolutions of environmental issues. If there is a willingness to tackle these issues in goodwill, it is not necessary, as some from the government would say, to abolish the states and have this heavy-handed constitutional power. If the Commonwealth insists on playing politics for every inch of political mileage, these issues will arise from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the capacity at hand to solve these issues, and I hope that the federal government will maximise those opportunities. I am sure the opposition will always be there, supporting wherever it is practical and reasonable and wherever regions feel vulnerable to external powers and to the power of the federal government. There are regions which feel very isolated in this debate, and I make no secret of this: the people of the Lake Eyre Basin feel particularly isolated and particularly vulnerable after many generations of living there. I ask what right any federal government has to put them out of business. With those few words, I conclude my comments. The coalition does not oppose this bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the issues that the council will address are air quality, marine and estuarine fresh water quality, noise protection, general guidelines for the assessment of site contamination, motor vehicle emissions, and re-use and recycling of materials. All of these issues affect not only eastern Australia but also Western Australia, and of course there are no boundaries to them: they are everyone's problem. The huge cost of rectifying some of these environmental problems requires that the federal government must be involved in determining the best way to resolve the issues at hand and to make certain that the answer is applicable to every state and territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to address a couple of areas where the National Environment Protection Council could be very effective. Australia is one of only two countries in the world to allow the dumping of toxic or radioactive waste into the sea. The Tasmanian government and the Australian government allow Pasminco to dump 240,000 tonnes of toxic sludge per year into the sea off Tasmania. Australia is also one of seven wealthy nations currently dumping plastics, metal sludge, lead batteries and other waste in South-East Asia. For example, in the months of September to December 1993, New South Wales exported 63,000 tonnes of lead battery waste to the Philippines. We are exporting our waste, and this is the sort of thing that the new body should be looking at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of marine pollution, 58 million tonnes of ballast water from foreign ships is discharged annually into our waters. I repeat: 58 million tonnes&mdash;a huge amount of water. With this water come all sorts of problems, all types of organisms, such as starfish and&mdash;recently&mdash;giant worms. These worms are in Port Phillip Bay. I do not think they are in the area of the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), but they could be coming up the Maribyrnong Creek very quickly. These giant, spaghetti-like worms are threatening marine life in Melbourne's Port Phillip Bay. They have also been discovered in Western Australia, potentially jeopardising some of the nation's richest fisheries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have two completely different areas: one on the east coast and one on the west coast. Of course, Western Australia does not want to get involved in this, but there are also giant worms over there. These 50 centimetre worms, believed to have been introduced from the Mediterranean by foreign ships discharging ballast waters, were detected this week in Cockburn Sound near Perth and scientists warned yesterday they may have spread as far north as the fishing grounds off Carnarvon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national study is under way amid fears that these worms may have moved up the eastern seaboard from Port Phillip Bay where there is already a huge colony of these worms, covering an area of 500 square kilometres. This is the sort of thing that this protection council must address. It is a national issue that is becoming bigger and bigger. It is also a perfect example of the need for this body to oversee what is a national problem. If this body is to work, it must have the cooperation of all of the states. That is why I am very disappointed that Western Australia has not agreed to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was elected in March of 1983&mdash;a great year, I can assure you&mdash;the first words I uttered in this House were in the form of a question to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment inform the House of the Government's attitude to using the external powers contained in section 51 (xxix) of the Constitution to protect the world heritage property in South West Tasmania.

<PARA>This is a question that I asked back in 1983 but it is exactly what we are talking about today&mdash;the states' rights. My question at that time related of course to the Franklin River and the problems that were being experienced down there. There was bipartisan support for that at that time. The Fraser government had come out and said that it would not build the Franklin Dam. Of course, it was all a bit late for the Fraser government because it lost on that issue in the election campaign. The Tasmanian government at the time did not agree with that statement but we all know what happened: the dam was not built. Even today, as I will demonstrate to you later, there are huge numbers of people travelling down to Tasmania to see not a dam but a free running river. I trust that I will not have to ask that sort of question in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking of Tasmania also gives me the opportunity to raise another issue of national importance that is about to take off. I am talking about the restoration of beautiful Lake Pedder. A campaign has already started, and it has the support of many people from all over the world, ranging from Prince Phillip to Dick Smith. They are quite different people but they have supported what is called `pulling the plug on Lake Pedder.' I think this is the first time that this issue has been raised in the House and I intend to campaign very strongly to make certain that Lake Pedder is restored to its former pristine beauty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give members a little of the history of what happened there. The Tasmanian government began flooding Lake Pedder as part of the Gordon River power development scheme in 1972. This action was taken despite a substantial body of scientific evidence and public opinion that Lake Pedder was an area of significant long-term scientific value. Lake Pedder had been declared a national park in 1955, in recognition of the area's rugged natural beauty and its significant and aesthetic recreational values. There was a huge public outcry at the time of the flooding, with public protest meetings. There was also a petition with over 10,000 signatures and an avalanche of comment in the Tasmanian media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission investigated a number of alternative schemes which avoided flooding Lake Pedder and an interim report by the Lake Pedder committee of inquiry recommended that the Australian government provide finance to allow a moratorium on further flooding. At that time, even the people of Tasmania were looking for some sort of direction from the Commonwealth government to try to stop the flooding of Lake Pedder. However, we know what happened. It has been flooded. I think everyone now recognises that it was a mistake to flood this beautiful area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are studies now that suggest that not only would the hydro-electric power generated as a result of the flooding not be missed but also that there would be a substantial increase in tourism revenue. Tourism spending would increase by an estimated $24 million and about 600 jobs would be created if Lake Pedder were restored to its pre-dam condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More significantly, Tasmania has a power glut of about 130 megawatts. Lake Pedder generates only 65 megawatts. The Comalco smelter is at Bell Bay and the talk is that it will close in 1998. If this happens, the excess power being generated in Tasmania could be 300 megawatts, with nowhere for it to go. If that Bass link were connected to the Victorian or the national power grid, there would then be somewhere for it to go; however, that is pie in the sky. That is also an area where the federal government and the new body could be involved to determine whether that would be something that was in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is possible, I believe, to rectify what has happened in Lake Pedder. If this were done, it would be of enormous benefit to the people of Australia and the world. It would be a simple matter to `pull the plug'. I believe there is a valve that cuts off the river flow into Lake Pedder, and using it is all that would be required to stop the lake from being filled. Then it could be drained by removing one small dam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to restore Lake Pedder, it would demonstrate to the world that we are leaders in environmental restoration. The symbolism of this action would bring a huge benefit to Tasmania. It would bring it by way of tourists; it would bring it by way of training people on environmental restoration. Let us imagine the work that would have to be involved in restoring just where the water line has eroded. It would be something that we could show to the world as a symbol that this nation is prepared to remove a development which is no longer necessary and turn it back to nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is believed that the sands on the bottom of the dam are covered with about two or three millimetres of sediment and they would be revealed by rain, et cetera, in less than five or six years.

People would come from all over the world to see this restoration of this huge area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, on his basic thesis in relation to Lake Pedder, I find it surprising that somebody espousing environmental considerations would suggest that a hydro-power generation operation be removed from the Tasmanian system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the emergence of the environment on the Australian political agenda the Commonwealth government has no explicit constitutional authority to legislate with respect to environmental matters. In the past the government has sidestepped this complication by legislating under different heads of power, such as the external affairs power, especially in relation to World Heritage listing, and the trade and commerce power. The Commonwealth is also empowered under section 96 of the constitution to make grants to the states on any terms it deems fit, which has also proved to be a means for the Commonwealth to procure the environmental outcomes it wishes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new federalism deal, which motivated the special Premiers Conference in Brisbane in October 1990, resolved that there was a need for different levels of government in Australia to formulate a new approach to decision making. Few would disagree in principle with the conclusions of that body when it pointed to a commitment to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The better definition of the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the states and territories with regard to environmental policy formation and implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>This statement acknowledges the different roles to be played by the different tiers of government. The next step in this process has been the intergovernmental agreement on the environment in May 1992 which agreed to the establishment of a ministerial council empowered to give effect to the national environmental protection measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are to cover the areas of air, water quality, noise, site contamination&mdash;I notice the member for Dunkley mentioned the battery export, and I have some sympathy with that problem&mdash;hazardous wastes, motor vehicle emissions and recycling of materials. Many such categories adopted will undoubtedly fall into categories over which the Commonwealth is not constitutionally empowered to legislate. This is the real difficulty that this legislation has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the NEPC provides the Commonwealth with a role in determining national standards for the environment. However, the states retain much of their control. The decisions of the NEPC require a two-thirds majority of the members. The membership is to consist of a minister from each state and one from the Commonwealth who chairs the council. Complementary legislation must be passed by all state governments in order to breathe life into the NEPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far only Western Australia has stated its intention to oppose this development. I agree with the member for Dunkley that it is unfortunate that the Western Australian government has seen fit not to participate in this complementary legislation. Each national environment protection measure will remain a state concern but will, in part, be dictated by whatever agreements the ministerial council has come to. States will be at liberty to pass more stringent standards than those set down by NEPC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, as a defender of the federal constitutional system, it is pleasing to see the government following a cooperative model in seeking to promote national policy in the environmental area. Clearly some environmental concerns cross over state boundaries and require a coordinated approach. The NEPC is arguably a response to this. Nevertheless, we should perpetually be harking back to the words that came out of the special Premiers Conference on this issue in 1990 when it was said that the aim of the new environmental approach was to better define the respective roles of the different tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean that we should be concentrating power in the hands of the national ministerial council on all environmental matters. It rather means that we must be careful to determine which environmental issues really are those which cross over state borders and thus require coordinated national attention, and which are best attended to by local and state authorities with their more intimate knowledge, expertise and experience in local issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It raises the fundamental issue of who controls environmental matters, whether it be the local authority, the local councils, the state government or, de facto, the federal government. Who really sets the standards? In my home state of Victoria it is the EPA that sets standards of environmental pollution and gauges what is acceptable at any particular time. I notice that the EPA changes its standard levels from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, environmental issues are moving up the political agenda at a federal level. The electorate is now more concerned about environmental matters. Whilst the Commonwealth does not have direct control, this legislation reflects the movement of environmental and other associated matters into the federal political arena and the attempts of the federal government and the opposition to deal with that movement of political awareness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now deal with the matters of salinity, water quality,  sewage outfalls and coastal management, which reflect this range of control by various authorities. All Australians and all members of this House should be concerned by the gradual encroachment of salinity across dry land in Western Australia, even in southern Victoria and through New South Wales and Queensland. We have very little capacity to control the movement of this dry land salinity as it moves across the landscape, and very careful educational programs, both with farmers and land users, need to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took an aeroplane trip over western Victoria and certain parts of western Victoria, in parts of the electorate of Corangamite, in areas where people would think that salinity would not be a problem, it was fairly obvious that there was a creeping salinity problem in those farming areas where improved pasture had been the order of the day, but high stocking rates, a removal of natural vegetation and a change in the environment had allowed salinity to creep&mdash;and that is the word, `creep'&mdash;forward in its encroachment on good farming land. And, if it is happening in western Victoria, let me assure the House that it is happening in very large doses in Western Australia and other more sparsely vegetated parts of Australia. Obviously people have views about the planting of trees to take the pressure off salinity. I think that is one solution. The application of different pasture species and generally revegetating the landscape are two approaches to overcoming the dry land salinity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The irrigation water table salinity is a matter that concerns every member of this House. The solution to that problem is a little bit more complex. All the irrigation programs around Australia are subject to this increasing salinity problem, both in the river systems and, of course, in the outflow and the build-up in the water table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter which helps to demonstrate the necessity for this bill is the situation in the Murray-Darling Basin, which covers so much of central Australia. The basin and catchment areas extend over 14 per cent of the Australian continent. This includes 75 per cent of the state of New South Wales as well as parts of Victoria, Queensland and South Australia, with a population of around two million people across these four states. It contributes a third of Australia's rural output, and it also contains about 75 per cent of irrigated land. It is suggested that it produces about $10 billion of primary produce annually, almost $1 billion from cotton. There are about 16,000 kilometres of rivers in the system and about 10 million megalitres are diverted for irrigation, about 20 times the volume of Sydney Harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures indicate the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin and the necessity to get a cooperative approach between the various states and the Commonwealth to handle the problems that I have been alluding to. The difficulty lies in monitoring the salinity levels in that river system and keeping a very watchful eye on the blue-green algae blooms that have emerged in recent times, I would suggest especially in the last two or three years when the river flow has been a lot less because of the drought. The lack of movement in the river will, I think, further increase the blue-green algae and is something that we will need to be very careful about. So it is important that the states cooperate at the federal level. The question always raised, of course, is where does the money come from to ensure that these cooperative regulatory measures, in some cases, and also corrective measures might take place in that particular basin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the sewerage systems of Australia in the urban regions, again these have moved up the political scale as a matter of environmental concern. I think Sydney led the way in increasing public consciousness about sewerage systems and ocean outfalls. In my home state of Victoria, the problems that the Sydney sewerage system had were always referred to in any public or private debate, and certainly the bad publicity surrounding that particular system, the inadequacy of the ancient system and the way in which it flowed into the ocean outfalls was an example to the rest of Australia of how not to do it. In Victoria certainly the political debate was raised a few notches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Environment Protection Authority in that state changed the criteria for ocean outfalls and in my own electorate of Corangamite the Black Rock sewage outfall for Geelong was very much a part of a major argument as to the quality of the sewage outfall that moved into the Southern Ocean, acceptable in the 1980s but unacceptable in the 1990s and requiring another $30 million of expenditure to improve the quality and refinement of the sewage that moved into the ocean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further ocean outfalls along the southern coast at Anglesea, Lorne and Apollo Bay indicate the national significance of maintaining high quality sewage outfalls into the ocean which I think would be reflected in other parts of the Australian coastline. The key question is: should it be a state responsibility or should it be a federal coordinated responsibility to ensure the quality of the environment around the coastlines?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just refer to the coastal management issue which has been referred to in this chamber on previous occasions. The really big question in Victoria and I guess around the Australian coastline is: who actually controls and manages the coastline around Australia? Is it historically the caravan park management which controls a section of the coastline? This is the situation in the electorate of Corangamite where more profitable caravan parks generate moneys which help foreshore committees maintain sections of the coastline. Is it a responsibility of local government? Is it a responsibility of the state government to coordinate coastal management or should the federal government provide some broad guidelines as to what should happen around the total Australian coastline?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Mark Birrell, Minister for Conservation and Environment in Victoria, who has instituted a management plan for the coastal areas from Lakes Entrance to Portland. There are various kinds of existing arrangements with foreshore committees, local councils, state governments and so on. At long last there is a coordinated approach to see what would be best for the environment, what would be best in terms of the land ownership and what would be best in the longer term, for example, how we might preserve that wonderful ocean road that moves through the southern part of my electorate which attracts so many tourists over time. That really raises these issues: what should federal governments be doing; what should state governments be doing in terms of a legislative arrangement; and should this legislation in a cooperative way allow local authorities to do what they do best at the local level?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just make a comment in relation to the control of forestry operations. This is really the responsibility of states and yet federal legislation, through the export licensing of woodchips, is able to maintain considerable control over forestry operations. Likewise, the implementation of the national heritage listing of forest areas, especially in Tasmania and Victoria, allows the Commonwealth to override the views of state governments and state forestry commissions in terms of how they might operate their forest areas. </PARA>

This government and the current minister have been using these powers very much to control forestry operations, particularly in Tasmania and in the south-east forest area.

I would certainly support a referendum to amend the constitution to enable the federal government to deal with environmental matters. As the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) has indicated, many if not most of those matters extend beyond state boundaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to address one of the main areas relevant to the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council and the particular focus that the legislation has&mdash;namely, the development of uniform national standards. That main area is the matter of air pollution and motor vehicle emissions. This is a matter that is of particular concern in my electorate because of the nature of my electorate, but it is also of concern to many electorates across the country. The basic problem we have with vehicle emissions is that roughly 65 to 75 per cent of our total air pollution problem is attributable to emissions from motor vehicles. I will take some time to run through the basic details of the emissions that cause problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there is the problem of particulates, which are known to exacerbate asthma and a variety of other respiratory complaints and diseases, to cause certain forms of cancer and, ultimately, to contribute to premature death. Compounds such as nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and ozone can exacerbate emphysema, asthma and bronchitis. Carcinogens such as benzene, toluene and a variety of other compounds can cause cancers such as leukaemia and lymphoma. Roughly 90 per cent of the benzene in the atmosphere comes from motor vehicles. There is no known safe level of exposure to benzene in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and perhaps most commonly known, is the problem of lead in the atmosphere. Roughly 90 per cent of the lead in the atmosphere also comes from motor vehicle emissions. Lead is known to threaten the intelligence level of young children and has a variety of other effects on such things as the renal, nervous, circulatory and reproductive systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a very brief snapshot of the types of problems that motor vehicle emissions cause, most obviously, of course, for urban dwellers and particularly for those in inner urban areas. The area that I represent in Melbourne is a classic example of an area that suffers from these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A landmark study was recently released. That United States study, which covered 16 years, is called the `Six Cities Study'&mdash;as opposed to `sick cities'. It was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New England Journal of Medicine</EMPHASIS> in December 1993. The study was conducted by eight eminent medical researchers. The study looked at the health effects of air pollution over a long period of time on people living in six different United States cities, each with different levels of air pollution problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study looked comprehensively at 811 people over 16 years. The conclusion that the study reached was that people in the most polluted city, the city with the highest level of particulates in the atmosphere, had a 26 per cent higher risk of premature death than those in the least polluted city. The study demonstrated a clear correlation between the presence of particulates in the atmosphere and the risk of premature death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study concluded that for every 10 micrograms of particulates per cubic metre of air, for every increase of 10 micrograms of particles that are smaller than 10 microns, the death rate in the community increases by one per cent. Those statistics are a bit mind numbing because they deal with measures that we are not normally accustomed to, unless we have a scientific background, but I think it is something worth noting. What they are saying is that particulates in the atmosphere, which predominantly come from motor vehicle emissions, cause people to die earlier than they otherwise would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recent research in Melbourne has shown that in areas near major freeways such as the south-eastern arterial and even some main roads, the level of particulates in the atmosphere sometimes reaches 60 to 70 micrograms per cubic metre, which is way above the standard of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, which, in turn, according to the six cities study, is itself above the safe level at which particulates are acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six cities study in effect showed that the level at which premature deaths can be expected to occur as a result of particulates in the atmosphere is, in fact, significantly below what the US EPA currently defines as a safe level. As a result of this, the United States Lung Association is taking legal proceedings in the United States against the EPA to endeavour to force it to try to tighten up the standard. In fact, the standard is three times higher than the level at which the study found that premature deaths began. As a result of the study, it was estimated that particulate emissions from motor vehicles probably account for somewhere in the vicinity of 60,000 premature deaths per year in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, extrapolatory figures of that nature are always vulnerable to some degree of fluctuation. They are an estimate; the figure may not be 60,000. However, the most obvious point is that, even if it is only 30,000 or 20,000, it is still an awful lot of people in the United States dying prematurely as a result of this one particular form of motor vehicle pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimate that was made on the same basis for Australia was that we can assume that somewhere around 800 people in Sydney and roughly 400 in Melbourne die prematurely each year as a result of particulate emissions. Again, even if it is not 400 in Melbourne, even if it is only 300, that is still roughly about the number of people who die in industrial accidents in Victoria each year. It is a very serious and significant problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another study that was conducted in Melbourne recently by Dr Michael Abramson of the Monash University Department of Social and Preventative Medicine indicated that, over a period of four years, roughly 20 per cent of asthma attack victims admitted to hospital in Victoria were admitted for attacks that were triggered by air pollution. Air pollution levels that caused asthma attacks accounted for 20 per cent of total asthma attacks in that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the C3 freeway, now called the south-eastern arterial, was built in Victoria in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, no study was done about the likely impact of particulate levels in the atmosphere. As I indicated, we have already got levels way above the safety limits. By the look of it, we are soon to repeat that mistake because of the enthusiasm in many parts of government and the bureaucracy to build the western and southern bypasses and to extend the eastern freeway in Melbourne. It is noteworthy that Dr Jonathan Streeton, a respiratory specialist from Melbourne who was commissioned to do a study on the particulates issue with respect to these proposals, had his report ultimately not incorporated in the environment effects statement with respect to those two bypass projects and we can perhaps speculate as to why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other vehicle emission pollutant problems to which we need to give consideration. Obviously, lead is one of them. The nitrogen dioxide levels that are now being tested around areas like the south-eastern arterial in Melbourne are already exceeding the safety limits and, given the likely expansion and usage of that freeway, particularly if the southern bypass goes ahead, we can only expect them to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, I have only referred to one particular aspect of the problem of vehicle emissions and that is premature death and health effects, which I think are very clearly established. As well as these things, we need to take into account work absenteeism&mdash;which, at its most basic, is a consequence of asthma and other respiratory problems that I referred to&mdash;and loss of productivity and property damage, estimated to run into billions of dollars every year as a result of air pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can ask the question: what is the federal government doing about these things? Certainly the establishment of the National Environment Protection Council is a significant step forward. It is one small step towards gradually converting our horse and buggy constitutional structure into something that is relevant to the end of the 20th century and beyond, but there are a lot more things that need to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision last year to set a different price for leaded petrol, so that it is higher than for unleaded petrol&mdash;a decision for which the federal government was criticised very severely by many parts of the community, including many backbenchers within its own ranks&mdash;has been a significant step forward. I am proud to be part of the government that did that. I supported the initiative and will continue to support it. I applaud the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) for her willingness to take on the very powerful forces in the community on that issue, and to stick with doing it. Ultimately, what we are talking about there is the health, particularly, of young children and their ability to develop their intellectual capacities fully, free of the threat of unduly high levels of lead in their bloodstream as a result of vehicle emissions. That is one major step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in other areas we still have vehicle emission standards that are a joke. Our current standards with respect to vehicle emissions from petrol driven vehicles are the same as those established in the United States in 1975. Next year we are going to strengthen them&mdash;but only to the level that the United States adopted in the mid-1980s; we will still be well behind the United States&mdash;and we will introduce standards with respect to emissions from diesel driven vehicles for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japanese truck manufacturers are pressuring the government to accept lower controls than those which now apply in the United States, presumably in order to be able to continue exporting vehicles to Australia which do not comply with United States controls. The Australian vehicle industry, with, I suspect&mdash;I have to have this confirmed&mdash;support from some of the unions involved, has lobbied the government not to adopt the standards that are now in place in the United States because to do so would increase the cost of manufacturing vehicles in Australia and make our vehicle manufacturing industry less competitive and therefore more vulnerable to overseas competition. That I find extremely disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a lot to do with the vehicle industry previously, as a trade union official. I well know its difficulties and I have been a strong supporter of retaining and expanding the Australian vehicle manufacturing industry. But I am not an uncritical supporter. I am not blind to the broader issues. If the price we are going to have to pay as a community, to ensure that that industry remains as it is, is for people to be dying prematurely as a result of vehicle emissions from substandard vehicles, that is a price that is too high. There are other ways of our ensuring as a community that the vehicle industry can remain in its current form instead of ultimately shifting the cost onto people with respiratory illnesses and people in the community who are more vulnerable to the consequences of things like particulate pollution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this illustrates is that in this country we have a huge blind spot in the public arena on transport issues. In effect, most of the people in public life in this country are obsessed in some form or other with roads, with cars and trucks. We say that public transport is heavily subsidised&mdash;$1,000 million a year or whatever it is in Victoria and the like&mdash;but we never look at the subsidy to road transport, perhaps because it is not quite as obvious, not being written up as a budget item in state budgets and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the pollution costs, which are in the billions; the road trauma costs, which are estimated at around $5 billion a year for Australia; the congestion costs; the health costs; and the land use costs. Let us think of the land, the prime real estate, that is used in places like Melbourne and Sydney for the purposes of freeways and major roads and imagine the value of that land if used for other purposes. It would be enormous. Obviously, there are enormous benefits from road transport, but we insist on ignoring the costs. We do not take a balanced view on the issue and we now have a situation where the road lobby in this country is extremely powerful and as a result people die prematurely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the tobacco lobby, however, the road lobby will not be so powerful for ever and it will not be able to withstand community opinion on issues of this nature. It will be a long, hard battle to overcome problems such as particulate emissions, but it is going to be done. Already we are seeing, in places like the mecca of freeways, Los Angeles, a shift in public opinion and government opinion occurring. Now, for example, we have a project in the southern part of Los Angeles to build a major new rail link from the city to the southern coastal regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was a bit disturbed to hear earlier in this debate the comment of the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent)&mdash;a member from the other side whom I have some respect for&mdash;when he was referring to vehicle emissions and the National Road Transport Council. His comment was that there are safeguards in this legislation to ensure that we do not have the environment impinging unrealistically in areas with broader implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this a pretty disturbing view from somebody who, I think, is quite a reasonable member in this place. Is it unrealistic to worry about preventing premature deaths in the community? Is it unrealistic to want asthmatics and other sufferers of respiratory illnesses to be able to lead a vaguely normal life? Too often, people in the community treat the environment as if it is some sort of separate thing, as if it is just another thing to be taken into account on a list of a whole heap of things. The environment is us; the environment is people. It is our standard of living; it is our health. It is the physical assets that we, as a community, have built up, and it is our children. It really is a shorthand term for all of these things. It is not just something to which we pay lip-service, where, as soon as there is a bit of pressure from any particular interest group that happens to have a short-term financial interest, we say, `Yes, we are concerned about the environment'. That is simply not the appropriate way to look at these things.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent the inner city area of Melbourne, where the question of extremely high levels of lead in young children's bloodstreams was first brought to public attention about 10 or 12 years ago. My constituents are tired of having their health sacrificed on the altar of worship of freeways, cars and trucks. What they would like to see, and what I would like to see, is massive re-investment in rail and other forms of public transport, adopting world's best practice emission controls on vehicles. There are plenty of people in this place who are very keen on the notion of world's best practice on a few fronts, but they are very selective in how they apply their enthusiasm, so when it comes to things that relate to people dying, or people suffering serious illness or exacerbation of illnesses, then their concerns for world's best practice tend to slide away a bit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, we need to adopt a balanced approach to transport. One of the things that we certainly do not see in Victoria is an integrated approach to transport planning. I cannot make a definitive statement, but I would be surprised if we see it anywhere else in this country, with perhaps one or two exceptions. We have two separate authorities in Victoria. One dealing with roads, Vicroads, regards politicians as minor players who, even though they theoretically represent the community, just flit on and off the stage while Vicroads grinds relentlessly on with its 30-year plans to have freeways throughout Melbourne. The other authorities, totally separate from Vicroads, are the public transport bodies. We have no integrated planning relating to the genuine needs of transport users in Melbourne. The end result is that the force with all the power, all the clout and all the financial strength in the community&mdash;namely, the roads lobby&mdash;wins pretty well every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have to turn these around, that involves some sort of cost on the community. If it involves, for example, problems for the vehicle manufacturing industry, then that is a separate issue. It is an issue that we have got to address, and it is an issue that we have got to tackle very seriously&mdash;but it is a separate issue. My view, in the case of the  example of the vehicle industry, would be that we ought not just say, `Forget it, because of the cost that will impose on the vehicle industry; we will let the asthmatics and other respiratory illness sufferers continue to suffer and we will let people die prematurely.' What we should say is, `If solving this problem is going to impose some additional cost on that industry, then we, as a community, have to work out a way to counteract that.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional way is&mdash;or has been&mdash;tariffs and, obviously, one very simplistic way of doing that would be to jack up the tariff again, or alter the timetable for tariff reduction to take account of it. There are much more sophisticated things we could do. I commend the bill to the Committee. I think this is one very small step towards a genuine national approach on environmental matters, and it is a good step. </PARA>

For that reason I took particular note of the remarks made by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) in his reference to the need for a referendum to give the Commonwealth overriding powers in that particular area. That, of course, is a battle that has yet to be fought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that over the last 20 years we have seen the Commonwealth increasingly use its environmental powers, limited though they be. As I said, there are no express powers under the constitution in relation to the environment. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has sought to use other heads of power, principally under section 51 of the constitution, to achieve particular environmental outcomes. For example, the external affairs power was used to claim sovereignty over the continental shelf; sandmining on Fraser Island has been prevented by the use of the trade and commerce power; and rainforests in Queensland and wilderness in Tasmania were preserved using legislation relying on the external affairs power to implement our international treaty obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This utilisation of the powers under section 51 of the constitution clearly has contrasted with the previous cooperative approach which relied on intergovernmental agreements with the states. One would hope, therefore, that this step today is not necessarily a turning back of the tide, shall we say, to the inevitable onrush of federal intervention but, rather, an acknowledgment by the Commonwealth that in many issues there is a need to establish a framework which involves both the Commonwealth and the states working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly pertinent in that context that it was at a special Premiers Conference in Brisbane, on 30 October 1990, that the question of implementation of a national environmental strategy which would involve both the Commonwealth and the states was first discussed. I would just like to note for the record the resolution that came from that meeting. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to avoid conflicts there is a need for a new approach which recognises the national and/or international aspects of environmental decision making but which also recognises the roles of the States and Territories. Central to this is the better definition of the respective roles of the Commonwealth and the States and Territories with regard to environmental policy formulation and implementation.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this initiative came from the states. It was an acknowledgment that all levels of government have different roles in environmental protection and management, and that any agreement should outline respective roles and responsibilities accordingly. A formal intergovernmental agreement setting out in broad terms the agreed roles of the various levels of government would provide, and has provided, a mechanism for defining respective interests and responsibilities and for better developing and implementing environmental policy across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, an intergovernmental agreement on the environment was signed by the Commonwealth, the states, territories and the Local Government Association on 1 May 1992. That agreement provided a useful mechanism for a cooperative national approach and, as I said, a better definition of the roles of governments. It acknowledges the national concern of the Commonwealth in environmental issues while, at the same time, clearly providing the states with a significant part to play in the Commonwealth's international negotiations on the environment. It also recognises the trans-boundary nature of environmental concerns and, therefore, the need for ecologically sustainable development and the importance of sustainable land use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that clause 14 of this bill sets out in detail the measures to be known as national environment protection measures which relate to one or other of the following issues in relation to trans-boundary responsibilities for the environment. It mentions air quality, marine, estuarine and fresh water quality, the protection of amenity in relation to noise, general guidelines for the assessment of site contamination, environment impact associated with hazardous waste, reuse and recycling of used materials, motor vehicle noise and emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, sadly, that there is no reference there to revegetation or to the maintenance or improvement of Australian soil. I think those two matters are of enormous importance and, again, can be closely related to the fact that environmental problems do not begin or end simply on the basis of state boundaries. They are national issues, and I would hope that the issues of revegetation and soil are not to be in any sense downgraded in this particular context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the National Environment Protection Council and I have gone through the history of the events leading up to that. The role of the NEPC will be to develop these national measures and, therefore, it is certainly a significant step forward. A proviso is also made for the NEPMs concerning motor vehicle noise and emissions and this means that the object of the exercise will be to work towards a national environment protection standard and also national environment protection goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A national environment protection guideline is defined in clause 6 as a guideline that gives guidance on possible means for achieving desired environmental outcomes across the spectrum. Consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development and to ensure simplicity and effectiveness of administration, the council will be developing these NEPMs through a public consultative process. While no detail is given in the bill as to what that process will involve, nevertheless it is an area which demonstrates the need to involve not only government but also the community and interest groups working together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe one of the most significant aspects of this council is that the council's decisions must be supported by the votes of at least two-thirds of the members, whether they are present or not. The fact that decisions are to be made on a two-thirds majority distinguishes this council from other ministerial councils which tend to work on the unanimity rule wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important part of the process of developing the NEPMs is for the states and the territories to be fully involved and that the process itself should be clearly open to public comment. Some states already have mechanisms in this regard. I should mention Victoria here where there is a process to settling air and water pollution guidelines through the Victorian Environment Protection Authority, the EPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the authority released a set of draft recommendations detailing the findings of an extensive review of the state environment protection policy relating to the air environment outlining reductions in levels of lead, sulfur dioxide and ozone below current objectives. This is not the case in some other states and territories but again it demonstrates the fact that, while there is clearly, under the council, significant opportunities for the states to develop unique policies relating to their own problems, nevertheless the purpose of the council is to establish what can best be described as minimum national standards which, hopefully, will be achieved by all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the IGAE the states and the territories have also agreed to introduce complementary legislation which will establish the council in all their respective jurisdictions and enforcement of the NEPMs will be achieved through appropriate mechanisms such as state and Commonwealth environment protection authorities. Under clause 17 of schedule 5, this legislation will establish that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NEPC will take over some of the functions of the state and territory environmental instrumentalities. However, the implementation of the NEPMs will still be the responsibility of the states and the territories through respective complementary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, in the second reading speech made what I thought was a particularly pertinent point when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council will be assisted by a statutory committee of Commonwealth and state officials and by a small secretariat staffed by Commonwealth public servants but established as a separate service corporation accountable to the council. It is not proposed to create a substantial new bureaucracy for the development of national environment protection measures.</PARA>
<PARA>I noted in this context that this backup arrangement is going to have a grand total of nine public servants. Where they are required to do specific research work they will, of course, draw on the resources of the existing state EPAs. The total costs of this exercise in 1994-95 will be a fairly modest $896,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is pertinent, however, in this particular context to make a brief reference to the position of Western Australia. Although Western Australia was a signatory to the intergovernmental agreement, the Western Australian government has indicated that it will not be participating in the council at this stage. While this does not invalidate the national scheme, the automatic application of national environmental protection measures in Western Australia will clearly not be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian minister for the environment has released a paper outlining his government's reasons for the council not being approved. I think we should address these reasons in some measure. Firstly, according to the Western Australian government, the council overrides the state minister in cabinet and therefore the state parliament will forfeit powers to disallow regulations. Secondly, uniform national standards are impractical, whereas local solutions are required because of regional diversity. Thirdly, the council adds a new layer of administration which will only reduce international competitiveness. Finally, the council will be administering inefficient and duplicate state processes. Maybe that will be the case. We will have to hope that it will not be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that the NEPMs, and the council itself, under its charter, will in fact be required to take into account regional variations and that the NEPC will not aim for strict uniformity, but rather for a consistent approach to environmental protection. I would have thought that the Western Australian government's concerns and fears&mdash;legitimate or not, as the case may ultimately prove to be&mdash;would have been better protected had it been an active participant in the council from the beginning, rather than remaining out at this particular stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has also been claimed by the Western Australian authorities that the council will be administratively inefficient. As I stated, with the council having a secretariat of no more than nine, it is rather difficult to seriously argue that there is going to be some massive duplication of responsibilities or administrative overlays between the Commonwealth and the states. Finally, with regard to the states with higher standards than those set by the NEPC, we should not forget the point I made earlier that the council's role is to set minimum standards and not maximum standards. If states want to go above the standard, that is fair enough. That is entirely a state responsibility and something to be applauded; because, by setting high standards in some states, it is hoped that overall standards will rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Establishing a minimum national standard means that those states which are below that standard obviously have to come up to it, and that is an internal disciplinary measure which is very useful in this particular context. Consequently, states which have higher standards will push for comparable national standards to avoid comparative disadvantage. I frankly believe that the major issues which the Western Australian government has claimed as being difficulties in this matter are in fact straw men&mdash;straw `persons' might be a more appropriate term to use in this day&mdash;and therefore it would have been preferable had it decided to be an active participant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to re-emphasise the fact that we in Australia, with this vast continent and a relatively small population located principally on the coastline, must understand the ecology of our environment. Therefore, there is a need to emphasise the harmonisation of national measures rather than to seek uniform national measures; because the conditions in Western Australia ecologically are certainly not the same as on the eastern coastal fringe, any more than they are the same as in the central desert hinterland of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We therefore recognise&mdash;and we accept the opposition in the context of this legislation&mdash;that the states will still have considerable autonomy to determine the extent to which they set these standards; provided, as I said, that they reach the necessary minimum. Measures will be needed to implement, differently in each state and territory, the standards which in most cases are applicable to their circumstances. The states are also being given significant independence as to how the NEPMs are implemented at the state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The emphasis is therefore on harmonisation and national measures rather than on uniformity. We constantly hear this fear from some of the states about uniformity across the nation. One thing is absolutely clear: in environmental matters, uniformity is not necessarily the way to go. But the maintenance of agreed national standards which set minimums which are more or less obligatory is certainly an indicator of the direction in which Australia needs to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that we have seen similar trends taking place. For example, the German government has introduced wide ranging and stringent waste minimisation and pollution reduction strategies. In a few years it will be impossible to trade with Germany unless goods are, for example, 90 per cent recyclable. To export to countries such as Germany and the United States, which have established very high environmental standards, it is necessary that Australia also have high standards and that it presents a national position. Otherwise, ultimately our capacity to trade internationally is going to be affected in a negative sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth noting in our own environment that ASEAN decided last June that uniform standards are needed across the six participating countries. They have got some distance to go but it demonstrates this awareness internationally of the need to increase environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of major environmental issues which I would like to refer to. Almost all the measures and mechanisms for the enforcement of pollution control in Australia are determined and administered by the states and territories. This results in the danger of companies being able to `forum shop': if they want to pollute they can find one deal in one state which makes it economically more beneficial than in another. It is precisely those sorts of attitudes that we need to change. It is also important to try to regulate our response to environmental law to make it consistent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I note some of the major environmental issues facing this country. We have water pollution; we have blue-green algae blooms on our major rivers&mdash;not just the Murray-Darling but also in south-eastern Australia and even the Hawkesbury River; and the Murray-Darling system is in a critical state. When I was the shadow minister for the environment back in 1983 we tried to identify the problems and, sadly, we are more than conscious that they exist today. In fact, it is claimed that the Murray-Darling Basin will require some 15 billion trees alone to give any reasonable chance of rehabilitation. Therefore, the whole Murray-Darling Basin should be seen as a national project of first priority in the environmental rehabilitation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have other issues, such as sewage treatment and discharge, which were referred to by my colleague, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur). We have ground water pollution, which is a growing problem. We have salinity, which, again, is a growing problem, especially in areas of eastern Australia as a result of the heavy rainfall of recent years, areas which are now having exactly the opposite problem with a major drought. Overall in this dry continent we have the problem of water quality, which affects both our rural environment and our metropolitan environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hazardous waste is going to be an intractable issue and, again, is going to require the coordination of laws and regulations between the states and the Commonwealth. We have the growth of recycling which is an important area. In fact, the federal government imposes a 21 per cent sales tax on recycled plastic. The question has to be asked, `Why?' Such a high level of sales tax is a disincentive for people to recycle plastic. These are the changes we would like to see in the system so it can be genuinely said that environmental policies are being activated and carried through the parliamentary process in a way which encourages the community to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have other areas of recycling, such as building rubble, plastics and newsprint.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today's debate on the National Environment Protection Council Bill 1994 displays the problems that we have, as a Commonwealth parliament, in being able to come to grips with matters that are of national importance. They are matters under the constitution which we, as the national parliament, have some difficulty in legislating about. As has been said earlier in this debate, because of the changes in the way that we view the environment, changes that have occurred over the last 100 years, it has been highlighted that we have had to come to some mechanism that evolves out of what has been given the title&mdash;to use the jargon&mdash;`cooperative federalism', which allows us to put in place goals that we might be able to achieve.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us this piece of legislation which arises, of course, out of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment which was signed in May 1992. There has been some comment that it has taken four years to get to this stage but I think that, given the evolution of the types of solutions that we have to come up with to get around the constitutional problems with which we are confronted, those four years seem reasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wishing to perhaps torture the agreement that has been displayed on this piece of legislation across the parliament, one just wonders why we cannot have a mature look at the constitution to make the constitution more contemporary on issues such as the environment and other issues that have developed over the past century. I have often remarked that it is amazing how people wish to protect the constitution, which was developed in the 1890s and developed by the founding fathers. The use of that word `father' is interesting, because it was an all-male group of people who put it together. To that extent, it reflected the society within which the constitution was being put together. I only make that comment because there are obvious changes in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, quite coincidentally, on the first piece of legislation I ever spoke on in this Main Committee, we are long past the time where we should look upon the constitution as a mechanism that has hobbled together the six colonies as a federation. We should be seeing that there are responsibilities that we have at a national level. As I say, I do not wish to labour that point in the context of this legislation, because I value some of the contributions that I have been able to listen to from members opposite about some of the difficulties that we had in getting to this stage with this National Environment Protection Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, I thought that the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), who spoke before me, made some very correct and relevant remarks about the position that we see with the present Western Australian government. He went through some of the concerns that have been put forward by that government, and indicated that there is really no need for that government to have those concerns and that it really does have to look at what is being set up under the umbrella of the National Environment Protection Council. That government has to look at the protections that would be available if it were to be an active member of that council, in relation to the way in which decisions are made&mdash;the majority by which those decisions must be made. It must realise that if it is really talking about competitiveness, it should be looking in the real world as we know it at the moment. Recognisable and appropriate environmental standards on which the manufacture of goods or other things are based are very important for our ability to be able to promote goods and to be able to get access to certain markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that we have before us has the undertaking that this will be, as a new administrative unit, a fairly lean unit and that it will take on board the expertise that has been developed over time by different agencies within the states. Recognising that there is the potential for duplication and that there might be the potential for wasteful use of resources, the point is that this outcome is a mechanism that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without trying to involve you in the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker, I know that for many years you were a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts. I think that you were on the committee from 1987 to 1993, when I was also a member. One of the things that was always put to that committee, no matter what reference was before it, was the lack of national standards, and the lack of consistency between the national standards and the various standards that the state and territory governments put in place. That issue is put before the committee regardless of whether it is the land degradation inquiry or the coastal management inquiry. It is even an issue in the inquiry that the committee is presently undertaking into environmental aspects that affect employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting and appropriate to note that issue in the context of some of the criticism that the Western Australian government has made. It is often industry that comes forward to suggest that there is a need for a national standard. As I said, even in the present inquiry, that is one of the things that people in industry say will assist them to be able to develop `green jobs' in a whole range of sectors. In the April 1991 report of the House of Representatives Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Injured Coastline</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the report of the inquiry on coastal management&mdash;we had a recommendation that the national water quality guidelines, based on the assimilative capacity of the receiving waters, be prepared as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage, we had to suggest that perhaps the people in ANZECC, the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, or in Australian water resources should be the ones who develop the national standards. As I understand it, they are the people who&mdash;even under the mechanism of the environment protection council&mdash;are called upon to be involved in development. However, once those standards are developed, they would have the imprimatur of the council, which of course would have all the states&mdash;except, at this stage, Western Australia&mdash;involved in it. It is something that would have some substantive strength, even though it would not have any constitutional base and would be a cooperative agreement. As some commentators have suggested, if these things were to be tested, the High Court might have an interesting job in considering the standing of some of the determinations of the council. But that is something that we are going to have to look at in the context of being mature about our ability to discuss constitutional change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem that we often find in the House of Representatives environment committee inquiries is the lack of basic data about the state of the environment. I know that this is a bit different from the types of standards that this bill talks about the council setting, but if we do not have monitoring standards, we will have great difficulty in being able to see whether we are successful in what we trying to achieve in relation to the way that we treat the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, when the minister released the state of the environment reporting framework for Australia earlier this year in June, one of the things that he highlighted about the system is that it will allow for an agreed set of national indicators. In talking about those indicators, the minister made the observation that even those people out in the community who are perhaps not totally economically literate are economically literate enough to know that things such as the CPI are very important monitoring standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why have we not a culture that suggests that environmental standards have the same status? Why is it not that the imagination of the Australian community is captured&mdash;so that if we have indications of the standards of air, or indications of the standard of water, that are regularly promoted to the Australian public, we can, over time, assess whether or not we are achieving those outcomes. It is one of the important bases that we have. Why does the Australian public not demand that we assess whether outcomes are positive or whether we are doing negative things that are not indicated through the mechanisms that we have set in place to protect the environment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that, in putting together an agreed set of national indicators, it is likely that we will have reference to the regional differences that affect those indicators. Again, that is one of the things that the Western Australian government seems a bit hung up about at the moment. It believes that, by putting in place the measures under this piece of legislation, those types of regional factors will not be allowed for. That is just a nonsense, and I ask why is it that the other states and territories can find their way clear to be agreeable. They can see that&mdash;in terms of what the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said&mdash;the spirit of the agreement was in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schedule to this bill, where the agreement is set out, makes interesting reading as one reads the list of people that were signatories. Some of them have gone onto other roles&mdash;unfortunately, in three of the states, at grave consequence to the party to which I belong. But if it was good enough for two out of three of those states to say, I think earlier this year at the COAG meeting, that they were quite happy with this agreement, and if even the government led by Jeffrey `Glib' Kennett, as the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) would say, can see its way clear to be involved&mdash;and I say that as a Victorian&mdash;then there should be no impediment in the Western Australian government's attitude to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to briefly mention that this was one of the first agreements where the role of local government was recognised. In fact, the President of the Australian Local Government Association was a signatory to the agreement. Again, because of the constitutional difficulties in recognising local government, that is an interesting sidelight, but it is important to recognise that, when it comes to the protection of the environment, all spheres of government have a role to play. It is no use spheres of government taking the view that they have competing roles. The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) talked about the generational effects of the way we treat our environment. It is important that the spheres of government recognise that that is what the protection of the environment is about: it is as much about what we are trying to do in the present as what we are trying to do for future generations. That is of paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we are getting to the stage where we recognise that we have to have a national approach. Environmental problems do not have any hang-up about geopolitical borders that are drawn across maps. We need a national approach to resolve some of the problems that have been mentioned, whether the problems are things such as the algal bloom or motor vehicle emissions. There are similar problems across the nation and they can be addressed in similar ways, recognising that, in properly effecting the solutions, we have to take into account regional conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I may have sounded like a centralist at the start because I expressed a preference that I would rather see a constitutional solution to these problems, I recognise that, in the administration, and in the ability to achieve outcomes on the ground, we have to take into account regional differences, and that can be achieved by regional administrations. Whether those regional administrations are state and territory governments or local governments at the moment, I do not really mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The concept of `surplus to position requirements' is not one that is formally recognised under the Public Service Act 1922 or the APS Redeployment and Retirement (Redundancy) Award 1987, and statistics on officers who are surplus to position requirements are not readily available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Award, where it appears that APS staff are likely to become `excess to a department's requirements', the Secretary of the department must provide details to, and arrange discussions with, the relevant union. When those discussions have been completed, the Secretary may formally advise the affected staff that they are excess to the department's requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no central collection point in the Australian Public Service for information on the number of staff who have been formally advised that they are excess to departments' requirements. However, under the 1992 APS Workplace Bargaining Agreement, there is provision for departments to refer to the Central Redeployment Unit (CRU) officers and employees who have been declared excess and who do not wish to pursue voluntary retrenchment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Unit's functions have now been assumed by the APS Labour Market Adjustment Branch in the Public Service Commission. As at 9 September 1994 that Branch had 59 referrals of excess officers and employees on hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Award arrangements allow for staff who become excess to be retained in employment for seven months (or thirteen months for staff who are over 45 years of age or have more than 20 years' service). The majority of the 59 excess staff are in the thirteen month category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fortnightly cost of salary for the 59 excess staff is approximately $71,700. The full salary cost of employing them cannot be estimated because it is not known how many will be redeployed before the expiration of the relevant retention periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) According to the most recently published statistics, contained in the Department of Finance's Australian Public Service Staffing Statistics Report 1993, the number of staff in the APS declined by 0.8% in the calendar year 1993. Final statistics for the 1993-94 financial year are not yet available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labour Market Adjustment Branch was set up to assist in the redeployment of excess staff across the APS. Together with its predecessor, the CRU, the Branch has assisted in the successful redeployment of 40 excess officers and employees since 1 July 1993.</PARA>
