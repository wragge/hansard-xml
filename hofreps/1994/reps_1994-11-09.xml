<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the declaration by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs of 10 July 1994, as contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS> No. S270, and made under subsection 10(1) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, relating to Hindmarsh Island, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>As the local member for this area of Hindmarsh Island, which is situated at the lower reaches of the Murray River&mdash;one part of it faces the Murray mouth&mdash;I say at the outset that there is great consternation in the area about the enormous delay, the great number of reports and the fracas that has taken place regarding the building of this bridge. I was not in favour of government money going into this bridge. It seemed to me that such money could be better spent elsewhere. I have known the area all my life and I have never seen in that area more consternation about one particular development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I could take honourable members quickly through the history of this matter, in 1977 Binalong Pty Ltd, a company owned by the Chapman family, purchased land on Hindmarsh Island. In 1983 work began on a marina basin off the island. In 1989 cabinet approval in South Australia was given to the bridge and proposals of Binalong subject to a satisfactory EIS. In 1990 cabinet approved the development, confirmed by the Governor-in-Council, for the marina extensions, including the bridge and at that stage the government said it would assist with the funding of the bridge to a maximum of $3 million. In 1990 the Aboriginal heritage branch of the Department of Environment and Planning authorised the establishment of the marina `as no Aboriginal sites will be affected by the development'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 as a result of financial difficulties with Binalong, the state government agreed to fund and construct the bridge. In 1993 expressions of concern from the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee about the bridge proposal appeared and in December 1993 there was a change in the state government. Work on the bridge was suspended while Mr Justice Jacobs prepared a report he was asked to prepare by Minister Diana Laidlaw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1993, a delegation from the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee met with Minister Tickner to discuss Aboriginal sites and burial grounds on Hindmarsh Island. There was no mention of the women's issues which were later to become seminal in this decision of the minister. In February 1994, Mr Jacobs's report was presented to the government, confirming its liability to build the bridge. In April 1994, work on the bridge was suspended again following a letter from the Aboriginal legal rights movement about further sites. On 12 May 1994, the minister announced a section 9 declaration which prevented the building of the bridge for 30 days, and on 10 June a further declaration under section 9 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act extended that delay for another 30 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 20 June, the first reference of the women's issues I referred to a moment ago was received as a result of a meeting of 35 Ngarrindjeri women at the Graham's Castle and Conference Centre in Victor Harbour. On 7 July the minister prepared, as we understand it, a draft order and received Professor Saunders's report and the Fergie report. The Fergie report was a report by Dr Deane Fergie, who was employed as an anthropologist by the Aboriginal legal rights movement to assist in this inquiry. On 10 July, the minister announced his declaration of a 25-year ban. I think the order was made on 9 July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all of this time, after a number of reports, after an enormous number of dollars being spent, after having had two female ministers in the responsible positions in South Australia, after having the contracts signed by the state government and work allocated, and after having had a report by Mr Justice Jacobs saying that this work to build the Hindmarsh Island bridge should go ahead and that the South Australian government had no option, all of a sudden some new material&mdash;known as women's business, women's knowledge or women's issues&mdash;appeared. At no point in the past had that material arisen. Current legal and political options had been exhausted and, after millions of dollars of expenditure and a decision by the South Australian government&mdash;contrary to its views on the matter&mdash;the decision to build the bridge was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then in June there was a threat by Mr Matt Rigney of ATSIC in Adelaide to withdraw a billion dollars in funds from its bankers, Westpac. It is interesting to note, although it may have no relevance, that Doreen Kartinyeri's mother&mdash;Doreen Kartinyeri is the one who brought forward this women's business&mdash;was a Rigney. On 23 December 1993, the Aboriginal legal rights movement wrote to the minister on behalf of the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee claiming that the work will damage Aboriginal sites. Of course, we know what happened from then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of what I wish to raise today is probably contained in a speech made by the Hon. Justice Michael Kirby in 1980, when he was commenting on some work done by Professor Strehlow, the late world-renowned anthropologist who specialised in Aboriginal affairs. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Original indigenous traditions are irretrievably on the way out.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether we agree with that or not is another matter. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few if any experts and spokesmen have a deep knowledge of Aboriginal customary laws anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the point he makes is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not feasible to present to parliament for blind adoption unstated secret rules, the very existence of which could not be recounted to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That is really the essence of the first point I wish to make today. When the minister issued his declaration on 10 July, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the evidence available to me, including all written representations and the report and attached representations which I have received from Professor Cheryl Saunders under section 10(4) of the act, lead me to conclude that the area is of particular significance to the Ngarrindjeri people within the meaning of the act and is under threat of injury or desecration.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, he made reference to the fact that the area was under particular threat to the cultural significance of those people within the knowledge of the Ngarrindjeri people, which he said concerns the life force itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply repeat that, until 12 May, when Doreen Kartinyeri&mdash;she has at times worked for the Adelaide museum and is a friend of Dr Deane Fergie, a female anthropologist, who was, as I said before, employed by the Aboriginal legal rights movement&mdash;wrote to the minister and said that this knowledge of hers was recent information, nobody that I know and can discern knew of this women's business. So we have a circumstance where, out of the blue and out of the past, if you like, came some information of which nobody could possibly have pre-knowledge. Doreen Kartinyeri said to the minister, `I have always known about the stories associated with the Ramindjeri, a clan nearby, and the Ngarrindjeri women's business, but until recently I did not know the exact place they referred to.' So that letter and information came forward to the minister, and presumably Cheryl Saunders, no earlier than early May this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doreen Kartinyeri refers to an exact place. But, as the minister will know, when Professor Saunders made her recommendations to the minister, she did not talk about an exact place. She talked about an area of significance which encompasses such areas as the Murray mouth in general, Hindmarsh Island and the Mundoo islands, and the surrounding and separating waters in particular, as crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people and their continued existence. That area is hundreds of square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of a sudden we have Doreen Kartinyeri saying that she only became aware of the exact place in recent times. However, the exact place in Professor Cheryl Saunders's mind is an area which is variously described in her report. But, in any case, it is a minimum area of hundreds of square kilometres. That seems to me to be a problem. Those on the outside, such as we who are here today as the judge and jury, have no definitive, exact place to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the place described by Doreen Kartinyeri, who is the principal supplier of the information about women's business, is an exact place; yet in the hands of the reporter, Cheryl Saunders, it is not an exact place. In fact, it is a place which comprises many hundreds of square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, that is a problem which is nearly beyond understanding and which is quite unclear in the recommendations to the minister. The minister made a recommendation to ban the bridge site itself. That may have been the requirement that he had to finally come to under the act. But how anybody else can understand for the future what area will or may come under some future declaration when the information comes out of the Saunders report is very unclear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like to make is that nobody, with the exception of Doreen Kartinyeri, seemed to know of the secret knowledge. I doubt whether the significant camp sites which have been talked about before were important enough. How do I know that? Because on 13 April ATSIC advised the South Australian Aboriginal legal rights movement that, if it had some evidence of cultural matters, it would strengthen the minister's hands. In other words, it said: up to this point, we're not doing very well, so you'd better do better than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within a few days, Doreen Kartinyeri emerges with new information of significance to Aboriginal women on Hindmarsh Island. For the outsider&mdash;we are the outsiders, but we are also the judge and jury today&mdash;that is a very inconclusive situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on the subject of secret knowledge and the significance of the area as a whole, I simply say that Professor Saunders was categorically wrong when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final aspect of significance of the area, identified also by Mr S. J. Jacobs in his report to the current government as potentially the most serious, involves the secret knowledge of women.</PARA>
<PARA>I read paragraph 25 of the report to Mr Justice Jacobs last Friday. His reply to me was that that was outrageous. He said it was outrageous because he had never heard of any women's business when he wrote his report. How could he when you think about it? The fact is that even Doreen Kartinyeri did not know about the significance of women's business when Mr Jacobs wrote the report. The minister did not have much time to read Cheryl Saunders's report. It came to him on the 7th, he made a declaration on the 9th and he announced it on the 10th. But there already is an absolute inaccuracy in that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get to the second matter. Why would the minister not allow Minister Laidlaw of the South Australian government to read the sealed envelopes? After all his adviser, Suzanne Kee, has apparently read them. She advised the minister that the confidential appendices contained nothing that might make him change his mind. Dr Deane Fergie obviously knew what was in those appendices, as she had put them together. Ann Mullins, helping Professor Saunders, knew what was in them. Suzanne Kee, working in the minister's office, knew what was in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the South Australian minister does not know what is in them. When she wrote and asked the minister if she could know what was in them, he refused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has not confirmed anywhere to my knowledge that he has either seen or not seen the contents of those two attachments to the Fergie report, which are not to be seen by men. So that we know that the decision was made sight unseen and so that we know that the minister did not read all the evidence, I would like him to confirm that he has not seen either of those two reports or been told about the contents. After all of these reports and this publicity, it transpires that on 12 May Doreen Kartinyeri, who works for the Adelaide museum, comes up with the answer, after the minister was advised by ATSIC and other Aboriginal organisations that something had to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me raise the last matter, which I think the minister needs to reply to. On 8 July he wrote to ATSIC asking to be compensated if he made this declaration and if it were to cost the minister or his department any money. How do I know that? Because in an open court judicial review hearing in Adelaide on this matter, Lois O'Donoghue wrote back to the minister and said that she was examining the matter of whether or not ATSIC could compensate him. In a letter dated 8 July this year, in reply to a letter that the minister wrote on 8 July, Lois O'Donoghue stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, you sought my assurance that ATSIC would be prepared to play a part in meeting costs if and when this occurred. I can assure you that this important financial question will be put to the board&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is of ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">at its next meeting in August.</PARA>
<PARA>I put it to the minister that the only way he would have to compensate somebody in this matter would be if he had acquired land. He has already written to the Chapman solicitors saying that he did not have any idea that this was an acquisition of land. He had dismissed that idea, and I think one would have to agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other way that he could be compensated by ATSIC would be if he were contemplating doing something unlawful. There is no way that ATSIC could possibly compensate him. Apart from anything else&mdash;and it would be a good idea for him to get some information on this&mdash;he was asking ATSIC to do something unlawful. He was asking ATSIC to do things that were in no way in its charter within the ATSIC Act. I put it to the minister that all of this coercion and all of this organisation have gone too far, and he needs to explain that to this House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In trying to get through the first sentence in this debate, to face incessant interjections from the opposition after I made not one interjection during the entire contribution I must say is a bit galling. I first approached this matter on the basis that this issue&mdash;it is on the public record&mdash;is currently being challenged in the courts. Therefore, some matters that I might otherwise say in the course of this debate I will, out of respect for that judicial process, refrain from saying. Nevertheless, there are other very important matters that I would seek to put on the public record in the course of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I emphasise is what the law requires of me as the federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. The legal provisions are contained in section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. It sets out very precisely my obligations&mdash;not my options&mdash;as the federal minister under the law. One of the obligations I clearly have, when faced with an application for heritage protection of this nature, is to commission a report under section 4 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commissioning that report, I sought to choose a person of such eminence and standing that that person would be beyond reproach. I would hope that in the course of this debate no-one would be making reflections on the integrity of Professor Cheryl Saunders AO, who is the head of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at the University of Melbourne and someone who is respected by both sides of politics in this House. What I did, following the receipt of that report and all the other advice and representations that were made to me, was issue a declaration to protect Aboriginal heritage. A number of aspects of Professor Saunders's report are quite unambiguous in what they told me. In her first conclusion she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is . . . open to the Minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to conclude that the area has particular significance for Aboriginal people within the meaning of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>It would also be open to the minister to recognise that the area is under threat of injury or desecration from the construction of the proposed bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She went on to highlight a number of other matters that I ought to consider when determining whether or not to make the declaration. The issues in Professor Saunders's report, and in the representations made to me, weighed very heavily on my conscience. I am deeply conscious of the responsibilities I have as the federal minister to protect Aboriginal heritage, but I also have to consider other interests that may be affected in relation to a possible declaration in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA>In other words, here is an existing continuing spiritual belief of indigenous people that they regard as of immense importance. That was, I have to tell honourable members, something that weighed very heavily on my mind when determining what course of action I should adopt.

The attitudes that have been expressed by many people are unquestionably based on a dismissive view of Aboriginal spiritual beliefs. They are attitudes which are implicitly based on racial superiority.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that, on the issue of respect for Aboriginal beliefs, I welcome the support shown by the Australian Christian churches, in addition to the views expressed by believers of many other faiths that are practised in this country. However, I regret to say that in the aftermath of my decision on Hindmarsh Island bridge there was some woeful distortion of the impact of my decision and the basis on which that decision was made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me first of all give honourable members a categorical assurance that my decision was in no way based on the envelopes that were not available for inspection by me as a non-Aboriginal male person. The Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>, which from day one has repeatedly trotted out this hoary old lie, is to be condemned for the way that it misrepresents the facts of the matter. I said from day one that I did not rely on those envelopes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Premier of South Australia went on to ludicrously assert that, somehow or other, my decision affected hundreds of kilometres of the River Murray and was to threaten the water supplies of South Australia.

The assertions about the wide impact of my declaration are without foundation. The declaration is limited specifically and deliberately to the site of the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to look at the past stand of some of my opponents in relation to this particular issue. The first person that I would refer to is indeed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) himself, who was reported in the South Australian country magazine as stating that, despite strong business support for the bridge in Goolwa, the bridge was `a bridge to nowhere'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm sure it will be convenient to have the bridge, but at what price?</PARA>
<PARA>The Premier of South Australia, as recently as 9 October 1993, said that, if the Liberals won government in South Australia, `all contracts regarding the bridge would be examined'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely developers don't expect the state government to act as the main risk-taker for private developers. That's the State Bank revisited.</PARA>
<PARA>That was said by the Premier of South Australia. Indeed, the member for Barker has admitted in the course of this debate his own longstanding opposition to the bridge. He made, again, further comments as recently as 12 October when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've said all the time and all along that in my view the building of the bridge to Hindmarsh Island was a waste of money.</PARA>
<PARA>He made that comment on radio station 5AN. I think we have to ask ourselves: where is the respect of the coalition&mdash;where is the respect of the member for Barker and the Premier of South Australia&mdash;for the sanctity of the processes, for the sanctity of the contracts in relation to this particular issue? You were on the record as a coalition, as was the Premier of South Australia, saying that if you could come to government and overturn the processes, if you could stop the bridge, if you could get out of the contracts, then you would&mdash;but you could not. </PARA>

It has always been my view that if issues of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs generally, including the issue of heritage protection, can be elevated to a position of cross-party and inter-governmental support then that is the direction in which I think we should proceed. Indeed, in the One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) foreshadowed, at my request, an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to try to get a cooperative arrangement between Commonwealth, state and territory governments with respect to Aboriginal heritage protection. I am pleased to report to the House that last week, at a meeting of Aboriginal affairs ministers in Sydney, there was unanimous adoption, at my suggestion, of a framework for review of both Commonwealth and state-territory heritage protection laws as a national priority to better protect Aboriginal sites.</PARA></TALK.START>

I stress to the House that the review will attempt to minimise delays and the risk of Commonwealth intervention. What the Commonwealth will not do is abdicate the power given to this parliament by the 1967 referendum. While I am the minister, that power will be exercised sparingly and in accordance with proper processes. But, as in this case, if necessary it will be used to protect the human rights and spiritual beliefs of the indigenous people of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of this disallowance motion. I am quite distressed by the way in which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) goes about this type of debate. He does not come into this place seeking a bipartisan approach to issues. He does not come with that attitude at all. The emotional response which we saw today shows that fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the minister when he says that this is about due processes and following through on these types of issues. This motion is about due process. The information on which the minister has made his decision is a very important point for debate. It may not be the first, but it is certainly a very crucial and maybe fulcrum point in this debate. I believe we have an evidential exocet in the type of knowledge we accept into this parliament. I will go into that in detail in a few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I want to take up what the minister said in response to the shadow minister for environment and heritage, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan). The minister was asked whether he saw the material or whether he was told about the contents of the material. The minister avoided those two questions. He said, `I did not rely on the secret envelopes.' He did not say that he did not see them, and he did not say that he was not told about the contents. He avoided answering that question. We would like to know whether the minister saw the material or whether he was told about the contents of the material. I ask the minister, as part of the due process, to come clean and directly answer with that information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This motion is about openness by government. There has been a lack of openness by the minister on the processes in this federal parliament. I support the minister in his addressing of the law, as he is a minister responsible for particular acts in this parliament. Every minister has to consider those areas. In particular, he has to consider heritage protection in Aboriginal affairs. That is a responsibility which every minister responsible for that portfolio has to take on. I want to look at the information provided to the minister on which he made that decision. I refer to three particular quotes from a document by Professor Saunders. The first one states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection of the area is sought by the applicants on another ground . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is apart from the significance of permanent camps and a number of burial sites. Going on to the second key point of her argument:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Protection of the area is sought by the applicants on another ground as well, of great potential significance.</PARA>
<PARA>At this time, the professor could not actually say that these things were significant. They were only potentially significant. Professor Saunders continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representations to me, authorised by a large representative group of Ngarrindjeri women, speak of the spiritual and cultural significance of Hindmarsh and Mundoo Islands, the waters of the Goolwa channel, Lake Alexandrina and the Murray Mouth within the sacred traditions of Ngarrindjeri women, crucial for the reproduction of the Ngarrindjeri people. One of the custodians of this knowledge described the area to me as "the most important place for the Aboriginal people of the Lower South". Viewed from this perspective, the bridge presents a threat to the area in the form of a permanent prominent and physical link above the water between two parts of the territory which would, in accordance with Ngarrindjeri tradition, render the cosmos, and human beings within it, "sterile" and unable to reproduce. The Ngarrindjeri women believe that construction of the bridge would not only injure and desecrate their traditions but destroy their culture.</PARA>
<PARA>This raises the issue of what the minister has referred to as Aboriginal spirituality and other terms like tradition and culture&mdash;and I want to add the concept of superstition because all cultures have superstition. I ask: did the minister critically examine this report and analyse it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see the minister smiling and thinking, `We can go on the attack here and label people in the opposition with all sorts of terms.' Many in the coalition have a very high respect for Aboriginal culture and traditions, and I do for many cultures. I think much of Aboriginal music and painting, and many other aspects of their culture can and will become part of an Australian identity as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in all cultures there are also superstitions, and we in our own society also critically examine people&mdash;as does this report and the next one I will refer to&mdash;our visions and dreams to see whether there is another way of measuring knowledge. In this report we are saying to the parliament that experiential knowledge does not have to be weighed up against empirical knowledge or knowledge derived through the senses. What you are saying is that revealed knowledge to one individual person can be the basis on which this federal parliament should make decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer in particular to Sarah Milera, who talks about having had this experiential vision. It is used as evidence as to why this area should be prevented from having a bridge built for, say, 25 years. The minister is using experiential knowledge from one person as a basis for this parliament to make a decision which we would say is for the common good of all people in this country. If we are going to use experiential knowledge of individual people from different religious and cultural backgrounds, are we going to do it for all religious and all cultural backgrounds? If somebody from the Buddhist community in Australia came to the government and said, `I have experiential knowledge from a dream which I had,' and asked the government to do certain things, would you give the same status to that cultural belief as you are giving to Aboriginal culture? All I am asking is that we put all this cultural understanding on the same level and use the same processes for everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister and the following speakers: does the government accept experiential knowledge from all cultures represented in Australia? Does it accept that as the basis of knowledge on which the federal parliament should act? The minister has used that view as part of the basis for making his decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the government going to allow all Australians to use knowledge which comes from visionary dreams? I am not denying that people have them; I think people do. But if we are going to accept this as truth and as knowledge on which the federal government should act in regard to the implementation of the laws of this country for the Aboriginal culture then let us make sure all Australians&mdash;the Muslims, the Christians and the Jews that the minister referred to&mdash;know they can also use the same form of knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the government believe that building the bridge renders the cosmos and the human beings sterile? Is that what the government believes? That is what the government, by this motion, says it believes. The government is saying it is accepting this information as knowledge on which a government should operate and base its decisions&mdash;the cabinet of the Commonwealth of Australia. The information given in this report by Professor Saunders is that the Ngarrindjeri women believe the building of this bridge would render the cosmos and the human beings sterile, unable to reproduce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation of the federal cabinet in this country being able to take evidence as truth and knowledge without any critical analysis. I think we should always have critical analysis of whatever comes into this parliament. We see here the government having what I refer to again as evidential exocets now put in place for any people who want to claim, particularly within certain cultures, that they have had a very clear vision of the importance of some aspect of our society or of this land of ours. It can come into tradition and culture tomorrow, even though it has never been heard of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An exocet can be manufactured at any time. This government is showing that it is willing to accept information which comes from, as one person puts it, a dream or a vision. I think we can be tolerant of and respect individual people, but when it comes to public administration of a country we have to weigh up the experience of those individuals or of that individual with the overall common good and the other knowledge which we have in our community and our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the government has acted with propriety in this at all. I do not believe the minister has exercised in any critical way due consideration of the information which was presented to him. There is always a balance and there is always a judgment to be made but, as a federal parliament, surely the government should critically analyse the information provided to it. I do not believe the knowledge and the information the government has used to make this decision is valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to deny Aboriginal spirituality at all. If anybody suggests that, I will reject it, because it is not about that. Most people in this House will accept that view from me. The government has to be open about these processes and not just say that it was the information provided to it. The government has to examine the nature of that information. It has not done that in an open, honest and frank way to the Australian people on this issue. If it is going to do it in this way, as I say, it will develop an evidential exocet to be used in the parliament by anybody on whatever dream or vision they might have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member for Braddon, in his contribution to this debate and challenge to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), sought to ask whether the minister had in fact involved himself in making any personal subjective judgments about the validity of the evidence that was presented and the report that was provided. The member for Braddon talked about due process and following the proper processes in making sure that this parliament and the government acted according to the proper processes in making these decisions. By suggesting that the minister should then engage in some personal analysis of the cultural beliefs of the people involved, he wants to totally throw out the due process that is actually in the act. The due process that is in the act is that an expert report should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is not in a position to make judgments about the validity or otherwise of certain cultural beliefs, dreamings or whatever. That is not his position. It is the responsibility of the minister to ensure that adequate advice is given and that a totally comprehensive report is provided, which is what Professor Cheryl Saunders's report is. It is not up to the minister to then decide, `I do not agree with this bit, I agree with that bit; I am not particularly sure about this dreaming line or whatever.' He has appointed a person of great integrity and credibility on this issue to engage in a detailed study of the claims. The report from Professor Cheryl Saunders strongly recommended the action the minister has taken. If you are therefore challenging the minister's decision, you are challenging the validity of this report and the credibility of the person who was engaged to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have not been honest enough to actually say that. You have skirted around the issue and made all these comments about dreaming and whether the minister has made any judgment about experiential knowledge of one person, et cetera. You are rejecting the Cheryl Saunders report and saying that it has no validity and that the minister should have in fact made personal judgments about the validity or otherwise of a group of people's cultural and spiritual beliefs. That, to me, is a demonstration of massive arrogance on your part and goes to the very essence of the opposition's position on this matter. It demonstrates to me a total ignorance of the minister's responsibility to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has acted completely within the terms of the act and has observed his responsibilities under the act, which the South Australian minister failed to do. The federal Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs has taken this action because his state counterpart failed to carry out his responsibilities. The South Australian government&mdash;even though under its legislation it has broader powers than the federal government&mdash;failed to adequately protect this site of immense significance to the Ngarrindjeri people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal minister became involved only because in the South Australian state government ministerial statement to the parliament on 3 May the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs announced the authorisation of this damage to Aboriginal sites pursuant to section 23 of the state act. It is interesting to note that Dr Armitage, the minister involved, conceded that his decision was one that left him in no doubt of the Aboriginal opposition to the construction of the bridge and that the community would be extremely disappointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find amazing in my analysis of the circumstances around this debate is the position the opposition has taken. We have on the public record comments from the member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and from the state Premier when he was Leader of the Opposition that they did not support the building of the bridge; that they did not believe it was a viable process; that they did not believe it should go ahead. They believed that it was a waste of money and that the money could have been spent somewhere else. But, as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs said, when faced with the choice of respecting the human, cultural and spiritual rights of people or respecting the nebulous concept of states rights&mdash;that does not actually exist; it is a myth that the opposition has created&mdash;they always go towards protecting the rights of state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what this debate is about&mdash;protecting the rights of a political structure rather than the rights of human beings. Every debate we have had in this chamber regarding Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs has come down to that analysis, and on every single occasion the opposition has failed to meet the challenge. It has constantly supported the rights of a political structure, a state government, rather than the rights of human beings, of people, in this country. That is the weakness in your case. You have demonstrated hypocrisy once more in this. You do not support the bridge; you think it is a waste of money. You do not believe that it should go ahead. But, regardless of that, you are prepared to trample on the rights of the Ngarrindjeri people because you believe the state government should have the right to build the bridge. </PARA>

He has said that they have been able to produce in a few months all of this history that did not exist before and that now Cheryl Saunders has fallen for it; that she is such a fool as a woman that she has fallen for the three-card trick the Aboriginal people in the local area have played. That was the essence of the argument of the honourable member for Barker. He said that there is no such thing as women's business; that this issue was produced by only one particular Aboriginal woman from that community at the point when the community realised it was going to lose the debate unless it came up with something new.

Every time they get up in debates such as this, they say, `Oh, yes, we respect the cultural and spiritual rights of Aboriginal people, but on this occasion they do not really exist.' I have been in this parliament for only 4 1/2 years&mdash;the same period as the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) has been here&mdash;and I have participated in a number of debates on issues affecting Aboriginal people. On only one occasion have I heard coalition members demonstrate some understanding of what is needed for the future, and that was on the issue of Aboriginal reconciliation. They supported the formation of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and I am pleased they did. It was an honourable decision they made. </PARA>

Since the passage of that bill and the formation of the council, on every single occasion that coalition members have been asked to address the issues and the principles of Aboriginal reconciliation&mdash;one of which is respect for the culture and spiritualty of Aboriginal people&mdash;they have failed. This is one more occasion on which they are doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even more amazing is that coalition members are doing it at a time when they do not even support the project that is involved.

I ask a valid question about the old Swan Brewery because the debate lasted for some time and is still ensuing in some ways: where was the minister at the time of the old Swan Brewery development?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of the treatment of evidence is also a matter of concern.

Of course, this is a matter of great sensitivity, but it is also a matter requiring the minister to make a very serious decision. In this case, the minister has extraordinary powers to make a declaration.

A teacher of mine once said that when you keep silent people may think you are stupid, but when you open your mouth they know for sure. In the few moments left to me, due to continual points of order, I note that there are a number of contradictions to the Saunders report. There are some differences between what Professor Saunders has asserted in her report and some of the evidence of previous authorities on Aboriginal settlement in the area in South Australia. I refer to Catherine and Ronald Berndt and Norman Tindale, who are recognised as three of the best anthropological authorities on Aboriginal culture around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it that Berndt and Tindale, acknowledged as authorities on Aboriginal anthropology, do not refer in any detail to the claims by the Ngarrindjeri women? Norman Tindale died in 1993 at the age of 93. He had devoted his whole life to researching Aboriginal history in South Australia and left his findings in the form of two tonnes of diaries and research notes to the South Australian people. These are housed in the South Australian Museum and were catalogued by the head of the anthropology section, Philip Jones, in 1989. There are approximately six volumes that refer to the Goolwa area. There is no mention in any of the six volumes of the significance of that area as suggested by the Ngarrindjeri women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister would have to concede that there is quite a substantial difference between the views of the women and the views of someone who was noted as a worldwide authority on Aboriginal anthropology. I am not an expert on Aboriginal anthropology and have never pretended to be. But, as someone who has had some basic training in assessing evidence, opinions and research, I would think that one would at least take note of the fact that there are differences of opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Berndts, in their book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The world that was</EMPHASIS>, refer to the River Murray as being like a lifeline, an immense artery of a living body which included country to the east: the legs spread south-eastward along the Coorong and south-west along Encounter Bay. However, the Berndts later refer to the fact that, due to the dispersal of clan remnants, visits to the lakes area were infrequent and, according to Karloan, an elder from the Yaraldi clan, the western leg of the lakes system, a symbolic body, was the first to wither. Why is a section of water, including the Goolwa channel, any different from other stretches of water in the lower Murray?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining the research that was provided to the minister with this advice one has to look also at the scale of events. The member for Barker referred in his contribution to this debate to the sequence of events. I referred earlier to the fact that in 1989 cabinet approved the bridge and proposal subject to submissions. In 1990, the Aboriginal Heritage Branch of the Department of Environment and Planning authorised the establishment of the marina as no Aboriginal sites would be affected by the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of note that at that particular time there appeared to be absolutely no questioning of the advice that the state Labor government received from its Aboriginal affairs section in relation to the proposal. The $64,000 question is: why is it that this declaration has been made with such alacrity by the minister? The minister in his contribution made little or no substantial reflection on his actions other than to make what I believe were petty personal attacks on members of the opposition for having the gall to disagree with him. The substance of the debate thus far from members on the other side of the chamber is that we have the gall to disagree with them; therefore we are either fools or have less than a satisfactory grasp of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am talking about some of the issues relating to the advice that the minister received. The minister said in his contribution that he did not rely on the sealed envelopes. I accept that and I have no reason to doubt that that is true. Bearing in mind that the sealed envelopes did have some special significance in relation to the report prepared by Professor Saunders, the minister basically said that he relied holus-bolus on Professor Saunders's report when making his decision to make a declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question that has to be asked is: why has the minister imposed a ban for only 25 years? That is something I do not understand as yet. I think the minister ought to answer that question.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if the matter were of such importance he would have made a permanent ban. Does it mean that the mythology will have evaporated after 25 years, or does it mean that the few remaining Ngarrindjeri women will no longer be alive then to pursue the tradition? That is another question the minister ought to answer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is amazing that the members of the opposition do not want any substantive issues raised in this debate. The report goes on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the most important site of all . . . represents a crucial part of Ngarrindjeri cultural beliefs about the creation and constant renewal of life along the lower Murray lakes, the Murray mouth and the Coorong . . . The cultural traditions concerning this `site', and its relationship to the surrounding lakes and Coorong, are highly confidential.</PARA>
<PARA>This report supports Professor Saunders's report to the minister. The issue of how seriously we need to take Aboriginal culture has a fairly long and established judicial history in this country. I refer to Justice Brennan's comments on the Tasmanian dams case under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983 in relation to the Kutikeena Cave issue. The phrase `particular significance' in section 8 cannot be precisely defined. This is what it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the site must be of a significance which is neither minimal nor ephemeral, and that the significance of the site may be found by the Aboriginal people in their history, in their religion or their spiritual beliefs or in their culture. A group of whatever size who, having a common Aboriginal biological history, find the site to be of that significance are the relevant people of the Aboriginal race for whom the law is made.</PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to Justice Wootton's comments on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritiage Protection Act 1984 relating to the Junction Waterhole dam in Alice Springs. Justice Wootton states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Act does not specify that any degree of antiquity must attach to the observances, customs and beliefs which may obviously change over time, although the word `tradition' in its ordinary meaning carries the notion of being handed down from generation to generation.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion concerns the oral tradition of the Ngarrindjeri people. It is very important to quote Dr Deane Fergie, who was referred to by the member for Barker. In her report to Professor Saunders, she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this case demonstrates the resilience of tradition in Aboriginal society. It also demonstrates the specificity and persistence of women's tradition in Aboriginal society.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to further refer to Justice Wootton's comments on the Junction Waterhole Dam because I believe it is relevant to the matters in this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the issue should not be whether, judged by the norms and values of our secular culture or our religions, the sites are important, but whether they are important to Aboriginals in terms of the norms and values of their traditional culture and beliefs. In other words, the issue is not whether we can understand and share the Aboriginal beliefs but whether knowing they are genuinely held, we can therefore respect them.</PARA>
<PARA>It is that respect and that attempt to understand the spiritual significance of these issues that is at the core of the matter. One of the issues that we have to take into consideration&mdash;here I refer to the points raised by the member for Braddon (Mr Miles)&mdash;is that, in the dispossession that was suffered by Aboriginal people in this country, their spiritual beliefs have been put under immense pressure. It is fascinating that this is often forgotten. The report by Cheryl Saunders contains elements which are fairly pertinent to this issue. Page 17 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drawing on Taplin's observations, Jenkins describes the Ngarrindjeri at the time of European contact as "a highly cultivated people", noting their craftsmanship and "dedication to cultural pursuits".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">European contact lead quickly to the spread of disease amongst Ngarrindjeri people. There is some evidence of contact by sealers and whalers as early as 1802. By the time Sturt arrived in 1830, these contacts were substantial. A smallpox epidemic ravaged the clans at about this time or even, possibly, before it. The first lease on Hindmarsh Island was taken out in the early 1840s and others followed soon after. The Ngarrindjeri people began to move away to Point McLeay (now Raukkan) where the Aboriginal Friends Association had opened a mission in 1859. Others were moved more forcibly. The Aborigines Act 1911 segregated the Aboriginal people into missions and reserves and gave the Protector unlimited powers over families. From 1923, the Protector had power to remove children from their parents and commit them to institutions. By 1913, the Ngarrindjeri effectively had been forcibly removed to Point McLeay. By the time this form of restrictive legislation was repealed, in 1962, several generations of the Ngarrindjeri people had grown up under this regime.</PARA>
<PARA>We should be amazed that the traditions and the spiritual meaning have been handed down from mother to daughter, as reported by Doreen Kartinyeri, about whom the member for Barker spoke. I could only perceive his comments to be in fairly disparaging terms. Who is Doreen Kartinyeri? Let me read once more from this report from Professor Cheryl Saunders, which is open and publicly available to everyone. She says that the substantive issues that are in the confidential documents, because they are women's business, do not change the information that she has been able to put in her report. Professor Saunders and Dr Fergie spent considerable time gaining the trust of Ngarrindjeri women, who came into this issue very late because they had not been consulted and did not know and because they were dispersed following the history that I have just mentioned. So the notion that they suddenly came into this matter late in the game to save the issue for the minister is an absolute nonsense; it is an absolute outrage to the women concerned. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doreen Kartinyeri is the key person in the Aboriginal Family History Unit of the South Australian Museum, which is nationally recognised for its work in enabling Aboriginal people to rediscover their families. She is a Ngarrindjeri elder, whose knowledge about "women's business" central to this report came from her grandmother and her Aunt Rosie, her mother's older sister. In turn, she passed on the knowledge to her daughters, in accordance with the traditions as she understood them, when they reached the appropriate age. The handing down of the knowledge within Doreen's family may have been assisted by the fact that her great-grandmother did not go into the mission, although Doreen herself did. Doreen Kartinyeri's work was recognised when she was named as the South Australian Aboriginal of the Year on 1st July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>These are the people who are being referred to in what I can only conclude are fairly disparaging terms by my colleagues opposite. What we have here is a very paltry attempt, once again, to raise a spectre of states rights over human rights in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be pleased and proud that, in the face of these considerable difficulties, the Ngarrindjeri women have been prepared to speak about very secret and ancient traditions to Professor Cheryl Saunders. This was done because they were faced with the fact that, were they not to do this, once again the rights, dignity and religious beliefs of Aboriginal people would be trodden on by people who had no respect for their ancient traditions. If reconciliation is to mean anything, it must take into account an increasing and growing understanding and respect for those traditions. We are not talking about ephemeral issues in the terms used by the member for Braddon; we are talking about an ancient religious tradition that is central to the welfare, wellbeing and future of Aboriginal people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will further quote from the report the concern about the release of secret information to people who traditionally, in terms of their culture, have no rights. Justice Wootton refers to this and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aborigines know that they must maintain secrecy, unless the release of that knowledge is perceived ultimately to be the only way to protect an area.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to quote Dr Fergie, who describes the compound problem as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Knowledge of the full significance of the sites and areas appears to have been confined to a small group of senior women who were all living in different and distant parts of South Australia and who for some time were unaware of the proposal to build a bridge to Hindmarsh Island. The dispersal of these few knowledgeable Ngarrindjeri was compounded by the fact that, until very recent months, it has been men rather than women who have been the central players in consultative and planning processes involving Aboriginal interests in this region. Men have dominated organisations such as the Ngarrindjeri Tendi, the Lower Murray Heritage Committee and the Ngarrindjeri Lands and Progress Association.</PARA>
<PARA>It took some time for the women to be brought together, and then they were not prepared to talk to people who were not able to be sensitive and concerned about women's issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you will know, serving as I do on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, that there have been many situations in other areas of the country where our committee has respected that, with some issues where men's business is to be discussed, it is not appropriate not to respect that cultural tradition; I certainly have been absent from those particular meetings. On the other hand, where women's business has been at issue, my male colleagues on that committee have been prepared to respect those traditions, and that has allowed me to participate in discussions with Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you would be aware from your own personal contact with Aboriginal people, I think it is certainly true that Aboriginal people&mdash;and we should not be surprised at this, given the history of genocide and oppression in this country&mdash;are not prepared to open their hearts without first gaining some trust in the individuals with whom they are prepared to communicate sacred and important information. I commend Professor Saunders for the way in which she went about her consultations with the elders of the Ngarrindjeri women's group. I believe that it is to the credit of the minister and this government that they have been prepared to take full cognisance of, and ensure that, the issues relating to women, who have been responsible for maintaining the traditions and the commitment of a dispossessed people, have been taken fully into account. </PARA>

On the subject of the veracity of Doreen Kartinyeri, I am not doubting that she believes what she says. Nobody seems to doubt that in any way at all. But, before the member leaves the chamber, I will read some words from Doreen Kartinyeri's own genealogy, which she wrote when given a grant via the Adelaide museum. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1979 Lewis O'Brien came to see me at my home and asked me if I could record Point McLeay and Point Pearce family genealogies and if I could would I be interested in doing a project to submit for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra. Next I could ask for a grant to record family genealogies, and he and Paul Hughes thought it should be recorded now. They both felt that the Aboriginal identity, culture, customs and language were fast dying out, and if it was not recorded now then it would be lost to our people forever. I told Lewis I didn't know much about the culture, customs and language but I said I do know the identities of the Point Pearce and Point McLeay people.</PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the member for Capricornia is leaving the chamber; this is a quote from the lady who is the custodian of all of this women's knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make sure that we are examining this on a reasonable and rational basis. Members opposite raised a number of times the fact that members on our side of the House, including the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and me, and Mr Dean Brown, the Premier of South Australia, had at various times said that we were not in favour of building the bridge. That is absolutely true. I have said any number of times that, in my view, it was a waste of government money. I did not mind if the Chapmans built the bridge, and when they ran out of money or were unable to do it that did not worry me one hoot. But, when the government was asked to put money into it, I felt there were better places to expend it&mdash;one of which was to build another bridge on the same river, further up at the town of Berri where the annual traffic every year is exactly double, and much more of it is commercial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put at rest the view that we are changing our view. Quite frankly, that is irrelevant compared with the enormity of this decision, which is that all of a sudden all of the previous systems can be overthrown by something that nobody can possibly comprehend. Nobody can possibly anticipate some issue that could turn up out of the air that overthrows all of the best laid plans of those people, costing them hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars after years of effort on their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but when it does turn up the minister will say, `We are not going to compensate you.' However, he managed to write to ATSIC saying, `If we are out of pocket, you can compensate me.' He made an unlawful suggestion, or a suggestion that ATSIC act unlawfully by compensating him. How on earth it could do that nobody could possibly contemplate. But you apparently contemplated that. My guess is that&mdash;and this is supposition&mdash;cabinet said to the minister, `You go ahead and do this as long as you are not out of pocket.' Do not forget that, in relation to the Swan Brewery, you said, `I have to ask cabinet.' You said, `It is 8 July. I have to make this declaration tomorrow. I will write a quick letter to Lois O'Donoghue today and ask her to compensate me,' which you did. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HT4">Mr McLACHLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which the minister did. She wrote back to the minister saying, `Yes, we will consider that at our next August meeting of ATSIC.' So you made a suggestion to her, as I said, which was unlawful. Not once did the minister address any of the debating points. I can only describe what he did as as he poured out this sanctimonious soup yet again by general or generic aspersions that anybody who disagrees with his point of view is virtually a racist&mdash;and the minister goes awfully close to saying that every time he gets up here at the box. You did it in the land acquisition fund debate many times. When anybody even says something remotely approaching that to this minister he jumps up and down here in a furious rage and takes points of order. You never debate the issue and you are always making generic references based on some form of sanctimony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised a number of issues which I will come to in a minute, none of which were referred to by the minister. He did not refer to the fact that the information about women's business seemed to come very late and that it was not all agreed to by all of the Aborigines. But let me raise one or two others that have been alluded to. Professor Saunders, who has been much praised by the government here today, never went near the Adelaide museum. I had that told to me by Mr Chris Anderson who runs that museum. He said, `Professor Saunders never came near us.' The Adelaide museum is a repository of all sorts of anthropological and other Aboriginal information and has been known to be for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Saunders failed, as has been mentioned, to take notice of any of the reference material written by Norman Tindale. As the minister knows, Norman Tindale worked with these people all over this country for many years. He retired to America. His work has been catalogued in part by Australians in Palo Alto in the USA. I think either earlier this year or late last year some large numbers of boxes of his personal and private notes were returned to the Adelaide museum, and some of the work that he did exactly countenanced this area. It was never referred to by the expert. She may be an expert, but in this particular matter that does not mean she is infallible, and that is the point I wish to make. Cheryl Saunders did not refer to Norman Tindale's Adelaide museum store of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, Ronald and Catherine Berndt did excellent work on the area, and have written a book which is very thick. Catherine Berndt, being a woman, you might have thought in all of that time might have heard of these women's issues or women's oral tradition, as it has been otherwise referred to, somewhere along the line in that area. She did not know of it. Her husband would not have known it, but she did not even know it or know of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Campbell family is one of the two families who were residents of Hindmarsh Island, which is the island we are talking about. The other family was the Pula family, the Pulami family. King Pulami was the king of the whole area. But Peter Campbell, four or five generations ago, was regarded as the man who ran Hindmarsh Island. Some members of the Campbell family disagree with the conclusions that the 35 women's group had come to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Dorothy Wilson went to this meeting and walked out of the meeting&mdash;this was not reported by Cheryl Saunders&mdash;and she came to the conclusion, very disappointedly and sadly, that it was fabricated. A member of the Campbell family, a male, said to me that he had checked with his mother and an elder Ngarrindjeri called Nanna Laura, and none of the older women who were not at this meeting&mdash;his mother has since died&mdash;knew of it. He said that they, some of these women, made sure that the locals could not get there. I do not know whether that is true or false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Everyone except our family managed to get there,' he said. `I could respect this matter if we were living in tribal tradition ways, but we are not. We've got to make sure that these things are fair dinkum. If we lie once then we have to lie and lie again,' he said to me on the phone only two days ago. Finally, he said, `Nothing what we've been told so far fits the shoe.' I agree: nothing we have been told so far fits the shoe. In regard to one of the people who was a descendant of King Pulami, Sarah Milera, he said, `Poor sister girl Sarah Milera believes it's true, but that doesn't make it true.' Again, he referred to the Berndt book and he said that this women's business is not even in the book written by the Berndts called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The way it was</EMPHASIS>. Some would have thought that all of this would have been in the Campbell's family history at the Adelaide museum. It will be interesting to see in fact whether it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to come back to the matters I raised with the minister in the first instance, and they were fourfold. One matter is whether or not this parliament should be asked to make a judgment when the evidence that is proffered is not all able to be seen by the parliament. Until such time as we are able to do that, then I suggest that we should reject this declaration. That is why I have moved in this way. I repeat what Justice Michael Kirby said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not feasible to present to the parliament, for blind adoption, unstated secret rules, the very existence of which could not be recounted to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the essence of my problem. The essence of my problem is that I am here to vote and I am not allowed to see the evidence&mdash;not that I want to see the evidence particularly if it is women's business, but neither is Minister Laidlaw and Minister Barbara Weise, because, presumably, nobody knew of its existence at that time. Yet Doreen Kartinyeri is an educated, intelligent woman. She knew this matter was going on for years in the press. She could have come forward with that information much earlier than 12 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter is that I categorically asked the minister whether or not he had acted unlawfully. The minister absolutely refused to answer that question in regard to ATSIC. He did not even comment on the subject. I said to you that you could not suggest to ATSIC that it repay you if you made a mistake, because the only way that you could be successfully sued is if you had acted unlawfully; and there is nothing in the ATSIC Act which enables them to repay you if you acted either lawfully or unlawfully. So you will have to produce that letter, which we understand you have up until now refused to produce, no doubt in some other place. Nevertheless, on the public record in open court is Lois O'Donoghue's reply to you saying that you had demanded some compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the minister categorically refused to answer the question as to whether he had seen or been told of the contents of the sealed attachments to Dr Fergie's report. There is a good reason perhaps why you refused to do that: you know that if you had, in Aboriginal terms, that would have been a profanity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first occasion that I have had the opportunity to speak in this parliament on family law matters. Today we are debating very sensible and well thought out amendments to the Family Law Act. I take this opportunity to put on record my view that the Family Law Act when it was introduced was, and remains, one of the best examples of far-sighted reform coming from this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last sitting week, the House passed legislation which will stop police poking and peeping into citizens' bedrooms in Tasmania. Senator Lionel Murphy's Family Law Act did the same in 1975 with regard to private detectives peeping into bedrooms with cameras prior to the introduction of non-fault divorce. Lionel Murphy was a great Australian. The Family Law Act is only one of the lasting monuments to Lionel Murphy. Lionel Keith Murphy's legacy will remain while many of the so-called leaders of the coalition who not so long ago tried to vilify him are long forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion of the Family Law Council is that the language of family law has been drawn from criminal and property law. Unfortunately, these concepts remain in the minds of the users of family law. In my experience as a legal practitioner, try as I might, I could never convince the majority of my clients that the issue of custody of their children was separate from the issue of maintenance. Now this legislation removes the concepts of custody and access and introduces the concepts of parental responsibility, parenting plans and parenting agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, these changes have been criticised by Mr Justice Joske in a submission to the joint committee dealing with family law matters. His Honour argued that confusion would arise because, under the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, the terms `custody' and `access' are used. He argued that confusion about custody and guardianship arise in the community as a result of what terms are perceived to mean in fact rather than the result of legal labels. I would agree to some extent that there is certainly confusion in the community over the differences between the concepts of custody and guardianship, but I would say that the confusion is both in terms of law and often in terms of fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the concept of joint guardianship is not well understood in the community. Quite often, when matters of family law come before the courts, one party is given custody and joint guardianship goes with that. It is not something that is emphasised by courts yet, as I say, when people walk away from the Family Court or the Magistrate's Court that has given them some sort of custody, all that remains in their minds is that they have custody of the child. Unfortunately, some people see their children as being possessions; therefore, the concept of joint guardianship is alien to them. They cannot contemplate sharing their possession with an estranged spouse or partner. But because there is little or no understanding of the law&mdash;and in some cases not even an acceptance of the law&mdash;this reform is necessary. It is much better to address, as this bill does, parenting agreements which reflect the reality of society's conception rather than enforce some ill-defined joint guardianship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of guardianship itself is a little out of date. It is mainly used in state legislation relating to ex-nuptial children. Thankfully, most of this legislation has now been replaced. In my view, the word `guardianship' should be disregarded from our family law language. I looked up the word `custody' in the dictionary and found the word `keeping', which certainly implies possession. Yet, when the Family Court, or perhaps the Magistrate's Court, awards custody, it does not intend now to give something to one party to the exclusion of the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confusion and resentment almost certainly follow when access is awarded to the other party. That is also not understood. Mr Justice Joske also took the view that parents are normally possessive about their children and that attitudes will not be changed by terminology. I agree with that, but I would go further and say that no law in any form will change everybody's attitude. These changes provide a framework for the carrying out of those principles that society at this point sees as most appropriate. The law can never be expected to be a substitute for compassion and commonsense in all cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a legal practitioner, I remember vividly spending several hours with an estranged couple who refused to agree on what half of Christmas Day each party would have access to the children. This dispute took hours. They could not agree who would get the morning and who the afternoon. The law can never totally solve a relationship of that level&mdash;especially one involving children&mdash;where the parties cannot even come to a basic agreement like that. No lawyer, court or legal terminology could ever solve such a basic and fundamental breakdown in communication and tolerance between two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Counselling can be a great help in these situations. This legislation greatly enhances the capacity of the Family Court and other courts that administer the family law to involve counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the structure of parenting agreements following counselling is the best model for reflecting the principles of tolerance and understanding together with the very important principle that the best interests of the child are paramount. This language reflects the language of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. That is why the bill refers to parental responsibility. It is very significant that in this legislation there is no reference to the rights of parents, because a reference to their rights would imply some sort of property rights over the children. But the concept of parental responsibility is important in relation to the financial maintenance of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed new section 61C(2) provides that each of the parents will continue to have parental responsibility for the child, despite any change in the nature of their relationship, including whether they become separated, married or remarried. Under proposed new section 63B, parents are encouraged to agree about matters concerning their children rather than seek an order from the court. A parenting plan may deal with a person or persons with whom the child is to live, contact between the child and other persons, the maintenance of the child and any other aspects of parental responsibility of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that this legislation makes that link between maintenance of the child and other parental responsibilities, because that has always been the reality. As I said earlier, the law quite often has made that separate, and for very sensible reasons. But the reality is that they are connected in people's minds and we cannot ignore that. That is why this legislation, by adopting a parenting plan, adopts the proper balance between these responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who a child lives with is an important issue. Quite often, disputes are not about where a child is to live but whether a present third party is perhaps seen as a bad influence on the child. They are the sorts of things that can be determined in parenting plans. Every other aspect of the parental responsibility of a child is very important, because parents may want to make agreements about issues such as the education and religion of the child. Under this bill, the court can only set aside the parenting plan if it is obtained by fraud, duress or undue influence with the consent of the parties or, very importantly, if the court concludes that it is in the best interests of the child to not set aside the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives power to make orders where appropriate to include step-parents in the parenting plan. This does not diminish the parental responsibility of natural parents, but in relation to maintenance it does allow the court to give step-parents some financial responsibility for children who are in their care and control. This is very significant because again it reflects reality. I emphasise that it does not diminish the responsibility of the natural parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, since the Family Law Act was drafted and introduced in the 1970s, we have had most significant reforms in the area of child support. Although there have been very obvious administrative problems with child support, the concept that natural parents should be financially responsible for their children and that, if necessary, there should be state intervention to ensure that that is the case is very important and it will obviously be very complementary to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) and the Joint Select Committee on Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act on this bill. The Family Law Council also reported on guardianship, custody and access and made comparisons with the British legislation. What came out of that was that this legislation is leading the world in this area. We in Australia can be very proud that sometimes we pick the best out of overseas legislation. That is certainly what happened in Australia with the Family Law Act. When Lionel Murphy first drafted that act, similar provisions had just been enacted in the United</PARA>
<PARA>Kingdom. We came out with better legislation, and this has happened here again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged that this is not the end of the reform process. I understand that the joint select committee has put up other matters that it obviously wants to press with the government. The values of society change quite often, and these values must be reflected in the family law. The family law will not be static. These matters will be covered in the course of further scrutiny by the joint select committee and other committees of this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very significant that, when people are surveyed in opinion polls these days, they quite often do not refer so much to matters of unemployment or matters of an economic base as being important in their lives. Quite often they refer to personal relationships. Quite often they say that that is what they see as affecting their lives and they look to governments for assistance. That also comes through in Hugh Mackay's connotative research. People feel that a change in society is somewhat threatening and they often look to the government for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that this legislation is part of the government's response to that. It is a very appropriate response because it reflects the fact that society now believes that children are not possessions. There should be an obligation on both parents to come up with an appropriate plan for the care and control of the children. There could not be a topic that has had more public input and parliamentary input than this one. Therefore, I am putting to the House that there is no reason whatsoever to send this legislation to another Senate committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot underestimate the importance of this legislation. It will take away a bit of the heat that people face during the difficult time when their marriages or relationships break up. I do not want to overemphasise that point because there is obviously heat in those situations and nothing the law will do will change the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation strengthens the principle of looking out for the best interests of children, so why on earth does the coalition want to delay it any further? Why on earth do those opposite want to send this legislation off to a parliamentary committee in another place? I suspect that it is another example of the grubby political opportunism that we see from the coalition. Once again it is another example of how an opposition works under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see any reason for another committee report into these matters. I do not want to exaggerate the point, but people are suffering. These changes are very sensible. Why deprive the people of Australia the opportunity of working with a new and better Family Law Act? That will be the effect of any coalition delay with the legislation. I wholeheartedly support the Family Law Reform Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite clearly the previous speaker, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), misunderstands why the opposition wants to examine further some aspects of the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2]. I do not dispute that there was a quite long, involved and very worthwhile inquiry. My only regret&mdash;and the name of the inquiry reflects this point&mdash;is that the inquiry looked at certain aspects of the Family Law Act. It seems to me that there is still time for a complete overhaul of the Family Law Act. The whole ethos and basis of existence of the Family Law Act has been brought into question in a number of important respects since it was first introduced in 1975. In practice it simply does not work very well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone in this place could seriously advocate going back to pre-1975 and the spectre of being required to prove fault. There is an imbalance here. We have somehow lost the plot and effectively made divorce easier. There needs to be a balance, and I am not advocating that we go too far to one side or the other. By law we have made divorce easier. The enormous hike in the number of divorces that have occurred post-1975 indicates that we have facilitated divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, over there, will argue that that is a good thing. In my view it is not necessarily a good thing. The other thing that you on the other side of the House have done is, in an economic sense, facilitate the break-up of marriage. When speaking in the debate about the Social Security (Parenting Allowance and Other Measures) Amendment Bill yesterday I mentioned your headlong rush to create a welfare state in this country. Once again you have made it possible for people to separate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The honourable member for McPherson might note that the chair has not made it possible for people to separate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has made it possible for people to leave relationships easily. Once again, that is the purpose of the government's policy. I think there may be some sort of balance there, but the government cannot argue that that has not occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Leichhardt mentioned the amount of interest there is in this subject. This interest is reflected in the number of members on the speakers list. This interest is also reflected in the number of complaints that we get through our offices. In my experience, the complaints come equally from men and women who feel that they are somehow disadvantaged by the operation of the law, whether it be the operation of the Family Law Act or the operation of the Child Support Agency. These things give rise to an enormous number of complaints from men and women. In terms of complaints, one side does not outnumber the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an area of great concern. My view, which is well known in this place, is that we ought to be doing everything we can to support families, to keep families together. Yet, from my understanding, this particular legislation and indeed many of the government's economic policies have had exactly the opposite effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking in this debate as a non-lawyer, although I understand that the former speaker is a lawyer. Plenty of lawyers will contribute to this debate. However, my colleague on the other side of the chamber the member for Chifley (Mr Price) is not a lawyer. So a number of non-lawyers will also be contributing but it will be a fertile debate for lawyers. They will argue from a legal point of view about some technical aspects of the law as it is proposed. It is quite legitimate that that sort of debate should occur as we are concerned that we get this right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process has been going on for some time. The government has actually contributed to the delay. A bill was introduced into this House some time back, but it was subsequently withdrawn. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Dodd" NAMEID="EV5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are facilitating it up to a point, but you have contributed to the delays. You made the point that we are delaying the legislation, but it so happens that there are aspects of this bill that we are not satisfied with&mdash;despite the good work of the committee, chaired by the honourable member for Chifley. So often we see this government rushing into this place when it wants to make a political statement or do another political stunt, which is what a lot of legislation actually ends up being. The government then comes back the next week, the next month or the next year to fix up the problems it created and the unintended consequences. So let us get this right. What is happening to families and relationships is too important to us as a nation for us not to do this properly. It is also some time since the report was brought down&mdash;I think it was in the previous parliament&mdash;and things can change. So there is every reason for proper investigation to be going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that we have to legislate ways of raising children when marriages break down. Children are ultimately the innocent victims of marriage breakdown. All of our experience would tell us that they are the ones most affected. Kids do not easily get over divorces. I saw some statistics recently that showed that even five years after their parents had divorced a significant number of children were still suffering the psychological effects. In other words, some were suffering severe depression and other related disorders as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divorce is not like the flu or a cold, something kids just get over. They do not get over divorce. Many of them carry the scars of their parents' divorce throughout their lives and it colours their own relationships and their own marriages to some extent down the track. It is a fact of life and, therefore, the law has to address the issues involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriage breakdown, and the family breakdown which is directly related to it, is a big problem in Australia. It would be much better if we as legislators could implement ways of addressing the problems that actually cause family breakdown. As I have suggested, I believe there are a lot of ways of doing that. Unfortunately, most of the things the Whitlam government did and this government has done have had exactly the opposite effect&mdash;to facilitate family breakdown instead of actually looking for ways to address the core problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often hear people talking about the rate of divorce in our country having escalated, depending on how it is measured. I was reading recently that the good news is that most marriages appear to survive. In 1992, 7.7 million Australians were living in registered marriages, and 90 per cent of those people were in their first marriages. On that basis, only 10 per cent of those first marriages had broken up. Often divorce rates appear to be overstated as they are a comparison of the number of marriages and the number of divorces in any one year. The large number of divorces which occur from second and third marriages breaking up tends to be reflected in and distort those figures if they are looked at just on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point worth making is that the traditional family is alive and well. We often hear all sorts of talk that there is no such thing any more as a traditional or nuclear family. In fact, 86 per cent of all families in existence in Australia at the moment are couple families; they may or may not have children, but a traditional family relationship exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely recognised that one of the key causes of marriage breakdown is financial pressure. A recent study found that one in eight traditional families is now living below the poverty line. It is quite clear that the tax system has discriminated against those families&mdash;I assume intentionally, because it is evident in the figures&mdash;in the last 10 years. Those families are living below the poverty line despite the fact that, in most cases, at least one parent is working. The same study also found that the nuclear family was one of the groups hardest hit by Labor's decade of economic mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is testament to the fact that marriage breakdown is a major problem in Australian society. There is no doubt that the current Family Law Act as a whole, particularly the Child Support Agency which flows from it, has plenty of room for improvement. I am sure that every member of this House is regularly approached by people who feel the system has let them down badly. Some of those people are extremely angry and frustrated by the extent to which the law as it exists has let them down. We see evidence of that every day. When we look at their problems as they are presented to us in our offices, there is no doubt that it would take more than the wisdom of Solomon to come up with a solution that would be acceptable to both parties in situations where goodwill has often completely broken down and there is no normal communication between the two parties. Like most members, my Family Court and Child Support Agency files are amongst the largest files I have got in my office. They detail a lot of very sad cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently conducted a school essay competition in my electorate. One of the essayists, 16-year-old Darren Bridges, who goes to Somerset College in my electorate, summed the situation up very well. The topic for the essay was related to the International Year of the Family and the sorts of things governments should be doing for families. Darren wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The statistic that divorce has trebled since 1970 is an alarming one. However if, in some cases, divorce is the only option then the government should encourage couples to move away from lengthy and expensive legal battles over custody and set up an easily accessed system of mediation&mdash;a more suitable way of sorting out human relationships than the current confrontational approach.</PARA>
<PARA>I think there would be general agreement to that suggestion from members on both sides of the House. This legislation goes down that track. The coalition recognises that the government is attempting to prompt an attitudinal change with this legislation. It is not easy to achieve such a change through the law; it needs to be achieved in other ways, such as through the education system. But still, to the extent that the law is attempting to do that, we support it. The government is attempting to move away from a confrontationist system and to give both parties to a broken relationship more control and responsibility for the parenting of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that parental responsibility is a vital ingredient in the successful raising of children. I have never had any doubt about the fact that children need both parents. Yet some of the commentary on the existing situation regarding families and single parents says that it does not matter; kids can be raised in any sort of relationship. It does not matter if children are raised by single parents; two parents of the same sex is almost an option on the agenda these days. All of the evidence I have ever seen&mdash;it has never been refuted&mdash;is that children fare best when they are brought up in a stable, intact two-parent family, with one of the parents being a man and the other a woman; quite obviously, that is what I am saying in that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the evidence points to the desirability of intact families for the sake of children. Anything else we talk about here today has to be seen as a second best solution to a problem which inevitably will arise to some extent in our society today. But, as I say, in my view it does not necessarily have to arise to the extent to which it is arising if other government policies are in place and the education system is such that marriage as an institution is put back on the pedestal where it used to be. The fact that it has fallen down is one of the underlying problems we have in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is now being touted as part of the reason for some of these changes. All family members have rights and responsibilities. The problem with the trendy nature of our rushing headlong into United Nations conventions is that they are all big on rights. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child talks a lot about rights but does not really canvass responsibilities, which are the other side of the coin. If families are to work properly, there has to be within the education system a basis for understanding marriage as an institution where every family member has rights and responsibilities. In the end I do not know whether you can legislate parental responsibility; in this particular bill, we are attempting to facilitate it in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, a parenting plan sounds to me like a bureaucratic solution to the problem. We will have to see how it works. I am sure the member who will be speaking after me will tell us that it is working well in the UK and that is the model for it. We will see how it works here. It is difficult to produce attitudinal behavioural changes in a hostile family environment, and that ultimately is my concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition shares the concerns of the Law Council that this legislation ends up involving the court to a greater extent in that, while it does not scrutinise consent orders and parenting plans, they are given the full weight of a court order. That is one of the reasons, incidentally, why we would like the bill referred for consideration to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to see, as the Law Council suggests, that both parties will need to receive independent legal advice before allowing these parenting plans to be registered with the court. It is also easy to see that these new arrangements will really only work where there is some degree of goodwill between both parties. Without that, it is difficult to see how these particular arrangements will work. Clearly, where a relationship has deteriorated to a large extent this new terminology and these new arrangements will not improve the situation at all. There will still be lengthy court disputes, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support broadly the principles and aims of the bill, although I do so rather reluctantly. From my point of view, as I said earlier, it is really up to the government to address the root causes of marriage breakdown. More attention to some of those causes would solve a lot of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said during a debate yesterday, the government has created a welfare state in this country. I referred in that debate to figures which point absolutely conclusively to that: in 1971 the primary source of income of 10 per cent of the population was government welfare; now it is almost 30 per cent. We now have 4.4 million Australians relying completely on the government for their income. That is a deplorable situation and not at all desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more people have been trapped in the welfare net and are no longer able or encouraged to take responsibility for their own lives. Responsibility surely is one of the keys to social cohesion. Yet it seems to me that this government&mdash;I am not sure whether it comes from its socialist philosophy&mdash;is all about taking individual responsibility away from people. While it continues to do that, we will continue to have the problems we are addressing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly believe that counselling is a very desirable way of enabling people to solve problems and that premarital counselling should be more widely available. I know my colleague at the table on our side, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), has spoken a lot about the need to improve access to counselling, particularly premarital counselling. It is very surprising&mdash;I think the committee probably had evidence of this put before it&mdash;how little premarital counselling is taken advantage of by couples intending to marry. It should be encouraged or even made mandatory, although I do not know in practice how that would work for those who are intending to marry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in many respects the existing mediation procedures have provided exactly the wrong sort of counselling. I think it is generally recognised that, by the time people enter formal mediation, the whole intention seems to be to help them further the cause of breaking up their relationship rather than attempting to counsel them on ways of getting it back together. Therefore, in my view, that has the wrong foundation completely. It may be that the extension of counselling facilities will be worth while. While there is something basically wrong with the institution of marriage, while it is no longer sacred and it no longer confers special privileges and responsibilities upon those who enter into it, it may well end up being a lost cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a letter in my local paper yesterday which I think sums up people's attitudes to what is happening in our society. A lady writes that, after looking back over 65 years of life, she can see a constant crumbling of our society and its institutions&mdash;and amongst them is marriage. Marriage used to be important and sacred to people. It used to be, as I said earlier, on a pedestal. When it ceases to be that, that is one of the fundamental reasons for the problems in our society. Families are the foundation of our society. Strong families make a nation strong. When our foundations crumble, what becomes of our society? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am thankful for the opportunity to speak in support of the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2]. I want to start off with an apology. Firstly, I place on record the encouragement and support that members on both sides of this House have given to my committee in its child support inquiry. It is a matter of regret that we have not yet tabled that report. Whilst we have missed some deadlines, I think it reasonable to expect if all goes well that we will table the report at the end of the month or the first week in December. Those members who have so strongly encouraged and supported the committee's work will not be disappointed by the work of the committee. I acknowledge their contribution as well as that of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I should get out of the way my disappointment that the opposition is referring this bill to a Senate committee. I think the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) made a fair point when he suggested that the primary task of the family law committee ought to be to complete the child support inquiry. We also have a second reference into the funding and administration of the Family Court. I will refer to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) made a few points to which I must strongly respond. I am not sure whether he was aware of the implications of what he said. Firstly, he said that we should make it more difficult for people in marriages to split up. I do not share that view. Basically, the statistics show that it is now women who are walking out of relationships. I do not believe the government is facilitating that in any way, but I do not think it helpful to make it harder for those women to walk out of the relationships. Either the relationship is sound and can be maintained or it has disintegrated. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that maybe he did not intend to say that, but I do not think it fair to single out women as the cause of marriage breakdowns. I am very disappointed that all our government money goes into the collateral end of marriages and breakdowns. None is there to assist to overcome the ups and downs. But, even if we had a very active program, we would still find a high rate of marriage breakdown. I certainly acknowledge that as a major shortcoming. Frankly, in the International Year of the Family, it is something that needs to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think every member on this side of the House strongly supports the view that families should be supported and that marriages and relationships should continue for as long as possible, if not infinitely. But the reality is that people do dissolve these relationships and we ought to accept it. We need to satisfy ourselves as parliamentarians that, without creating artificial barriers, we have done everything by way of providing counselling and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly reject the view that it is somehow government action or policy to want to put financial pressure on marriages and/or relationships and therefore the government is responsible. I think it is a function of our society. In a very male dominated chamber, I venture the view that some of these male attitudes about marriages and relationships really need to be changed radically if we are going to see longevity in marriages and relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I support the bill, I do not feel that it goes far enough in the family law area. I acknowledge the good work of the previous committee. I acknowledge that the government is picking up that committee's recommendations and I congratulate it. But I do not think it is going far enough. Why would I say that? Let me give you a few examples. I was staggered to learn that the increased funding for the Family Court over a 10-year period has been dramatic. I think most members of this House would be aware of the chief justice from time to time saying on television that he desperately needs more money for more initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding for the Family Court from 1981-82 to 1991-92 increased by not 50 per cent, not 100 per cent, not 200 per cent, not 300 per cent, not 400 per cent, but by 572 per cent. That is a staggering increase in funding for any institution, whether it be the Family Court or a government department. The thing that would disturb most members of parliament is that we cannot see that there is a 572 per cent better outcome in terms of access and quality of decision making. I think the Family Court has a real problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the Attorney-General's Department, for example, is responsible for the Family Court's buildings. I say to the Attorney-General's Department that I do not believe there is any correlation between the grandeur of the building in which it houses the Family Court and the quality of people's access and justice to that court. I was privileged to go to New Zealand as a guest of the New Zealand government. I dropped in to see the chief justice of the family court. To my surprise I found New Zealand did not have a separate family court. It was all part of the general division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I walked into the court, I found that it was a very modest court, very small, very intimate. Some judges did not even sit on a bench; they sat with the parties. I think we ought to see more of that. They were ordinary judges with a federal warrant. That raises the question&mdash;and I think this is one of the challenges for my committee: do we need a special Family Court or should it be part of the Federal Court with a special family law warrant? I think that is an issue that needs to be addressed. It has the immediate benefit that the judges themselves are not constantly dealing with Family Court issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I want to say, very passionately I hope, is that we failed in the child support inquiry on the issue of custody and access. This is one of the big unsolved problem areas in family law. I do not think you are going to get much joy from the committee's report on child support. I am certainly keen to undertake the matter in the funding and the administration of the Family Court inquiry. The biggest problem, with great respect to some of my lawyer friends, is that it is all right for the Attorney or for the lawyers to say that the citizens of Australia have legal rights. Indeed they do. I have been absolutely shocked at the amount of money that people spend on their legal advice in family law matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Attorney-General's Department: it is about time you or the Family Court started gathering some statistics about this matter so that people can see the dimension of the problem that we are picking up anecdotally. The problem is that, by the time they have gone through their property settlement and their custody and access issues, there is no more money. It is all very well to say that if access has broken down people can go back to the court, but they have not got the money to go back to the court. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bradford" NAMEID="FT4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McPherson points out the situation of legal aid. We are running out of legal aid. What is the quality of justice in this country if some people get legal aid but we say to others, `Sorry, the budget is not good. You cannot get legal aid'? Does someone not have to say that we need another process?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to take people's legal rights away from them, but I say that we are in a hypocritical position where we talk about people's rights to justice and rights to the Family Court but they cannot exercise them. Something has to give. Something has to change. No changes in this bill are going to go towards solving that problem. I know the bill talks about alternative dispute resolution problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and his departmental officials to the situation in New Zealand where counselling and mediation are organised by the court. You go to the court, but no court officer provides the counselling. It is all provided by outside organisations, thus overcoming part of the problem of the independence of the judiciary that the honourable member for Tangney referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More interestingly, that mediation and counselling is not solely focused on collapsed relationships. A significant proportion of the focus is on people who are in difficulties, who recognise that they are in difficulties and who want some assistance to work it through. It is shameful in Australia that the Family Court is unable to provide that and that there is no equivalent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a difficulty in understanding why we do not say that judges, when dealing with children, are best placed to decide the health regime to fix a child's illness, and that judges are best placed to decide an education program to develop a child's talents&mdash;big decisions in a child's life but we do say, magically, that it is the judiciary that can decide which parent should accept what responsibility. What is it about judges that gives them this insight? I know that they are good with property and with commercial law, and I understand their role, but I do not understand their primary role in human relationships. I have suggested that we ought to look at&mdash;I hope the funding and administration inquiry will consider this&mdash;whether or not we can develop a no-frills tribunal as an alternative to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, people will have the option of going there. They will not go to any of the grand buildings that are taxpayer funded to the extent of millions of dollars. It could be a round table discussion. It could be at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock at night. It could even operate on Saturdays and Sundays so people could actually get there. Its process could be one of attempted conciliation. Maybe 60 per cent of the decision making could be conciliated and the rest arbitrated. We need to look at this sort of micro reform in the Family Court area to try to provide a degree of equity and access to justice. If we are going to talk about a reform program, this is the sort of thing we need to devote some attention to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department sought its third extension before putting a submission into the inquiry. I must say, I am looking forward to that submission. I hope and trust that it will be more substantial than the contribution it made to the child support inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people feel that putting television cameras into courtrooms, or even taking wigs off, is substantial law reform. Whilst I would not deprecate those moves, they go nowhere near giving men and women in Australia access to justice. People can test what we mean by access and equity. If they can get into a court with legal representation, it passes the test; if they cannot, it fails the test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will always be a certain number of cases that will be highly contentious and will need to be fought out in a legal area. There are also a lot of ordinary Australians who wish on an equal basis to have their disputes resolved by a non-adversarial method. Some proposals in this bill go some way to that. I also suggest that it is worth while looking at that so-called no-frills family tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make one final observation. I have said publicly that fixing the child support area is only fixing an end point in the separation trail. With all its twists and turns, we have a long way to go. I hope this bill will make a significant contribution. I certainly hope the reference that both houses have been pleased to give my committee on the funding and administration of the Family Court will equally make a contribution. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a tough job. But there is a third area we really need to look at, and I believe it is the community area. The fact is that this government is no longer funding any new legal centres. There are dispersed community based advice services for families dealing with such things as financial counselling&mdash;and I have to say that I much prefer to see mediation out there in the community sector. But we need to have a good look at the community sector, at what it is currently doing and what it possibly could do in the future in this difficult area. We do not have a reference that covers this. I hope that, after we table the report into the child support inquiry, both houses of parliament will see fit to give us that third reference, which I think would deal with all those difficult areas in family law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not want people to be in any doubt. I certainly do support this bill and the changes it makes. It was unfortunate that the previous committee did not look at the United Kingdom children's act. I must congratulate the Attorney-General on taking the initiative to have the act reviewed and on bringing down many of the changes that are represented in this bill. I place on record my thanks to the Attorney-General for picking up the recommendations of the previous committee and implementing them in the main. I hope it will not be too long before I am able, on the committee's behalf, to table the report on the child support scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for the sentiments that he expressed during his speech to the parliament. I agree with virtually everything he said. The Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2] is about heartbreak and agony. It is about people. It is about the dissolution of families. It needs an enormous amount of consideration by this parliament. It is the first of two separate bills to come before the House relating to family law. This one relates to mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution and to children. The second bill, which is due to be introduced this session&mdash;the government had better get a move on, I would suggest; the session is nearly over&mdash;will deal with matrimonial property.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly concerned with the provision of alternative dispute resolution. The bill will amend part II, marriage counselling organisations; part III, counselling and reconciliation; and part IIIA, mediation and arbitration, of the Family Law Act. It will seek to facilitate greater use of mediation, counselling and arbitration and the resolution of family law disputes, both in the court and in approved organisations in the community, and provide for approval mechanisms, community based counselling and mediation organisations to become approved mediation and/or counselling organisations under the act, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the thrust of the bill is exemplary, without the money to back it up it is a waste of time. As member for Cowper, I have been seeking for quite some time to get additional funding for the Family Court so that counselling services can be established on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, specifically in Coffs Harbour, where in May a branch of the Family Court opened. I have been in correspondence with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan). In his most recent letter to me he said that he shared my concern that it was important that regional centres have access to the same services as are provided in major metropolitan areas. I do not quibble with that; of course he does. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is responding to the need for counselling services in the Coffs Harbour region. As part of its family services program, the government is providing funding to the Family Life Movement of Australia to undertake marriage counselling through its family life centres, including its centre in Coffs Harbour.</PARA>
<PARA>That is correct, it is true and it is highly commendable. The family life unit in Coffs Harbour received $173,702 in the last financial year to provide marriage and family counselling and family mediation plus a very small amount of marriage education in the area including Port Macquarie&mdash;that is, the Hastings Valley&mdash;Kempsey and the Macleay Valley, the Nambucca Valley, the Bellingen Valley, Coffs Harbour, the Clarence Valley and Grafton, and the northern tablelands of New South Wales, including Armidale, Glen Innes and Tenterfield. To do all of that they have three full-time staff, only one of whom is a full-time counsellor, three part-time staff and seven sessional counsellors. In 1993-94 they conducted 2,200 interviews&mdash;mainly in Coffs Harbour, a small number in Grafton, none in the tablelands, none in the Hastings or the Manning or the Nambucca, and none in Bellingen or Dorrigo. Incidentally, there are no counselling services in Taree or the Great Lakes area either. There is a crying need for such services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must make it clear that my main concern with Coffs Harbour generally is that there are not enough Family Court counsellors. The Family Life Movement is doing a great job, particularly in Coffs Harbour under the management of Betty Judd. I commend her and all of the people associated with her, but they do not have the funding to go virtually anywhere outside Coffs Harbour. The same thing applies to the Family Court. As I said, my main concern is that there are not enough Family Court counsellors. The registrar in charge of the Family Court at Coffs Harbour has advised that there are presently 79 matters waiting for trial dates in Coffs Harbour and that at the next circuit 114 fresh matters are to be dealt with by the court. The court has circuits every six weeks, so every six weeks there are approximately 100 new matters coming on line. The enormous volume of litigation in this area cannot be managed adequately without skilled counsellors to deal with the more difficult matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the initial funding to Family Life will assist, but the problem in this area is that we are dealing with poverty-stricken families, where the abuse of children is more prevalent than in some other areas. In fact, the chief justice has highlighted this area as one of the major priorities for additional funding. But, unless the government can see its way fit to provide the funding, all the rhetoric in the world is going to achieve nothing. To reinforce that, the response I had from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General&mdash;which stated that Family Life will be given additional funding&mdash;does not address the basic problem that we have in Coffs Harbour, namely, that highly dysfunctional families are litigating and we do not have adequate counselling facilities to assist them and the children through the litigation process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise the importance of the children in this. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) have often heard me say that the `p' in `politics' stands for people and that the `p' in `parliament' stands for people but, above all, in this matter it stands for children and, as I said earlier, the heartbreak, agony and corrosiveness experienced by human beings because of this family breakdown. It is important that additional funding be supplied. I would like to quote from a speech the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Sir Alistair Nicholson, gave when opening the sixth national family law conference on 17 October. Whilst speaking on alternative dispute resolution, the chief justice said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a major plank of its legislative program, the Government has announced that the whole thrust of the Act will be altered in the direction of alternative dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>What a good thing. That is why we are here today. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach is to be welcomed and is in accordance with the views of the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is a danger that what has occurred to date will become lost in the rhetoric. In a sense, the announced change of approach does not do justice to what has been achieved by the Government and its predecessors, or by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the nub of it. We are talking about justice&mdash;not just doing justice to what has been achieved, but providing justice for our fellow Australians. The chief justice continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is too easily forgotten that the Court Counselling Service has been operating as an integral part of the Court since its inception, that the Court's Registrars have similarly been involved from the inception of the Court in the conciliation of property matters and that less than 5% of cases ever require a final judicial determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also should be remembered&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I do give praise where praise is due, as does the chief justice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that this approach is far in advance of that adopted by any Court in Europe and that only a few States of the USA have the facility of an in-house counselling service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mediation model adopted by the Court is a very particular type of mediation, its main distinguishing features being the fact that it is entirely voluntary, entirely non-directive and the mediators are a combination of professionally trained lawyers and social scientists, working together.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite important. But, without the funding to do it, it is not going to happen. There is insufficient funding for the counsellors, whom we need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chief justice, when talking about court funding, also said in his address to the annual judges meeting on 13 October 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court finished the financial year with a slight overspend . . . Measures are, I believe, in hand to correct the situation, which has largely been caused by high staff levels. The reduction in these levels will involve some pain so far as Court services are concerned . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: so far as court services are concerned; that is, the services being provided to the families of Australia who need them. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this being an inevitable concomitant of the so called efficiency dividend, which is in reality a compulsory and recurring cut in Court funding of approximately $.4M each year.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that it was $450,000 in the present year. Year after year, the court is having to cut back by $400,000 or $450,000. Every time that happens, it has to lose nine staff. Over the next five years, because of this so-called efficiency dividend, the family law court must lose 45 staff members. The workload is building up enormously. I cannot see the logic or sense of it. The chief justice also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a recurring problem, as the efficiency dividend really means that we have to shed the equivalent of nine staff each year at a time when our workload is steadily increasing . . . Our administrative expenses are close to budget so that the real problem is in staff numbers, but the dilemma is how to reduce staff numbers without a corresponding reduction in services. If we transfer monies from administration to salaries, as we have done in the past, we suffer a loss of 20% of the amount transferred.</PARA>
<PARA>So, if the court takes it out of administration to try to keep some people at the coalface, so to speak, working with dysfunctional families, it loses 20 per cent of it because that is part of the efficiency dividend. What craziness! The chief justice went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no real progress will be made in the long term while the Government adheres to its efficiency dividend policy, (now abandoned by the NSW Government). This currently erodes the Court's funding base and taken to its logical conclusion, will eventually mean that the Court will have to shut down registries or curtail services such as counselling and circuits to keep within budget.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not on. Everyone in this place is aware of the enormous growth of problems in families and divorce and the need for litigation, counselling and mediation. We are placing our Family Court in a situation where, sooner or later, if this keeps on going, it will disappear up its own exhaust pipe. That is not satisfactory. When we talk about curtailing services, we are talking about the impact on people. We are talking about people in crisis and people who are involved in frightful family dissolution. As I said, it has a very bad impact on men, women and children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the caseload for the Family Court in Coffs Harbour. There are presently 79 matters waiting for trial dates. At the next circuit, there are 114 fresh matters to be dealt with by the court. So, with a court circuit every six weeks, approximately 100 new matters are coming on line every six weeks. These are people in crisis and in great shock who need mediation, help and counselling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to what the chief justice said when he opened the sixth national family law conference. When talking about a pilot program for mediation, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pilot program has been very successful, but it would be naive to suggest that it can ever be a substitute for the Court's Counselling Service or the service offered by the Court's Registrars.</PARA>
<PARA>The court's counselling service and the court's registrars lose nine people every year because of the efficiency dividend. Eventually, carried to the logical, but not very sensible, conclusion, it will disappear. The chief justice went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does however, constitute another very useful additional technique in the settlement of family disputes and I am hopeful that it can soon be offered at all of the Court's Registries. The service has operated in the Melbourne Registry since January 1992 and in the Sydney Registry since November 1993. The court expects to open a service in Brisbane in 1995-6.</PARA>
<PARA>In May 1994, the court opened a new counselling service to the Gold Coast in Queensland, which is one of the fastest growing population areas in Australia, as is the north coast of New South Wales. The north coast of New South Wales has unemployment levels which are virtually double those in the rest of Australia. That places a significant strain on the system because areas with high unemployment are high stress areas. This is where you find a dreadful increase in domestic violence, marital breakdown and all of these things. The chief justice went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many other areas of Australia where permanent counsellors should be stationed such as Alice Springs, Coffs Harbour, the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, Gosford, Geelong and many others.</PARA>
<PARA>The Family Court can see it; the chief justice can see it. I am sure the Attorney-General can see it too. I am sure the Attorney-General and his parliamentary secretary are aware of the problem. I am absolutely certain that they will do everything in their power to try to address that problem and expand on it. But it comes back to money. Therefore, it comes back to the cabinet and the government as a whole, which will have to support what the Attorney-General and his parliamentary secretary are trying to do with more funding. This is not in the interests of the Family Court itself; this is in the interests of Australians who are in enormous trouble. The chief justice continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am also anxious to develop outreach counselling whereby the Court's counsellors will co-operate with other agencies, particularly in the outer suburbs of the large cities and will be posted to such locations, either on a permanent or visiting basis.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other initiatives which I believe should be pursued in the area of alternative dispute resolution and which I have conveyed to Government are the amendment of the Act to enable Registrars to conciliate property disputes prior to the filing of proceedings in the Court and the setting up of a small claims jurisdiction within the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly commend to the government the recommendations of the chief justice. The honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd), who spoke a little earlier on the bill and the coalition's attitude to it, was rather scathing of the coalition's proposition that the question of court supervision, consent orders and registered parenting plans, together with other more technical concerns, should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. He said, `There's no need to send the legislation to the Senate committee. Why on earth would the coalition want to delay this?' I say to the member for Leichhardt and others who share his views that we do not want to delay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report came before the parliament in 1992. The first version of the bill came here in June, which was a good year and a half later. Because it was not a very satisfactory bill&mdash;I will be polite about it&mdash;the government, of its own volition, withdrew it. Here it is back again in a much better form. We want the legislation to go to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs so that we get it right. Again, if it does mean a delay of another couple of months, that is okay; just let us please get it right. Let us get it right for the families and for the kids of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by noting the very desperate and urgent need for Family Court counsellors in Coffs Harbour to service the north coast of New South Wales and the northern tablelands. At present, the government and the parliamentary secretary have said, `It's up to the Family Court to allocate its funds accordingly. We're not telling the chief justice where he's got to put his counsellors; that's his decision.' But he cannot make any decision and he cannot put anybody in another area unless he has the funding to do it. Do not forget the disappearing up the exhaust pipe act where the efficiency dividends, for heaven's sake, are taking nine staff members away each year. I fail to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make sure that enough funding is given to the Family Court. I also make a plea for additional funding for the Family Life Movement. I briefly revert to what I said about the Coffs Harbour operation. The counsellors are supposed to look after Hastings, Maclean, Nambucca, Bellingen, Coffs Harbour, Clarence and the whole of the northern tablelands. They cannot get out of Coffs Harbour, except for looking after a few people in Grafton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the member for Charlton will stand up in a minute and say, `I don't know about the member for Cowper; he is always asking for more money.' I am always asking for more money for the Pacific Highway, as he knows. This time I make no apology whatsoever for asking for more money so that the Family Court can function efficiently and so that the Family Life Movement can function to its capacity and help the families, and in particular the children, of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2] 1994. I note that it is not a debate in the normal sense where we expect contention between the government and the opposition. The opposition has quite correctly indicated that it is supporting at least the general thrust of the bill and, as the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) has just indicated, it will be moving an amendment in the Senate at least in order to have a closer look at the question of whether or not the Family Court can or should exercise continuing surveillance over consent orders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties in connection with family law  generally is the fact that, with whatever goodwill and whatever good intentions governments bring to this question, there is no way that any government or any parliament can enact legislation which is designed to overcome, and be effective in doing so, basic human frailties, sensitivities and inadequacies. We can establish procedures, we can establish frameworks, we can establish processes and we can give leads, but we can never overcome, and we can never adequately compensate for, all of the difficulties that arise in human relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution made by the honourable member for Cowper was very valuable to the debate, as was the contribution made by the member who led for the opposition, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams). It was a very thoughtful and careful presentation of the opposition's attitude towards this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill seeks to amend the Family Law Act 1975. Consideration was given to the matter before the legislation was enacted in 1975, so it covers a period of about 20 years. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) drew attention in his second reading speech to what he regards as one of the great social initiatives of the Whitlam government. Yes, it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Credit is due to the late Lionel Murphy. To a very large extent Lionel Murphy was the architect of and had responsibility for the carriage of that legislation. He had the responsibility, as most members will recall, of attempting to encourage general community acceptance of the legislation. There were a lot of people who wanted the fault element of family breakdowns, separations and divorces retained. They wanted the guilt element retained, despite the fact that marriages fall apart when they irretrievably break down for whatever reason. One of the great achievements was to remove the concept of guilt from family breakdowns, separations and divorce and, at the same time, to start on a 20-year program of concentrating our attention on the interests of children, which is where it should be concentrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is very comprehensive. It is comprehensive in terms of the consultative processes to which it gives attention. It is also comprehensive in terms of the consultation which has taken place for it to get to this stage. The draft bill was introduced, as other members have observed, on 30 June and it has received fairly wide consideration since then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is also comprehensive in terms of its content. There are two particular elements to which I will be making reference. The first major element concerns part VII of the act, which deals with children, and the second major element, as far as I am concerned and as far as my contribution is concerned, is how we can extend the range of dispute resolution mechanisms which are available. These points are extremely and fundamentally important. I will not be saying much about the consideration which has been given to domestic violence in this particular legislation. That is something which I might have an opportunity to pursue on other occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, there are two further steps to which reference has been made in developing this general approach and this general issue. There will be a further bill introduced this sitting that will deal with matrimonial property, prenuptial financial agreements and a number of other issues. Hopefully that will be introduced during this present session. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) will make a justice statement early next year. In the context of that, he will be addressing the level and priority of family law funding. This bill is really part of a package of approaches which the government has undertaken to more adequately address the types of issues which are involved and the matters which are of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General. There is one particular statement that he made in that context to which I want to refer:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Law Act 1975 was one of the great social and legislative reforms of the Whitlam government . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have made reference to that, and I repeat it because it is of fundamental importance that we recognise the origin of it. Again, let me record credit to the late Lionel Murphy for his enlightened vision, his understanding and his humanity, which he brought to bear on that and other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will firstly deal with the general area of dispute resolution. The parliamentary secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once amended by this bill the act will emphasise the importance the government places on methods of dispute resolution other than litigation by categorising counselling and mediation as primary dispute resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>That is important. It provides an important conceptual  approach. In chapter 4 of the joint select committee report, the committee defined counselling and mediation. The committee accepted the definition of the Attorney-General's Department of `counselling':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a process where a neutral third party assists parties to deal with the stresses they encounter as they move into, live within or move out of the family unit.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to mediation, the committee accepted the Family Court and the Family Law Council definition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a process by which participants, with the assistance of a third person or persons, consider alternatives and reach a consensual settlement that will accommodate their needs.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation emphasises the participant's own responsibilities for making decisions that affect their lives.</PARA>
<PARA>They are important definitions because they are fundamental to the whole of the government's approach to counselling and mediation in dispute resolution. This legislation provides for an approval process for community based counselling and mediation so that organisations and individuals can apply for and receive approval status and therefore be involved in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether there are any matters that have come to my attention in my electoral office and from my constituency with which there is a greater level of human feeling involved than family law matters. I never cease to be amazed at the venom, the hatred, the despair, the anguish, the disillusionment and the frustration which people bring into my office in relation to their former partners. I tell them quite bluntly that there is no way in the world that I, or anyone else with whom I am associated in government or anywhere else, can enact legislation which will compensate for those attitudes. How is it possible for a man to have sired a child and for a woman to have borne that child and then feel about each other the way they do and express sentiments of venom and hatred, often verging on violence&mdash;certainly oral violence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am stunned and appalled, and I despair at some of the things I hear and the way in which those things are said. This is reflected in the recent attacks that we have had on Family Court judges, on the families of Family Court judges, on the property of court judges and on the property of the courts themselves. For example, just a few days ago&mdash;and this was apparently related to a case in which a wife was seeking custody of the children&mdash;a newspaper report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A three-hour siege ended peacefully yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>fortunately; they do not always end that way&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in Melbourne after a man who rammed his car through the front of a city Family Court building surrendered to police marksmen. Police charged&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I will not mention his name&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with conduct endangering life and criminal damage. He was remanded in custody to appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court on December 2.</PARA>
<PARA>Cases are compounded one after another. We will do our best, but our best will not be good enough. It will not be good enough until we are able to prevail on the basic humanity, goodwill, sensitivity and conscience of people to more effectively examine their circumstances, examine their human relationships, think more deeply about the welfare of their children and, hopefully, attempt to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another area that I want to refer to briefly. As well as the matters of counselling and mediation there is the appalling question of costs. If I get a chance, I will refer to some of the things that Lionel Murphy said in 1973 and 1974 when he referred to the question of costs. He introduced the legislation in the hope of reducing costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to a couple of things from the select committee report. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A witness in Albury, in response to a comment that `as the law is at the present, the solicitors, barristers and QCs are the ones making big, big money and leaving the two families poor for the rest of their lives', stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case the legal costs are well over $400,000 for all the parties and that is a lot of dough.</PARA>
<PARA>My word, it is a lot of dough! Submission 287 said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wanted legal advice, as I was working, my partner works casual&mdash;total income did not exceed $400 per week&mdash;I wasn't entitled to legal aid. On visiting four solicitors the following became evident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sol. 1 wanted $800 up front before he would look at the case. If he accepted the case I would have to pay an extra $2,000 plus barrister fees for the court + other costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sol. 2 $1,500 up front + $3,000 per day in court costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sol. 3 $1,250 up front + $1,500 per day plus barrister costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sol. 4 $300 to look at case $700 if case taken $80 per hour at court $72 per page of declarations etc. plus min of $500 for court costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, submission 354 said, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is costing the Government millions in Legal Aid, and the money parents are spending would be so much more beneficial going towards the children's upbringing.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it would be. If there is any means by which we can provide structures and arrangements to ensure that families are not going to burden themselves with debt and destroy themselves financially for the rest of their lives, then we should be giving consideration to them and, of course, that is precisely what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a Family Court in Newcastle. It was not established until 1980. I must give credit to all of my colleagues who campaigned for its establishment. Then there was the support that we have had from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), who has recently joined us. We keep an eye on the operation of the court and we are generally pleased with the operation of that court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court has 34 staff, including a director of court counselling, seven counsellors, one child-care worker and two administrative staff within the court counselling service. It has two judges. The registry has an estimated population catchment of 1.1 million, and the figures indicate that the registry is a productive and an efficient operation. Locally approved marriage counselling organisations include Unifam, Centacare, Marriage Guidance, Family Life and the Community Justice Centre. All around Australia, of course, we have similar types of operations related to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventy to 75 per cent of people reach satisfactory agreements through alternative dispute resolution; that is, they do not have to have the orders imposed on them in the process of litigation within the court and with all of the legal representation. Approximately five per cent of cases proceed to trial. It is in a sense a sorry reflection on our social circumstances that, according to some figures, 30 per cent of marriages fail and, according to other figures, 40 per cent. If we split the difference, about 35 per cent of all marriages in Australia fail. Very often, of course, they fail at a time when there are still dependent children within the marriage. Those children and their interests have to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major area of the amendments concerns the attitude towards and the treatment of children. The emphasis has been shifted, fortunately, from parental rights to parental responsibilities. There is an understanding that, when a family into which children have been born breaks up because of the alienation of the parents, the best interests of the children are of paramount importance. That issue is fundamental. To emphasise this, the concepts which tend to treat children as property have been avoided. References to custody and access have been taken out of the legislation. You do not have custody of children as a lump of property; you have a responsibility in relation to children. The mechanisms of custody and access orders have been replaced by residence orders and contact orders. I know you do not necessarily change meanings by changing titles, but there are important modifications built into that. In addition to those orders, there is also provision for child maintenance orders and what are referred to as special purpose orders. I know that that question was addressed by the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) to good effect in his response on behalf of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The orders can be determined by the court or, in the case of consent orders, endorsed by the court. I acknowledge the problem that the opposition has drawn attention to and that is inherent in this process. It is possible for consent orders to be registered and enforceable by the court and to be expressed with provisions, requirements and arrangements which the court itself would not impose. So there is a problem there. Of course we want people to come to understandings and agreements, and we want them to come to consent arrangements; but there is a problem there, and it is something that we will need to keep under review. The question of general court surveillance and related matters has been raised by a number of members. The unfortunate thing is that children are so often used as weapons in the parents' armoury, as part of their conflict equipment. The parents use their own children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of parental rights is a very contentious one, I recognise, and it is one which is often misunderstood. Parents often say, `Well, what about parents' rights?' But I want to emphasise the important common law principle identified in a United Kingdom case. Reference is made to this in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General. It was adopted by a majority of the High Court of Australia in what is identified as Marion's case:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of law is that parental rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the protection of the person and property of the child.</PARA>
<PARA>That principle is fundamental to the whole approach of this legislation. It recognises the fact that, as I said, children are not property and no-one, not even their parents, has any property rights over them. As far as possible, we must seek to free children from trauma associated with the breakdown in their parents' relationship. The essential purpose of these parts of the bill is to assist parents to reach agreement about arrangements for their children rather than having solutions imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 4 of part VII of the bill makes provision for parenting plans and encourages their use. Those plans can be registered and enforced. There is also an important variation from the present law under which the custodial parent exercises daily care and control of the child. Underlying this legislation is the principle that parents have a dual responsibility, a common responsibility, for their children. Certain provisions to that effect are built into the legislation. It is important legislation. It comes at the end of a 20-year period of development. It is not the end of the story, but we will, as we must, keep it under continuing surveillance and review and, perhaps, subject it to necessary and continuing reform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it had followed the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2] could have been one of the most important pieces of legislation brought before this parliament in the past 20 years. Regrettably, the government's response to those recommendations is inadequate. One can only hope that there will be further legislation from, and further change in attitude by, the government to what happens in what the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) has quite properly described as a very traumatic situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such situations are probably the most difficult ones for members of parliament to deal with. No doubt, every member of this House has talked to both the husband and wife in these sorts of cases and has experienced the trauma, the anger, the violence and the irrational behaviour which arise as a result of this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report by the joint select committee ran to 450 pages. The committee received 943 submissions. It held public hearings over two years throughout Australia, in capital cities and in many country areas. It took evidence and received submissions from a number of constituents from my electorate and, no doubt, from those in the electorate of Charlton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic philosophy for family law was spelt out in the Senate on 13 December 1973 by the then Attorney-General, Senator Lionel Murphy. In the second reading speech on the Family Law Bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hoped that in appropriate cases a person who has filed an application for divorce, particularly a person who has filed such an application before the end of the 12 months separation period, will use the services of expert marriage counsellors, who I expect to be attached at least to the Superior Court. I considered whether there should be provision for compulsory reconciliation conferences between the spouses, as there are in other countries, but rejected the notion as being unacceptable to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>I doubt that the late Lionel Murphy would have the same view if he were here with us today. A large number of people gave evidence to the joint select committee on the Family Law Act which bears testimony to the fact that the system is deficient. It is deficient because the philosophy adopted by the government is to attend to the damage after the event rather than to look at reconciliation and counselling processes before the matter reaches the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that that is easy to say in this House, but the Australian community could well look at whether there needs to be provision for compulsory reconciliation conferences before the event and whether it can devise a system to meet the requirements of the people before the processes move to the Family Court itself. The honourable member for Charlton has already referred to the anxiety, the trauma, the violence and the irrational behaviour that have occurred in this context. He gave just one example of a spouse who was obviously going through tremendous trauma in not being able to have access to his children and who then behaved so irrationally as to drive a car through the glass doors of the Family Court in Bourke Street in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many cases of similar pressures and tensions suffered by people who become involved in the court and the processes of property settlement and the rights of the children. I guess the No. 1 consideration in all of this is the absolute rights and best interests of the children of any broken marriage. That is where we need to direct our attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read through the three speeches that the late Senator Lionel Murphy made on the Family Law Bill when he introduced it and see that he rejected the idea of compulsory reconciliation conferences between the spouses, it occurs to me that somewhere along the line the government has missed the point that it is better to try to bring the parties together for a reconciliation process. Even if only some of the marriages could be saved, it would be in the best interests of the children, in the best interests of the two spouses and in the best interests of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that 1973 speech by Lionel Murphy he went on to say that the bill recognised the desirability of reconciliation being kept in mind at all stages until the marriage is dissolved. When he said he expected that the marriage counsellors would be attached at least to the superior court, even then that was looking at the aftermath, after the spouses  have got to the courts; it was not looking forward and looking at providing reconciliation counselling before the processes moved into the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having read that and seen the basic philosophy and thread, I noticed that it was reflected even in the terms of reference of the committee of inquiry. The first term of reference was the role, funding, effectiveness and availability of the services of the Family Court Counselling Service. I did not see any mention of this in the report until the conclusions on counselling services on page 52. Paragraph 3.82 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would prefer to see increased funding for marriage education, and the introduction of measures to increase community awareness of the benefits of seeking professional help at an early stage in marital difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. That has not been adopted by the government, because all the talk in this bill and in the government's rhetoric is that the funding and the counselling will be available after the processes at the Family Court. Yet we see in this report that the committee made a particular point in that recommendation and the conclusions that the effort needs to be made before that stage, and that we must provide increased funding for marriage education and the introduction of measures to increase community awareness of the benefits of seeking professional help at an early stage in any marital difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any member in this House could argue with that, but it is contrary to the philosophy spelt out by the late Senator Lionel Murphy in his second reading speech when he introduced his bill. That part of it is very important. The Chief Justice of the Family Court in fact gave evidence to the committee and, in that evidence&mdash;referred to on page 306, at paragraph 13.24 of the report&mdash;he referred to the level of satisfaction of litigants after the settlement of a dispute. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been a practising barrister for many years before I was a judge and I do not think I recall anyone who was ever satisfied with a settlement of a dispute, other than those who managed to get a result that was wildly beyond what they expected. But that did not happen very often.</PARA>
<PARA>His next words are very telling:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think in family law matters there is never a winner.</PARA>
<PARA>By making that statement, the Chief Justice of the Family Court has really reinforced something that members of parliament dealing with these problems see day after day. There are no winners; in fact, there are many losers. That is why I am stressing the need for the government to see what can be done in the area of reconciliation processes of counselling and marriage guidance. Have another look at this report. See if it is necessary to bring back legislation. If it does not require legislation, then the government should at least adopt a change of thinking that will direct attention to those areas where the funding could be applied, to foster an awareness in the community that people should seek help before things reach the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of children has been an issue that has arisen recently. I have had discussions with members of Victoria Police on this matter. It was addressed on page xix at paragraph 42 of the committee's report. I want to refer to that because it is a particularly important issue. Victoria Police told me that they have not been advised about orders that were made by the courts for the transfer of children to one or other of the spouses outside a police station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee obviously looked at this, because it made recommendations to the government that, unless certain criteria had been met, the changeover should not occur outside a police station. It said that the changeover of the children from one spouse to the other should not occur `unless it has been positively ascertained that the police station is suitably staffed to facilitate such a change-over', unless `the officer in charge of that police station agrees to the police station being used as a custody exchange point' and unless `a copy of the order has been made available to the officer in charge of the police station at least 48 hours prior to any custody/access change-over'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victoria Police advised me that they were quite often finding out after the event that it had been designated that a changeover should occur outside a police station. The partners would turn up and events would lead to an emotional outburst which, quite often, would end up in physical violence. The police would first know about it when they had to come out and try to mediate in the dispute. One can imagine the trauma that the spouses and the children go through in a process like that. That is a very important issue which should be addressed by the government. I have looked through the bill and I do not see any reference to it. It may be tucked away in the fine print somewhere, but I certainly do not see anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to another matter, which is the report of the ombudsman. On page 362 of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, the ombudsman made some very telling comments about the Child Support Agency. I know that, whilst it may not be exactly expressed in this bill, it certainly is related to it. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSA may well have been the greatest single source of difficulty for my office during the year. It was not just the complaint numbers. Its administrative system seems complex, its staff appear at times not to have grasped how the law operates; and it is not as responsive to complaints, whether from me or from the public, as ought to be expected . . . But the number of complaints remains a prime source of concern because the client group is so much smaller than that of the other agencies with high complaint levels.</PARA>
<PARA>I also note that 204,000 people had been involved in complaints to the Child Support Agency, as at September 1991. I know that that figure is still increasing. You have to ask yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether the government has, in fact, got it right with the legislation that is before the House. I do not believe that it has. I think its response to the committee's report has been inadequate, and the government needs to have another look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I also believe that the government's response to the Child Support Agency issues is inadequate. One has to ask oneself whether it is the Child Support Agency administration, the process or the law that is deficient. It is likely to be a combination of all three. I believe that it is imperative that the government revisit the Family Law Act and the committee of inquiry's recommendations on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other issues which the government needs to address. I have endeavoured to spell some of them out this morning in my address to the House, but I believe that there are many things which go back to the fundamental process, right from its beginning on 13 December 1973. The government needs to return to that and to discuss the philosophy behind that. It needs to look at the history of the family law legislation in the past 20 years to find out whether the original philosophy, as expressed by then Attorney-General Lionel Murphy, was adequate and whether it meets the requirements of the people who become involved in divorce proceedings. It also needs to look at the fundamental issue of whether the rights and interests of the children involved are properly addressed. I do not believe they are. I think that it is appropriate for the government to go back and to look at that. Otherwise, we are going to see a continuation of the trauma, the violence and the irrational behaviour that feature in so many of these cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise to support the Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2] and I acknowledge the thoughtful contribution by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). The private experiences and personal pain of people are indeed a very difficult area for government to legislate on. Family life, as we have all experienced, is very varied. Nothing works quite so well as family life when it is working well and, at the same time, nothing is more difficult and more traumatic than family life when it fails to meet nurturing and caring needs, as happens when families break down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduced by Lionel Murphy in 1973 was a watershed in our history that moved us away from the bad old days of having to find cause and marital misconduct. An unintended consequence of that revolution and reform was that we failed to understand the human difficulties and the need of people to find someone to blame when they suffer hurt and dislocation in their personal lives. It would seem to me, from my professional experience in counselling families, that this need to blame, and to project that blame onto another person, has found its way into custody disputes in the Family Court process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of blame was obviously one of many looked at by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. I commend the work of that committee. Some of its members are on the joint standing committee that is currently looking at the child support scheme. I pay tribute to that very hardworking committee. I also pay tribute to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), who has been very prompt in his response, and to the reform agenda that this government has to make the law more accessible and to provide for real social justice for Australians. The reforms currently being debated will go a considerable way to meeting the many difficulties in this area of law, difficulties that are well known, I believe, to every local member because we get many calls and requests for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two main areas in the amendments to the Family Law Reform Bill. The first is the extension of the availability of dispute resolution procedures involving mediation and counselling. The bill makes it clear that it is talking about primary dispute resolution, giving a signal to potential litigants that these forms of dispute resolution should be engaged in prior to seeking resolution of any dispute through a court imposed decision. But this does not take away the right of applicants to proceed to law. As other speakers have indicated, two of the major problems for people in seeking to have their concerns addressed are the huge costs and time delays involved in presenting a case to the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second main focus is in part VII of the act. It has been redrafted entirely and replaces the current concepts of custody, access and guardianship with a new statutory concept called `parental responsibility'. In addition to the notion of parental responsibility, parents have a duty to provide the child with a residence and contact in accordance with agreed parenting plans or court orders. I will refer later in more detail to that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the move to expanding the counselling and mediation opportunities is very pertinent and to the point. It has been my experience that, when marriages break down, the breakdown has often been of a long gestation. Very often, the seeds of the failure of the relationship have their origin in the histories of those two individuals and, particularly, their experiences in their own families of origin. So, when one comes to provide counselling for people at this very traumatic time, one is often faced with traumas that go back to their own families, their relationships with their parents and the sorts of gender roles that were defined in their families. I have very often had the experience of realising that those difficulties had their origins in the grandparents' experiences. So, as far as one can trace back with an individual or a couple, one is often dealing with several generations of difficulty and dysfunction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is also dealing with the fact that we often base our concept of family life on the interesting concept of romantic love. We translate this into the most important social and economic unit in our society, wherein we choose to nurture and raise the next generation. In fact, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl&mdash;as I am sure you would recognise&mdash;romantic love, lust or a combination of both is not what keeps relationships together over a long period of time. What I have discovered personally, and in my counselling, is that the qualities you need for the long haul are respect, caring, consideration, friendship, tolerance and forbearance&mdash;all those things that members of this House display on a day-to-day basis as we debate issues across the floor. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZU5">Ms HENZELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague. When people make choices in the glow of love, lust or a combination of both, we should not be surprised that, in the afterglow, they find that they have not spent time developing those other qualities which would develop a long-term relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often put to me that if we had lots more counsellors and so on we would not have all these marriage breakdowns. Certainly, counselling can make a huge difference, but we cannot change the course of history. We are in a period of rapid economic and social change, with new expectations and new opportunities for both men and women to develop and pursue independence in their work and family responsibilities. I believe the fact of marriage breakdown is going to stay with us. I think it would be unrealistic to suggest that if we provide lots and lots of counselling we are going to stop that from happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what we can do right through the process&mdash;and I think this is important for the family agencies and Family Court counsellors, at that end of the spectrum&mdash;is provide a range of marriage education and support counselling opportunities. It is in the nature of human beings that they do not think they have got a problem until it hits them between the eyes. Very often, it is not until one or other party walks out of a relationship that the partner who is left finally faces the fact that there have been problems. At that point in time, it is absolutely crucial that people have access to mediation and counselling services, of which this bill is going to allow a much wider distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is particularly the case in regional and rural areas of the country. It is certainly true in my own electorate. The experience I had in mining towns was that the availability of Family Court counsellors was limited to two counsellors in Rockhampton, which meant that people had to take time off work and travel for two or three hours, or more, for an appointment. They often had to miss work and so on to avail themselves of those opportunities. In fact, it was through my own program of providing family counselling on site, in a program that was supported by unions and management, that the coalmining communities that I worked in had, for the first time, a professional counselling service available&mdash;at a crisis level and in the longer term&mdash;to work on these issues. Under this new legislation, the sorts of services that I was providing would be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that can be dealt with in counselling at this point is assisting both parties to obtain information about their rights under the act but also encouraging them to begin to solve the problem rather than taking it through the legal system. As the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) and others have said, not only does the court system impose huge costs and stresses and mark the beginning of a long descent into acrimony and threat and counterthreat which ultimately affects the children in a very destructive way; it also militates against the possibility that the parents will begin to see that the important issue, as they deal with their own pain at the break-up of the relationship and the loss of many dreams they had about what their future would provide for them, is that they must be aware of what this experience is doing to their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all members of the House, whether they are parents or otherwise, are aware of the destructive consequences to children of lack of resolution of marital disputes which then spill over into parenting disputes. It is my view that the only way we will achieve a satisfactory solution is, as soon as possible, to provide the potential litigants with the opportunity to work through the trauma, the anger and the grief and begin to take responsibility not only for their part in the break-up of the relationship but for their need to see that they have a continuing responsibility to their children and that they must be able to set aside their conflicts with their ex-spouse or ex-partner to achieve an effective parenting role with their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where this is not possible, there is the difficulty of one party being discouraged from having access or of access orders not working under the old scheme. That is the great challenge of the new plan, which provides for both parenting plans and orders and which, as the bill makes clear, is founded on these principles: the children have the right to know and be cared for by both parents; children have the right of contact on a regular basis with both parents and any other person significant to the care, welfare and development of the child; parents share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of the child; and parents should agree about the future parenting of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These principles come out of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Australia ratified on 17 December 1990, and they are indeed very sound principles on which the new parenting plans and orders are premised. However, that is the challenge, because what we have to overcome, as I said, are the hostilities. It is altogether understandable that children faced with the fractioning of their family life wish fervently for a situation where they can reunite their parents, and they often have fantasies about their power to make this happen. One of the things in counselling children is to help them accept the fact that they do not have that sort of power; that it is a psychological process that they go through, believing that, if only they would be better or stronger, that could effect the reunification of the family. That often leads to huge difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of the reforms that I am particularly pleased about is the extension of counselling services and representation of children. While it has always been held that the Family Law Act was intended to maintain the welfare of the children, it is very easy for counsellors and others to assume that they know best, and the children are not in a position to make a judgment or a decision. Given that children can be caught between their commitments to both parents, it is my experience that if children are offered the opportunity to work through these conflicts they can express a view about their degree of contentment, but it is important to emphasise their need to somehow effect the resolution on their terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many parents who have felt a great deal of anger and frustration when the court or court counsellors, with the best intentions in the world, have made decisions, based on their assessment or interview with both parents, that have not been for the children's perceived welfare. In spite of decisions made by the court, situations then arise where children run away from home or suffer further difficulties in their relationships with the parent with whom they are residing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a great challenge in front of us to now effect these changes. Allocation of considerable resources into the counselling and mediation area will be needed so that particularly in regional and rural areas of the country&mdash;I see you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, nodding in agreement because we both represent regional areas of the country&mdash;people can have access to mediation and counselling assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems arise, for instance, with a teleconference. One party can be sitting in the office of the Family Court counsellor, say, in Brisbane while the other party may be in Rockhampton or further west, which is an unequal situation. The alternative is a great deal of expense for the parent who is wanting to attend the conference in person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a great deal to do in this area. However, I believe that the reforms in the bill will clearly signal major changes, particularly to the notion of children being `property' of parents and the need to make sure that the views and concerns of all parties&mdash;the children and the two spouses&mdash;are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be my contention that the sooner we allow for the possibility of access to counselling and advice at the time of the separation of the parties the sooner parents will be encouraged not only to deal with their own trauma in the failure of a relationship but to focus on their responsibilities to their children, who never wanted the break-up to happen in the first place in most instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill's very important reforms will make a major contribution and will go some way towards making sure that there is real access to justice and that the cost of that justice allows people to feel that they have been able to pursue their requirements. At the other end, we need to strive to make sure that right through the development of families there is access to education information that will assist them to solve problems before the point of marriage breakdown. So I commend the bill to the House and I commend the Attorney-General and the reform agenda that he has in place with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) on major areas that impact daily on the lives of families in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My views on the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2] are based, as they are for us all, on a mixture of inputs into my life. As a member of parliament, like so many other members, I am well aware that the present system of family law in this country is unsatisfactory. That has been made clear to me by the number of people who have come through my office door with problems. In particular, the Child Support Agency is probably the most incompetent organisation ever invented by any bureaucracy anywhere in the world. I do not think I would get much argument from any member in this place on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are broader issues in this bill than just the Child Support Agency. Before becoming a member of parliament, I was involved at one time with counselling services in this area. Within the last two years I have also had personal experience, through my own divorce, of the Family Court, custody and access matters, and the use of the counselling service, so I also speak as a user of the system. It is very hard to divorce my emotional experiences in that regard and be totally objective on some of these matters, but it does give me a unique perspective. Going through the Family Court is a very painful and difficult process. It could be made a lot easier with better basic administration, apart from any changes to structures. I will say more about that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) said in his opening speech that the coalition will not oppose the legislation, but we will refer some questions of concern to a committee. Overall, I am uncomfortable with many elements of this bill. Fundamentally, it is about dispute resolution and counselling. The legislation is based on evidence from the United Kingdom which I do not believe is actually substantiated. I will return to that point later as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with this bill is that it seeks to defy human nature. It is a matter of hope triumphing over reality. Essentially, the mechanisms that are being put in place, with counselling and arbitration before resorting to the legal system, substantially favour those who have the money to hold out for a long time. They favour those who have a strong personality or are smooth talkers and who can prolong the process on an ongoing basis until they get their own way. The right outcome does not necessarily evolve from that process. If people cannot agree within a marriage, they have even less chance of agreeing under stress when they are getting divorced or are separated, particularly if they are trying to build new lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following points are not in any priority order, but they are the concerns that I have about this bill. Firstly, if counselling or arbitration is to be effective, the quality of the people providing that service has to be looked at. From my experience, that is a major concern. This legislation sets up a mechanism whereby counselling services can effectively be contracted out. Other speakers in this debate have said it is desirable that it be contracted out so that the court is not involved. Counselling or arbitration has to be seen to be independent, particularly if later on the matter becomes a case before the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I worry that many of the organisations likely to be approved will be voluntary organisations, made up of those desirous of being involved, who will not necessarily be trained or experienced. I note that in the reporting and accounting mechanisms there is provision for the minister to exempt organisations from any accountability in terms of how the money is spent and in terms of the work that they undertake. That is a real concern. We are going to see a number of amateurs involved who could do more damage than good. For example, I am aware of a minister of religion who at the moment does not provide maintenance for his own children&mdash;he is the non-custodial parent&mdash;but who offers counselling services. I will be very interested to see whether that particular gentleman is approved. Obviously, I hope he will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with what is proposed in this legislation is the time factor for going through the process. If there are not enough people and resources, as has been mentioned by a number of speakers, by the time a couple gets an appointment, has a counselling session and perhaps a follow-up session&mdash;and quite often the counsellors, as the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) so rightly said, think they know best and want the people to come back&mdash;it can be quite a lengthy process. The couple may then have to go through the arbitration process, and eventually to court if they cannot agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a time of major upset, trial and turbulence in the life of the children of the marriage, that ongoing, drawn-out process is most destabilising for them. Children need stability; they need to know where they stand. It is highly desirable that these matters be dealt with expeditiously. What this legislation is proposing will, in fact, make the present situation even worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the change of terms to residence orders and contact orders, instead of having custody and access orders, and there are variations of course, that is stated to be a change because people want to get away from the idea of ownership of human beings. I understand the sentiment but it seems to me that whatever terms we use, no matter what label we pin on something, ultimately we are going to have the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to achieve a particular outcome, whatever label they apply to the name of the process, if they do not get what they want in the end, then they are going to be just as disaffected. We are going to have the same bitterness and problems, potential violence and so on. I do not see name changes as particularly relevant and I think that that is a bit of window-dressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary dispute resolution proposal obviously is not appropriate in all cases. But as I read the legislation&mdash;and I would love to be corrected&mdash;all cases are going to be forced through that process. It seems to me that at a time of difficulty and stress for the parties, and for the children in particular, we are going to add extra layers of suffering and difficulties to those parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, where there is an imbalance of power between the separating or divorcing parties, or a change of status or whatever, an arbitration or conciliation system is unworkable. The trouble is that that imbalance of power is often only known to the parties at the beginning of the process. It is the person who is at the lower end of that imbalance of power who is going to suffer the worst, and that is not going to be apparent. Therefore, to force everybody through that process is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, much has been made about the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the fact that signing that convention means we have to reflect many of the standards in that convention in this legislation. In principle I do not have any problem with that but I do have a problem with some of the current thinking that seems to be gaining credence in our society where children have rights at an increasingly early age. I do not believe&mdash;and remember they are children&mdash;that they always have the maturity to handle some of those alleged rights at that young age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Particularly in this field, we often see the situation where one child plays off one parent against the other, or where children will make decisions on limited knowledge and information thinking that they might, as the previous speaker indicated, get their parents back together or something of that sort. It seems to me that children are ill-equipped to make decisions in this area. I am concerned that it seems to have become a convention in the Family Court that 12-year-olds can express a view as to where they wish to live. It seems to me that 12-year-olds are not mature enough, emotionally or in many other ways, to make those sorts of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And then we come to the question of the parenting plan, a written document between the parents. I wish to ask the question, and I would like to be enlightened by the minister in the fullness of time, about enforcement. It seems to me that a general document can be written but I do not understand how to make sure it is implemented with good intention on a day-to-day basis. There are all sorts of ways of getting around those arrangements and if the document is to be enforceable then it seems to me that it clearly has to be something that is enforced by the courts because there is no other mechanism that I am aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a concern about the provision for constant revision of this parenting plan. Section 62D of the Family Law Act says that a request for counselling can be made at any time about a matter relating to a child. If that really means that&mdash;that it can be made at any time before, during or after the process and throughout the child's life&mdash;then it seems to me that that is going to make life unworkable and disruptive for the parent who has responsibility for looking after the child, and for the child itself. Frankly, one could spend one's life going back to counselling and arbitration and so on. There has to come a time when a decision is taken in the interests of all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I read the legislation, there is to be no testing of the accuracy or truthfulness of what is said in counselling and arbitration, because of the secrecy provisions, of course. Although a subsequent report may go to a court, it cannot subsequently be challenged, because what is said cannot be disclosed. It is interesting to note that Judge Joske from the Family Court was not, as I understand it, supportive in his evidence of some of the changes being proposed&mdash;particularly with the access and custody matter I referred to earlier. He used the word `window-dressing' and said that it would have no impact. My experience is that Judge Joske is one of the better judges and shows a great deal of commonsense in the courts. He certainly has a good record. I am concerned that there are perhaps others around who are more concerned with social engineering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that there is no certainty about what is likely to happen in this field. If someone goes to a solicitor, he will actually tell you quite openly, `I cannot give you any guidance. I cannot tell you what the norms are; it will depend on which judge we draw on the day, and on how that judge feels when he gets out bed in the morning.' That is the state of family law in this country. Therefore there are matters of standards which the Chief Justice of the Family Court ought to be paying attention to, rather than necessarily restructuring the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have flagged some problems over resources. My belief is that if we are to implement legislation of this nature&mdash;with extensive counselling, arbitration and all the other resources&mdash;it will in fact require considerable resources and training of the people involved. Of course, we need to make those services readily available. It may cut down on some of the legal costs, and there is no doubt that the legal costs involved at the moment are quite shameful. In that sense, it may well advantage people; but the government has to recognise that there will be a cost to the taxpayer. We have also flagged concerns over court registration of parenting plans, and we want that referred to a committee, as was mentioned earlier by my colleague the honourable member for Tangney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would also like to make a couple of other points. Section 64B(7) provides a definition of `made in favour'; in other words, a residence order is made in favour of a person with whom the child is supposed to live. So, whether one is talking about custody and access and all those other words which we are told are now not acceptable because of their hidden connotations, it seems to me that if one makes an order `in favour' it is exactly the same process. The interpretation is that one either wins or loses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of maintenance, the legislation&mdash;as far as I can see&mdash;does not address the situation where a parent arranges his or her finances so as to avoid maintenance. As many of us in this place will know, with child support cases, this often applies to self-employed people, where they cannot be got at when they fail in their responsibilities to make appropriate payments. But it also applies where people arrange their income to get a lot of it paid in kind&mdash;because, of course, it is net salaries that tend to be taken into account. We see avoidance of responsibilities quite often but, under this system, there is still an entitlement to exercise parental rights via the parenting plan. There should be no rights to parenting plan input and so on without some acceptance of financial responsibility. There ought to be a linkage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In division 10 of the legislation, the term `child's best interests' is spelt out. I reiterate the point I made earlier that the wishes expressed by the child are a major concern. If one looks at the forces acting on individual children, at the age of 12 of 13 they naturally want to see their parents back together, even if that is totally unrealistic. They are swayed by the loneliness of one parent or the apparent upset of one parent as compared with the other, and they are not in a position, it seems to me, to make what is going to be a judgment in their interests. The judgment ought to be in their interests, yet many children will express a view based on what they believe are the interests of their parents. The report to the court by the family and child counsellor could well be skewed in favour of the dominant parent, because the articulate and powerful tend to know the phrases to use and will get their way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of separate representation for the child, I think there are a number of failures in the present system. I am aware of a case, for example, where a separate representative was appointed, took weeks and weeks to see the appropriate child, had a 10-minute chat and then came along and delivered a `considered' judgment. That sort of superficial activity which goes on at the present time just does not help the situation and I think has to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule 2, clause 3, talks about interim arrangements. As I read the legislation, it says that cases now lodged but not heard are to be dealt with `as if this Act is in force', even though the act has not been commenced, and that seems to me to be entirely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer very briefly to the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant departure in this bill from the approach recommended by the joint select committee is in the relationship between children and their parents. The committee recommended that the existing terminology of guardianship, custody and access should be retained. That terminology suffers from connotations of proprietorial rights in children, delivering them as the spoils of victory to the parent gaining custody. The government was not convinced of the select committee's view that a change in terminology and approach was unnecessary and sought from the Family Law Council a report on the operation of the Children Act 1989 in the UK. This act has moved away from the existing approach in Australia. I thank the council for its prompt and incisive report which was tabled in this House on 3 May.</PARA>
<PARA>But if one actually reads the report&mdash;and time will in fact preclude me from going through too many extracts&mdash;what it says very clearly is that there is no firm evidence that what has been done has actually improved the situation. People think it is better, there are some warmer feelings there, but there is actually no evidence at all. Yet, based on that, we are proposing to make changes that will affect people's lives for many years to come. That is something that I am not particularly comfortable about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the solution for the Chief Justice of the Family Court ought to be not more legislation but administering the present process a lot better, to get cases into court on time. I know a case where in June the judge said that he wanted the arrangements with children sorted out by Christmas ready for the new school year, and yet the court is not even going to have the pre-trial hearing until just before Christmas. The actual hearing will not be until March, in other words, part way through the year, which means the child will almost certainly stay where it is at the moment. That sort of rank administrative inefficiency seems to me to be a major problem, and I do not see that this legislation is going to change that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think one needs that certainty of advice, as I mentioned before. We need to deal with this use of structuring of income because people need certainty, they need reasonable speed and they need simplicity, and they are going to get the reverse in this particular legislation. In fact, I think it will make the situation worse. I do not see where there are many user views represented in this. It seems to be an awful lot of legal views. Obviously there are men&mdash;it is predominantly, but not exclusively, men who tend to be the non-custodial parents&mdash;who suffer, and I do not see that this is going to fix their problem. This will create more suffering for women. Children have a rough time and it will make it worse for them. In the second reading speech, the parliamentary secretary  said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By implementing those recommendations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the joint select committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which the government accepts, the parliament should go a long way in providing a simpler, fairer and speedier family law justice system for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the present system needs improving but I am not so sure that this will do it. Based on that UK legislation, there is a real question mark: why ignore some of the key recommendations of the joint select committee? Why not deal with the legal concerns over registering of parenting plans? We have taken the view not to oppose, subject to some amendments, and I accept that. However, I believe that the bill is bureaucratic and costly and will cause unnecessary time delays. It will cause further uncertainty for children and place further unfair pressure on the child. The strong, not the right or the just, will prevail, and I think this will do a lot of damage to future generations of Australians. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So do I, although I know I am. The bill is important because it improves the lot of families and, in particular, children. Anybody reading the legislation and seeing what it will bring about cannot fail to appreciate that families, and in particular the children, will be better off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill eases access to the law, and that is well in line with the government's present access to justice policy. At this stage I would like to commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General, the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), for the excellent work that they have done in making the law much more accessible to average Australians. Of course, fundamental to that is keeping down the cost of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a further step in the 1975 Family Law Act, which was brought in by the then Attorney-General, Mr Lionel Murphy. That was a major change at the time, because the act took the emphasis away from the concept of guilty parties. Those of us who lived through those times saw people sometimes having to set up a situation where they could be proved guilty in order that both parties could get out of a marriage that was unsatisfactory. Taking the emphasis off the concept of guilt and guilty parties was very important. We are learning from that, and this is why we are bringing in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read from the second reading speech of the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, on the Family Law Bill in which he said it was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  the most important social reform. It will affect the lives of many people. By introducing a sane, balanced law to deal with family disputes, it is hoped that where marriages do break down&mdash;as they undoubtedly will continue to do so under the stresses and strains of modern life&mdash;persons will be encouraged to adjust their transition from married life with the minimum of bitterness and animosity. At least under this legislation, persons will not become financially as well as emotionally bankrupt as a result of divorce proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, that has not worked to the extent that Lionel Murphy would have liked, but it was, as I said, the first step and we are now moving on to the next step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also breaks new ground on the attitudes, rights and responsibilities of parents. I take issue with the member for Aston when he talked about children not being old enough to know what their rights are. The rights of children, as I see it, are well spelt out in the United Nations declaration: the right to food, the right to be clothed, the right to habitation, the right to education and all of those fundamental things. It is not a question of children standing up and saying, `I have got a right to this; I'm going to have it.' They have those fundamental basic rights as dependent people. It is time those roles changed, and this bill goes a long way towards that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Chifley (Mr Price) talked about our sometimes reacting at the wrong ends of things. This is something that I have long thought about. You reach a certain age, you go to so many weddings and you see so many divorces. I have long thought that our attitudes are wrong: we rejoice when people get married and think it is absolutely wonderful, even though a lot of the times we know that it is a totally unsuitable match. Once that marriage breaks up, it is suddenly everybody's business: the state moves in, particularly when there are children involved, and the law gets involved in the division of property and so on. As the member for Chifley said, we need to do more prior to that eventuality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriage counselling has long been established in this country, as it has in other countries, but generally it is only called into play when there is a problem. I think marriage counselling ought to be part of the preparation for marriage. I know that some people do go through that preparation&mdash;perhaps not always with people who are quite wise to human relationships. The member for Aston talked about a clergyman who counselled people when they were contemplating divorce, yet he was not maintaining his own children. Sometimes people in those sorts of roles take on the position of counsellor when they are perhaps not qualified for it. I would like to quote from George Bernard Shaw, a very wise playwright, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal and exhausting condition continuously until death do them part.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very moot point; people are in love when they marry and they very often do not think about their actual compatibility, which is something that goes much deeper than that initial passion of love. So counselling is needed before marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about divorce. I hear people from the pulpit, the podium and various places saying, `It is bad; it is absolutely shocking that we have so much divorce.' Obviously, we would all like people to live happily; we would all like children to live in happy families. But to absolutely condemn divorce because it happens is not a good thing. As a child, I felt very strongly at times that I would much rather have been in a single-parent family that was happy than in a two-parent family that was in a constant state of war. But that was not quite as easy in those days. The member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) said that people should stay in marriages&mdash;he mentioned that phrase which sent chills up my spine because it is one I heard so much as a child&mdash;`for the sake of the children'. A lot of other adults and perhaps children would say, as I have said, that staying together for the sake of the children often has a more harmful effect on children than does splitting up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not diminish in any way the feelings that children have when marriages break up. As many of the speakers on this bill have already said, children suffer guilt feelings. They feel they are responsible, they develop resentment to one parent or the other and at times they become the pawns of parents. I do not for one minute say that children from broken marriages suffer no trauma. But we also have to acknowledge that there is a lot of trauma when children are growing up in families which are bitterly unhappy and constantly at war. We need to perhaps take a bit more of a rational attitude. We should not at all rejoice when people get divorced, but we should realise that in some circumstances it is the best thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot legislate to make people love each other; we cannot legislate to make people happy; we cannot legislate to make them respect each other. What we can do is legislate for facilities that will enable people to sit down and calmly work through their problems. One of the main thrusts of this bill is a mediation, dispute resolution and counselling facility, where people can sit down and do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Aston said that everybody filing for divorce will have to make use of such facilities. That is totally wrong. It is not going to be compulsory at all. It is acknowledged that these kinds of facilities will not suit everybody, particularly in situations where there was a strong imbalance of power and where violence in the family has been prevalent. But for many other cases these facilities will be useful. In fact, they have already been useful. I would like to quote from the government's response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act. The government talks about a pilot program of mediation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the evaluation of the pilot program is not completed, results so far are very encouraging. Mediation resolved one of the major issues brought to the table by the partners in 80 per cent of cases and completely resolved all issues in more than 60 per cent of cases. More importantly, 90 per cent of participants using mediation have not started litigation despite the fact that most involved difficult child and property disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that speaks very well for the benefits of this kind of facility. I take on board what was said earlier by the member for Aston and a number of other speakers about the need for high quality, well-trained people conducting these mediation and dispute resolution and counselling sessions. It is difficult if you are trying to do it with someone who has a particular bias one way or the other. I have certainly had people come to my office who have felt that a person in mediation in the Family Court has been particularly biased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of benefits to mediation. It will take the litigation aspect out of many divorces. The parliamentary secretary gave me a copy of a speech he made last night to a group in Adelaide. One of the things he said in that speech was that, as soon as people decide they are going to get a divorce, somebody says to them, `Get a lawyer.' That is the first thing they are told. Mostly, they are given the name of a lawyer who has been recommended by someone else who has been through the same process. So what we want to get away from is those people having the immediate reaction: I must go to the law. I hope that this bill will encourage them to go to mediation facilities instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot has been said about the cost of the law and the cost of the Family Court. The Family Court budget is approximately $88.5 million&mdash;that is the court costs. Then we have the costs to the individuals who go into litigation. I think everybody who has spoken today has said&mdash;undoubtedly, the rest of the speakers will all say the same&mdash;that they as local members all have a great number of people coming to them about Family Court cases and, of course, child support, which is closely related. Sometimes I find myself acting as an unofficial counsellor without trying to give advice, because I am certainly not qualified to. But people want to come and talk to somebody. Just unburdening themselves of their problem, getting whatever it is off their chest&mdash;perhaps it is about a spouse, the Family Court or the Child Support Agency&mdash;is a great help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mediation will cut costs for people going to court. Of course, a lot of people do not only just go to court and get their judgment on the divorce, the property settlement and the child custody but also very often they have to go back to court because the other partner does not keep his or her side of the deal. Very often this happens with access, which is one of the difficult situations that I have come across. I have seen people in desperate states over access. I say to them, `Your only resolve is to go back to the court,' and they say, `I can't afford to go back to the court.' So, if there is a mechanism whereby those things can be sorted out without involving lawyers, I think it is to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be taken into account that mediation, counselling or whatever may save some marriages. I know that some people file for divorce and during the process do reach a conciliation situation. So, if these people are being dealt with by trained counsellors, maybe that can help as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lawyer who works in the Family Court has said to me, `Look, we do not want more mediation; everyone who wants to get into that situation does now, and it is only the people who actually hate each other's guts and don't want to speak to each other who go to court.' But I think there is room for more people to go into mediation, even though they may be reluctant to do so to start with and even though the process may be looked on as one of dispute resolution&mdash;as some parts of it will be. It should be said to those people, `Look, it is going to be cheaper than you going up there and getting a judge.' As the member for Aston said, different judges give different judgments, so it is the luck of the draw on occasions. It is extremely important that people know they are going to sit down with a qualified person who will make sure that they are not intimidated by the other person to sort out even those very basic things, like who gets the cat, without having to go to law and without it costing a lot of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thrust of the bill is about children and removes those words `custody' and `access'. Again, the member for Aston said that is a cosmetic change; we are just changing the words. We are changing a lot more than the words. Those words have a firm connotation. Custody does imply ownership&mdash;this person is mine. I think that goes back to the old patriarchal times when in fact the wife and the children were the possessions, the property, of the man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 60 per cent of divorce suits filed in Australia include children. I think you will agree that their welfare is absolutely paramount. This bill sets out to look at the welfare of the child. I have already talked about the effect that divorce has on children. Of course, it is a very traumatic time for them, as it is for their parents. It is a time when everybody is feeling very raw and vulnerable. We should try to get away from having them sitting in a place that is rather scary, a place they do not go to as a matter of course, to see a judge&mdash;particularly, with due respect to the clerks, wearing a wig and a gown&mdash;as someone in authority, someone who is totally detached from them, as I think that can be very frightening for children. To be able to take them out of that scenario is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, I have had a lot of people in my electorate come to me with their problems. Gaining access to the children is one of the hardest problems. I always think of one particular man in this context. When his marriage broke up, his children chose to live with him until the court decided where custody would lie. The mother came and took two of the children. The court finally decided that she would have custody but he would have access. He has been consistently denied access to those children. He cannot get near the house. If he sees them in the school, within five minutes the mother is there creating a fuss and she takes the children away. The children are now absolutely petrified of any contact with their father, even though they love him and want to be with him, because of the reaction of the mother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time he came to see me, I hardly recognised him because his health had deteriorated so much. He was a changed man. He looked at least 10 years older. Parents need to be able to sit down and work through with the other parent a parenting plan to accept joint responsibility. This will not work the same way with every family. This is why I think it is so important that the children be looked on as individuals, rather than property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency has been mentioned quite a lot by other speakers. Even though they are separate issues, there is a strong nexus between access to children and child support. I am sure all of us as members have had fathers come to us asking, `Why should I pay child support when I can't get access to my children?' I hope other members explain, as I try to do, that one aspect is not related to the other; that children have a right to be clothed, fed and looked after and that the father is as responsible as the mother for paying for those things. Access is a different issue. But I can well understand how that feeling arises. Those are the people who generally say to me, `I wish that there were still a guilty party in divorce.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many cases, the woman has left and obtained custody of the children, and the father has to pay child support. He asks, `Why am I the guilty person?' That is not helped by the tone of some of the letters from the Child Support Agency, which certainly makes the non-custodial parent often feel like a guilty party. We should get rid of all of those things. Again, it will not be easy. I think everyone here has talked about this bill and the whole family law issue being about people. People are different. No two couples will be alike. For some, it will be easy. For some, the war will continue to the grave. The bitterness, and sometimes violence, will still be there. But we are making headway, and I think this bill makes an enormous amount of headway. This bill is also part of the changing and the evolving of the family structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made a speech in this place earlier this year on the family. I talked about a report on the family by Shere Hite. She did research covering thousands of people in various countries. She concluded that those of us who have grown up in patriarchal families have been much damaged and that the family is now evolving. The family is more democratic and a place where there is more equality. This has come about also because more women are working now. Women are not seen as the home slave and role model for the daughters as a wife and mother. The result of that, I think, is that more women assert themselves and more women become more independent within the family. There is inevitably friction because sometimes people have married on the assumption that their roles will be different from what they turn out to be. That is certainly true over the period of the 1960s and 1970s, when there was a great change in the role of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this bill is a forward step towards making happier families, even though it is looking at families when they are probably at their most unhappy. I hope that it will continue to be reviewed, as the original act has been, and that we keep up with the times. I commend the bill to the House and hope it will receive universal support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to speak on the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2] as someone whose family has been through the trauma of divorce and separation and as someone who has also been involved in the counselling of friends, church colleagues and the like. It is a bit extraordinary that it has taken 20 years since the principal act was first introduced for the amendments that we are debating today to come about. When people talk about family law, they normally automatically think of the Family Law Act. The title `Family Law Act' is really quite misleading. It would be better described as the divorce act because it has little relevance to my personal concept of what family should be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original bill was supposed to be based on a series of principles, the first of which was that good family law should support, rather than undermine, the stability of marriage. I believe now it is a great tragedy that the central importance of family has been substantially undermined. The Family Law Act is supposed to provide that the court must have regard to a number of basic principles in its determinations, the first of which is the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. I have some concerns which I would like to express later about the impacts the Family Law Act has had on the shape, structure and the fabric of our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second principle is to reinforce the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family, recognising it as a valuable unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of children. The third principle is the means available for assisting marriage partners whose marriage has deteriorated&mdash;it is important to recognise that this does occur&mdash;to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other with the interests of the children at heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial platform of the Family Law Act is reflected in the replacement of the grounds for divorce based on matrimonial fault with a single ground: the breakdown of marriage&mdash;irreconcilable differences&mdash;evidenced by over 12 months separation of the parties. Here we are, two decades after the introduction of the Family Law Act, and this platform&mdash;the divorce of the parties&mdash;remains the only operational basis for the legislation; it has brought the need for the reforms we are debating here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way it has operated in the past can hardly be described as being about families. It seems that nowadays the easy fix divorce provides for a far too easy process for parents to absolve themselves of the responsibility they have to their children. Sadly, much of the emphasis is adult centred. More thought needs to be given to the rights and needs of the children. I am pleased to see that the proposals today go some way towards meeting that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neglect of the support for marriage and family is fairly obvious. Many speakers here today have made reference to that. If government funding is any guide, expenditure on the Family Court alone is four times the expenditure on marriage education and reconciliation counselling. If the cost of welfare benefits for sole parents is added to this, the cost to the community would be $3 billion a year. It is not centred on preventive maintenance or preserving marriage; it is centred on addressing the damage associated when marriages disintegrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The neglect of support for marriage and family reflects a failure on the part of the Family Court and governments over the past 20 years. The bias that I have observed against reconciliation is seen in the inadequate funding of counselling services. It is generally accepted that counselling services fulfil an important role in family law matters. The Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluated the effectiveness of marriage counselling in 1986. Its study found a reasonably high satisfaction rate amongst those who had used marriage counselling to improve their relationship and prevent its breakdown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The study also found that there were many couples who were provided through that counselling process with a basis upon which to separate amicably and so did not need to use lawyers or enter into a litigation process. It has led them into a more responsible way, in the interests of the children, to dissolve their marriage. The study by the Institute of Family Studies concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . public funding of approved marriage counselling organisations is a "very inexpensive way of reducing later costs in litigation, social security benefits and personal and social consequences" . . . funding of marriage counselling results in annual cost-saving to government of around $47.5m in terms of funding for Family Law Courts, Legal Aid and Supporting Parents Benefits.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite that finding, lack of resources for counselling has been a problem. Long waiting lists have existed. These have contributed to diminishing the effectiveness of any counselling offered because by the time the counselling is provided the relationship has long since deteriorated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many organisations not in receipt of any government funding have been carrying out marriage guidance counselling as part of their services. The criterion in the Family Law Act for the funding of marriage counselling is that marriage counselling be carried out as a specific function. A number of social counselling organisations have not qualified for that level of support. At least these reforms recognise the role they play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The failure to use the provisions of the act to promote reconciliation has been explained by some as a lack of agreement on what a family actually is. I do not think this applies because the Family Court is dealing with parties who are part of an existing marriage. My concerns lie with the emphasis, and I do not accept the principle that people are going to divorce anyway. Effort should be made to preserve marriage as a valuable social and economic unit. It is an emphasis issue, from my perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see some of these major issues being addressed in the parliament. The bill incorporates provisions designed to strengthen and facilitate the role that counselling, mediation and arbitration can play in family law disputes. That is a good thing. The bill will make voluntary organisations eligible for funding if they provide family and child counselling services, even though their major purpose is not necessarily family and child counselling. This change will enable organisations to engage in non family law counselling without jeopardising approval under the Family Law Act. Consequently, it should also improve the availability of counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of mediation is expanded by the bill and, through it, approved mediation organisations are given access to valuable government funding. I would hope that would be cost effective. The benefits of mediation are obvious in that it provides quick, inexpensive, confidential and non-confrontational advice. Like a lot of alternative dispute resolution procedures, mediation should produce a better outcome which is likely to be more acceptable to all the parties and, therefore, likely to attract greater compliance and a resultant decline in litigation and huge cost to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the only mechanism in the act as it currently stands to achieve any kind of effective result is support for education and reconciliation services, and because these have been neglected, there has been little practical support for marriage. I hope that this approach is now recognised as being very wrong and naive. Laws made in this place are supposed to mirror social change. It is true, as speakers from both sides have said today, that our society is changing, but I worry about whether the Family Law Act actually represents the changes in law which are engineering this change or whether it follows them or runs parallel with them. It is a very confusing picture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this sense, I believe the Family Law Act has increased the momentum with which some very dangerous cultural shifts have occurred which we might all live to regret. Another factor that has operated in the same time frame which has contributed to this cultural shift is the introduction of the supporting parent benefit, which came in at about the same time as the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The face of the Australian family has changed dramatically since 1975. At that stage, sole parent families comprised about nine per cent of all Australian families whereas today they represent about 13 per cent. Since that time, the actual number of sole parents has risen from 183,000 to 620,000. The overwhelming majority of these families, about 84 per cent, are lone mother families. Each year, about 50,000 children experience the separation of their parents. The number of children born out of wedlock is also increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst these changes demand reflection and discussion of the kind we are having here today, we should be careful not to adopt a jaundiced view on this. It is important to remember the fact that 85 per cent of all families in Australia remain couple families and that the vast majority of children are still growing up in intact two-parent families. Albeit the fabric of that family might be changing, they are still couple families. In other words, although it is said that one in three marriages fails, the majority of particularly married couples&mdash;two-thirds or 66 per cent&mdash;continue to choose the traditional family as the preferred option for the raising of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the effects of these changes and this culture shift have been considerable. Like many Australians, I have grave misgivings about the long-term impacts on the quality of society that this is creating. Of course I am concerned about the ever increasing number of single parents, who I believe are doing a remarkable job in raising children. It is tough enough for mum and dad to raise teenagers today but people who do it on their own deserve my wholehearted support and deserve enormous credit, and they have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a community, we need to ask some serious questions about the potential downsides to our society. It is clear that separation and divorce have contributed to the progression of poverty in Australia. Although estimated poverty rates for sole parents have been reduced over the past years by the actions of government through increased family payments, rent assistance and child support payments, sole parents still remain one of the poorest groups in the community. I judge that by representations I receive in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic cost to Australia in investing in marriage, in investing in sound family, is considerable. Supporting parents benefits rose from $160 million per annum in 1973-74 to $2.9 billion in 1991-92. Therefore, family breakdown costs Australian taxpayers some $3 billion a year, which is equivalent to roughly $600 per household. This is an economic question and, indeed, there is an economic imperative here for government to invest in sound marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Apart from the economic cost to society, there is also the question of longer term psychological harm, particularly to children. In its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our homeless children</EMPHASIS>, the inquiry into youth homelessness identified family breakdown as a major cause of thousands of street kids leaving home. A number of studies have shown that many children of separated families feel intense rejection. They feel anger and loneliness at the time of divorce and, whilst many overcome these problems over time, other children who seem to be adjusting well initially often develop severe emotional reactions to the divorce as long as a decade later, leading to a range of behaviour problems. Thankfully there are signs of some reassessment of what I would describe as this crisis in our society. It is pleasing to see the parliament responding here today in part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major area of dissatisfaction with the principal act has related to the treatment of children. Last year there were 15,485 custody guardianship applications before the Family Court and 14,971 access applications. Whilst property matters formed the largest single category of orders sought from the Family Court last year, matters relating to custody/guardianship, access and child support constituted 43.8 per cent of all the orders sought through the court. These figures are frightening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us addresses the language employed in the Family Law Act. The old language has encouraged adversarial proceedings and promoted the idea that children are the spoils in divorce proceedings. This needs to change. Children are not property; they are individuals. They need far greater consideration than has been received in family law  settlements. They are, after all, the Australians of the future, whose wellbeing is an investment in our own future. Thankfully the bill addresses these questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the bill that I am encouraged by is the introduction of the concept of `parental responsibility', `parenting plans' and `parenting agreements'. To me this reinforces the concept of responsibility. In a society like we have today, where the emphasis is inordinately placed on rights, it is high time we were all reminded of responsibilities. The bill introduces the concept of parental responsibility and particular rights for the child based on UN conventions. These changes, in addition to other changes in terminology, are designed to promote the idea that the interests of the child are paramount. I am a little concerned that we rely on a United Nations convention to tell us that. We are, after all, a responsible society. We ought to have been able to draw that conclusion ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to see the parliament establish a joint select committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate to inquiry into certain aspects of family law, and in particular in relation to the child support scheme, after a plethora of complaints. The committee received some 7,000 submissions and there were 150,000 attempts by Australians to contact the inquiry on a special telephone hook-up. This ought to indicate the magnitude of the problems that existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of the family as a valuable bridge between the individual and society is not new; it is an age-old philosophy. If children are loved by their parents and family members, they too will develop the capacity for love and respect for others and in this way feel good about themselves, respect others, respect authority, and provide a basis for future good citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the whole of society rests on the foundation of stability, understanding and social order that family can provide. There ought to be a greater emphasis on preserving that role of the family. It is a trauma to witness what happens to individuals when families have to deal with broken marriages&mdash;not just the immediate couple themselves but their siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law and a whole range of extended family. I have had to watch that happen in my own family. It is high time this legislation was brought to the House. I am thankful for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Family Law Reform Bill 1994 [No. 2], has four major sections under consideration: counselling organisations and mediation; primary dispute resolution; matters relating to children, including issues of terminology; and domestic violence matters. In response to the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, the government will progressively shift the focus of family law from litigation to a non-adversarial system. Participating partners will be encouraged to develop agreed upon solutions rather than need a judge imposed decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Divorce is very often an extremely traumatic event in the life of a couple, their children and their families. It is very likely that every member of this House has had some experience of divorce&mdash;at least second-hand, through close friends, brothers or sisters. We all know the dreadful pain involved and the high cost of that pain in terms of property, work and children. The imposition of a court settlement, often without choice as the divorcing partners refuse to compromise, is never an excellent development. Mediation to attempt to settle the stress of divorce sufficiently to allow some clear thinking and decision making is always a preferred option. Fortunately, this bill will help make mediation more the norm, and this is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Family Law Act was introduced in 1975, the then Attorney-General, the late Lionel Murphy, said that the system would not inquire into the cause of marital breakdown and that it would be an inexpensive system with simple procedures. Sadly, this vision has not been realised. Today, the system is unarguably overly complex, rigid and narrowly focused on traditional litigation. Because of this situation and the vast unhappiness that follows, the government is making a clear commitment to mediation and will progressively extend the availability of mediation services as rapidly as budgetary priorities allow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the success of mediation depends upon its being voluntary and a desire by the parties to actually find a mediated settlement. Mediation would probably not work in some cases where there is family violence or a serious imbalance of power in the relationship. There has been a pilot program involving mediation and, so far, the results are somewhat encouraging. Mediation resolved one of the major issues brought to the table by partners in 80 per cent of cases, and completely resolved all issues in more than 60 per cent of cases. More importantly, 90 per cent of participants using mediation have not started litigation, despite the fact that most of these cases involve difficult child and property disputes. Further evaluation of community mediation services is presently under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1994 budget, the Family Court system was given an extra $700,000 to extend its mediation trials. Another $1.4 million was provided for mediation services offered by community organisations, such as the marriage guidance councils, which have recently been renamed Relationships Australia. I recently attended a board meeting of Relationships Australia in New South Wales and I was very impressed by the dedication of this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not one of us here doubts the dreadful impact that an unhappy divorce creates. The economic effect is as profound as the social effect. In recognising this, the government will be looking at ways to raise employer awareness of the cost benefits of making counselling services available to employees. It will also consider education programs to raise community awareness of alternative dispute resolution and counselling services. Funding will be considered in the budget, along with other community education proposals on issues such as anger management, effective parenting, communications and dispute resolution skills, and the rights and duties of marriage and parenthood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a special plea to this House to emphasise the duties of marriage. In an age when everyone is aware of his or her real or imagined rights, the reality of duties is often overlooked. We will not be doing anyone any favours by downplaying the duty aspect of marriage. I call on everyone involved in marriage counselling to stress properly&mdash;especially before the event&mdash;the truth that marriage, family and parenthood require a long list of duties to be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many divorces are based on the refusal to face duties. These duties are integral to marriage and cannot be shirked if the marriage is to survive. Young couples should be aware of them from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 59 per cent of divorces involve children. We are all aware that far too often children are the silent victims of divorce, particularly when they are perceived as the spoils of victory in an adversarial court system.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committee found that failure to comply with Family Court orders, particularly over custody and access to children, is the major cause of dissatisfaction with the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To overcome this very serious problem, the government is looking at the terms of the United Kingdom's 1989 Children Act. This legislation emphasises the concept of parental responsibilities for the care and development of a child, which responsibilities decline as the child becomes more mature. Parents do not get `custody' and `access'. These are terms which reinforce the idea of ownership and see children as a prize to be won in the divorce struggle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These approaches are to be removed and parenting plans made available&mdash;hopefully, through voluntary mediation. These parenting plans will detail each parent's specific responsibilities. The Australian government has accepted this recommended approach in principle and requests that the Family Law Council examine this and other children's issues, including replacing in the act terminology such as `guardianship' and `custody' which help perpetuate the false notion of the ownership of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child welfare must always be the primary consideration of all court decisions. Children are utterly helpless in a situation of marital breakdown and have not of themselves been a cause of the breakdown. They are entirely innocent parties and they must never be victimised. Due to the problem over many years of divorced persons ignoring Family Court orders, the new legislation strengthens a clearer and stronger awareness of the compliance aspects of the Family Court system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that information about enforcement procedures should be annexed to court orders and that the Family Court will also investigate alternatives for the provision of information on enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government endorses the Family Court's current simplification project to make it easier for unrepresented people to prepare and present cases. Further to the compliance field, the government will look at amending the Family Law Act to empower the police to take temporary custody of a child at the same time as a warrant is issued for the arrest of a parent unlawfully trying to remove a child from a state or territory. Tougher compliance regulations have been necessary because of a number of attempts at abduction and perjury. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, these tougher compliance measures on their own can never adequately deal with the highly emotional situations where parents cannot or will not agree on the welfare of the child. Inevitably, the child becomes the real victim. That is why dispute resolution and counselling will be a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest reasons for family breakdown is the appalling situation of domestic violence. For a very long time, women, the principal victims of domestic violence, have been unable to receive prompt protection from this horror. The bill before us will give state and territory magistrates and local courts the power to vary Family Court access orders in circumstances of domestic violence. This will enable the victims of domestic violence to obtain unambiguous protection from the courts with one clear, simple and quick application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of violence in the home&mdash;tragically, a major source of marital breakdown&mdash;is not always as widely recognised as it should be. Obviously, many other factors contribute to marriage breakdown, but family violence is specifically one of them. I take this opportunity to mention some of the details which have led to so many marriage breakdowns as a result of this violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until there is some serious cultural and psychological change in Australia, I am afraid that violence against women will continue and that Australian marriages will continue to break up. This ongoing social and economic disaster will then continue to require further changes to family law. It is a vicious cycle that just keeps going lower and lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is exactly meant by violence against women? The National Committee on Violence Against Women defined it as behaviour adopted by the man to control his victim which results in physical, sexual and/or psychological damage, forced social isolation or economic deprivation or any behaviour that leaves a woman living in fear. Aside from the more culturally recognised physical and emotional abuse, such behaviours include the destruction of property, threats, harassment and ridicule. The key element in these circumstances is the desire on the part of the man to have control and power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will probably never know the actual number of women who are the target of a partner's violent behaviour. The shame and isolation that continue to be an intricate aspect of domestic violence in our culture act to maintain the secrecy for many of the victims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question and note the very considerable concern she has shown for farmers affected by the drought, particularly those within her electorate. I inform the House that last week I visited a number of severely drought affected areas in New South Wales and Queensland to see how we were going by way of implementation of the drought relief payment. I look forward this Friday to visiting the honourable member's electorate to see how things are going in that neck of the woods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought relief payment was part of the overall package of drought relief measures that was announced by the government on 21 September. My department has the  responsibility of implementing the drought relief payment. It is being paid at the jobsearch rate with the associated family payments that go with that. So, typically, a couple with two children between the ages of 13 and 15 should be entitled to a maximum of $380 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other key features of the payment, as well as its being paid at the jobsearch allowance rate, are the exclusion of farm assets such as farm machinery, livestock, et cetera; the fact that there is no activity test and that, by contrast with some other payments to drought affected farmers, it is not repayable. The payment is back payable to 1 October. Farmers who wish to apply need to get in contact with their rural adjustment scheme authority and get a certificate stating that they are  in  exceptional  circumstances  due to drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As of today, around 10,000 such certificates have been issued in the relevant areas of New South Wales and Queensland. The Department of Social Security has appointed drought contact officers throughout the affected areas in order to assist farmers to go through the mechanics of completing the forms. We have given considerable thought to appropriate methodologies for estimating income for the application of the incomes test that applies. At this point significantly fewer claims than certificates have been received, but the numbers of applications for the payment are rising rapidly. Again, as of today, there have been 4,216 claims received and they are continuing to come in at a rate of about 200 a day.</PARA>

Do you concur, if you do not apologise, with the views expressed in the minute written not by some official but by a person who is ranked among the third most senior officials within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr W.N. Fisher, to the department secretary, Mr Michael Costello, that Mount Isa Mines Ltd salesmen are `incompetently briefed and that they must be pushovers for the Germans and Japanese to deal with'? Do you also concur that some of the interventions by former and current presidents of the National Farmers Federation&mdash;Messrs Graham Blight and Donald McGauchie&mdash;and the Managing Director of MIM, Mr Norman Fussell, `were pretty appalling'? Are these comments really just akin to those by the former Australian Ambassador to Cambodia, Mr J.S.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously Australia has a very good record on human rights, and we have a very proud record of racial harmony and social tolerance in this community. However, I do not think anyone in this House or in the broader community would pretend that Australians from a variety of backgrounds have not suffered from time to time, and do not continue to suffer, discrimination in our community and have not been the victims of extreme racist behaviour. This was recognised as early as 20 years ago when this parliament enacted the Racial Discrimination Act. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission shortly followed the enactment of that legislation. Over the years we have had other pieces of human rights legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years there have been three major federal inquiries which have focused on the existence of racial violence and racial vilification in this community: the Law Reform Commission's report into multiculturalism and the law; the royal commission into black deaths in custody; and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report into racist violence. All three of those reports identified a deficiency in Australia's human rights regime and recommended that the Racial Discrimination Act should be amended so that complaints of racist behaviour could be made and conciliated and subjected to the processes of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The inquiry into racist violence also recommended that there be some behaviour which should be subjected to the provisions of the criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These conclusions have been shared by a number of state governments in this country, notably, the government of Nick Greiner in New South Wales in 1989 and the governments of Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. All these parliaments have passed legislation which, to some extent, either through their criminal laws or through their civil provisions of their human rights bodies, have established regimes which allow racist violence and incitement of racial hatred to be covered by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times&mdash;fortunately, these are not common occurrences but, unfortunately, they are not unknown&mdash;we have seen in Western Australia, in South Australia and I think most recently in Melbourne occasions of racially based violence in our society. It is to address that problem that the government is proposing to this parliament that there should be specific legislation to deal with the issue of incitement of racially based violence and the threats which flow from that. It has also been recommended to the parliament that the Racial Discrimination Act be amended to allow civil procedures in relation to this type of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are difficult issues. People can obviously come to different conclusions as to how this problem should be best addressed. However, I do believe that, while confronting racism, arguing about it and education on it are very much part of the proper response&mdash;indeed, that is fundamentally the role of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the Race Discrimination Commissioner&mdash;there is some conduct that is so damaging in its effect that there needs to be specific legislation and, in some instances, criminal law legislation to deal with it. It will be my intention to introduce this legislation into the House on Thursday. I look forward to there being a sensitive and sensible debate in this chamber and in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure you, Mr Speaker, it will be totally relevant. As the honourable member pointed out, there are a number of Australian states and, indeed, a number of countries which have enacted racial hatred legislation. I suppose the most extensive form of that legislation currently existing in Australia is in the state of New South Wales. It was introduced by the Greiner-Murray government in 1989.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the enactment of that legislation, there have been some 448 complaints of racial vilification made to the New South Wales anti-discrimination board. There have been no prosecutions under the criminal provisions. However, I understand that three investigations did proceed to a fairly advanced stage but did not proceed on the basis of the evidence at hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point I think to be made from that is that the existence of the law, and particularly the civil provisions, has enabled the anti-discrimination authority in New South Wales to successfully deal with a large number of complaints over the years and, in the vast majority of cases, to achieve a satisfactory outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to free speech, I do not know whether anyone could seriously advance that in the last five years the citizens of New South Wales have been somehow stifled in the expression of their views or ideas. I am not aware of any talkback radio host having been taken off the air in New South Wales in the last five years. I am not aware of any newspapers having been shut down, or articles having been edited, or anything of that sort having occurred. I do not believe that anyone could seriously contend that controversial&mdash;or even what could be regarded as very unpopular or extreme&mdash;views by the vast majority of the community have in any ways been stifled in the state of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the country which Australia would most look to as having a similar legal system and being similar in terms of the demographics and backgrounds of its people is New Zealand. New Zealand has had legislation of this type on its statute books since 1971. In that time many hundreds of complaints have been dealt with by the anti-discrimination authorities in New Zealand. Exactly the same conclusion can be made about the enjoyment of free speech within New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of free speech is a sensitive one, and any proposal which is put before this parliament or any parliament which in some ways infringes, limits or restricts the free expression of ideas needs to be treated with great caution. That is the approach which the government has taken both in deciding to proceed with legislation in this area and in the drafting of that legislation. It is not uncommon for there to  be laws which in some form restrict free expression. Obviously, in terms of the criminal law the commission of counselling someone to commit an offence is a restriction on the expression of that person. The offence of soliciting is very much a restriction on free speech. Clearly, our entire censorship regime, including our restriction on child pornography, is a restriction on expression in that sense. Provisions in the Trade Practices Act dealing with false and misleading advertising or false and misleading representations are restrictions on people expressing themselves in that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, a balance has to be drawn between the importance of free speech and the overall public good or public interest which could be served in its restriction. It is my conclusion, and that of the cabinet and caucus, that laws in the area of racial hatred, on that balance, justify introduction and support by the parliament. That is obviously a position also agreed upon by the governments and parliaments of New Zealand, New South Wales, Western Australia, the ACT, a number of states in the United States of America, Great Britain, Canada and other countries which also have these laws and indeed have had them in place for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will not be, and nor should there be, any restriction on free expression of media reporting on popular or extreme views.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. The Commonwealth is greatly interested in national consistency in workers compensation. People will be aware that currently the system is administered by the states and territories and the Commonwealth with respect to its own workers. That has led to a situation where there is no single national market in workers compensation and, therefore, no competition. So any competition in, if you like, best practice in workers compensation occurs between states rather than between enterprises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than employers competing on safety and seeking the best occupational health and safety record for their employees, as well as for the employers, we have a situation where governments are competing unnecessarily to bid for employers who may be running very poor workers compensation schemes. This has resulted in very inconsistent benefits and practices between the states. For instance, there could be dramatic differences between premiums for firms with identical safety records but operating in different states. For example, the premium in housing construction in Victoria is just 2.7 per cent but in Western Australia it is 8.1 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will. This has to do with competition and I thought the opposition might be interested in it. The level of compensation available to injured workers suffering identical injuries will vary widely between states. For instance, the statutory death benefit in New South Wales is $223,000, but here in the ACT it is just $87,000. In Tasmania the benefit for the loss of an arm is $50,000, but in Western Australia it is $90,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are enormous inconsistencies. For instance, after six months on compensation in one state an injured employee receives cash in hand benefits which may be barely little than social security payments, but in another state injured employees could receive the equivalent of their take-home wages. In one state, the maximum no-fault payout that workers suffering serious long-term injuries can receive is $72,000, which may be as little as two years salary to them, but in other jurisdictions, in other states, it is possible that the needs of those workers may be met for the rest of their working lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an enormous difference in the competition between states as to how much weight the employer carries of these costs as opposed to the community and the employee. For instance, the percentage of costs borne by the community in Victoria&mdash;which is either by government welfare programs or social security programs&mdash;or the worker is 44 per cent as opposed to 56 per cent for employers. In stark contrast, the percentage borne by the community in South Australia is just nine per cent as opposed to 91 per cent for employers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the plea currently that the states and the territories run workers compensation. The Commonwealth has made an offer to the states to negotiate national consistency so there would be no invidious competition for states to lower the standard of workers compensation. But it seems that the Commonwealth has an interest in establishing a national workers compensation system that is based on competition between firms and not states so that we can have some minimum acceptable national standards which are acceptable to all players. Currently, I am progressing talks between both employers and unions on a sectoral basis to see whether they can come up with nationally consistent schemes for workers compensation.</PARA>

The question of specific laws dealing with female genital mutilation was discussed at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Melbourne last week.

I am still hopeful that the government of Western Australia, seeing that all other Australian jurisdictions were moving down this path, may accept the spirit in which this matter is being progressed, change its position and adopt the Commonwealth's position.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Such claims are rubbish. I will come to that in a moment. I might make a few general comments about income distribution throughout the developed world. A number of studies show that throughout the developed world over the  1980s there was a widening of earnings differentials. Explanations of that generally end up going back to issues such as the globalisation of the world economy, the impact of technology and the impact of structural change on the labour market. What we know from international studies is that the countries that have experienced the most severe opening up of income differentials have been those countries that have comprehensively deregulated their labour markets. That is very clear. The United Kingdom is the country among developed countries that has experienced the greatest widening of income differentials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who in this chamber wants to undertake a wholesale deregulation of the labour market and the stripping away of the award minima? They do. For them to come in here and talk about growing inequality is sheer hypocrisy. If you look at the specific policies of the coalition to slash social expenditures and the proposals we have seen come from that side of politics on families, whether it is income splitting, Tony Abbott's proposals to have, in effect, a single rate of payment to all families based on the number of children or the policies relating to family assistance, the one thing these policies have in common is their extreme regressivity. Without exception, every proposal and suggestion from that side of the House has made the position of those on low incomes worse relative to those higher up the tree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government did over the 1980s&mdash;and this has been confirmed by a number of studies&mdash;was to counteract that underlying trend to greater earnings differentials through government policy through an efficiently and effectively targeted social security system, with major real increases in payments directed to those at the bottom, particularly increases in family payments and rent assistance. If you look at the social security payment structure measured against any poverty line, the outcome is absolutely unambiguous. Compared to when we came to office, things have improved substantially, both in real terms and particularly against any of the poverty lines in current use, whereas under the coalition things actually went backwards for people at the bottom of the income scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an overall assessment of this country's income distribution compared to the rest of the world, responsible commentators have emphasised that you cannot just look at cash incomes; you have to look at the social wage, at the benefits people derive from assets, at the various services that people are able to access&mdash;free medical care, education and so forth. If you are making international comparisons, you have to have comparable statistics. That is not a trivial matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major study has been undertaken over the past few years called the Luxembourg income study, which is a comparative study of 14 developed countries and in which an attempt has been systematically made to achieve statistics which are comparable between the various countries concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Sunday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) jets off to Jakarta where he is going to attend the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, APEC. As the Prime Minister has done during his previous overseas visits to APEC&mdash;and a lot of us would give him some credit for what he has done to promote free trade&mdash;he will again be promoting that concept and no doubt will be bleating on how well Australia has done. Yet in this last fortnight we have seen one of the most unbelievable backdowns by a government on an international agreement, namely, the Australia-New Zealand open skies policy for our aviation services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue today as a matter of urgency because the damage that has been done to this country and to the tourist industry is still to be realised. It is quite interesting that, at a time when the Asian countries within their own fora are talking about opening up competition and  particularly with the Organisation of Asian Airlines talking  about its free skies arrangement around Asia&mdash;and here is Australia allegedly leading the way and berating the OAA into going into a free market&mdash;what do we have? We have Australia reneging on an international agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite interesting that in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asian Wall Street Journal</EMPHASIS>, which is dated 10 November 1994, this issue has already been raised. Part of the commentary says that Australia has been sending a very negative message to Australia's APEC partners. This article suggests that Australia's commitment to regional trade liberalisation is rhetorical rather than real. That might be strictly correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the very origins of the open skies policy in February 1992 when the Prime Minister issued his One Nation package. The one thing that was highlighted and trumpeted by this government as being a major reform was the fact that it was promoting the concept of an open skies policy between Australia and New Zealand. It is quite fascinating to go back to the documents at that time and read some of the commentaries in the newspapers. A number of commentators thought that with the Prime Minister in his ascendancy there was to be a new broom in the relationship between the government and Ansett. Stories were abounding at that time that one of the prime reasons that this was introduced was that the government felt no allegiance to the old management of Ansett, that it did not have any loyalties to Ansett and that it was not there to protect Ansett. How things have changed now that Sir Peter Abeles has left Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In actual fact, I believe the issue that we are facing at the moment is about not only promoting the Qantas privatisation but also protecting Ansett. As the Prime Minister has admitted in a number of public statements, he is all about trying to get a merger between Ansett and Air New Zealand. We know the results of that. Air New Zealand has looked at the books and decided that it is all too hard. It will not cripple itself at this stage by having to take over a piece of Ansett. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will leave that to your imagination. You would not need much imagination to work out that there is a certain shareholding in the Ansett organisation that is very close to this government. This whole issue has been put on hold; this whole issue has been frozen. We are going to see some ramifications from that in Australia's growth and in the growth of the Australian tourist industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not here as apologists for Air New Zealand; we are here to highlight the fact that Australia's standing within the Asian community is going to be downgraded by this particular action. We are not denying that Air New Zealand has had some beyond rights and we are not denying that it is going to pick up some new rights, but the concept of the open skies arrangement between Australia and New Zealand is such that we had the capacity to lead the world in competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the early documents and look at the statements of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins, on the advantages that were going to come out of this process, what we find is quite incredible. On 1 August 1992, when Senator Collins signed the agreement with the New Zealand Minister for Transport, Mr Storey, we showed that there was going to be a build-up of services offered by New Zealand and Australian carriers, that we were going to have open arrangements between and within the two countries, that we would have optimum competition, and that we would see a greater liberalisation of the aviation services and, ultimately, a reduction in the cost of travel to Australian and international visitors into the region. At the time the opposition backed the government to the hilt on what this particular arrangement was going to bring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a week before the final episode of this particular chapter was to take place on 1 November, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), unheralded and unannounced, faxed his New Zealand counterpart to say that the whole deal was off. Then we went into the mode where the Prime Minister started making all sorts of excuses&mdash;the principal excuse being that the government was worried about the Qantas privatisation and the float that is due for next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1992, Senator Collins highlighted in his statement that this was going to help the Qantas float. He said that there would be a sense of certainty in the community about the arrangements. I suggest that, rather than assisting the Qantas float, the moves by the government in the last fortnight will probably put it in some jeopardy because nobody quite knows exactly what the arrangements are going to be further down the track. The Prime Minister came up with all sorts of other excuses. Most of them were quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was listening to the John Laws program in Brisbane and I got the shock of my life when the Prime Minister started doing the big bucket job on the free trade arrangement. He kept talking about Air New Zealand having 14 jumbos a week flying out of Australia and picking up passengers when, in actual fact, Air New Zealand has 5.5 jumbos a week. He attacked the single market because Air New Zealand was going to get the greatest share offer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does not know too much about beyond traffic, does he? The Prime Minister comes out with all this garbage when, in fact, the reverse is true. All honourable members have to do is go through the department's figures to see what the real story is. The figures on the fifth freedom traffic that operates between New Zealand and Australia are quite enlightening. Qantas manages to carry 200,000 people on fifth freedom rights over New Zealand every year. How many passengers does Air New Zealand carry out of Australia on fifth freedom rights? These are not Australians and New Zealanders travelling between the two countries; they are international tourists coming through. The answer is 50,000. It is two to one. This is really where the whole argument falls down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at an analysis of what New Zealand has done in opening up the whole of this south-west Pacific region, we find that the greatest advantage has come to Australia. I will be a bit parochial about this because some of the great advantages come to the south-east corner of Queensland. The analysis of the flights that Air New Zealand is bringing into Australia over Brisbane and then to Auckland is quite interesting. It would appear that the average number of Australian and New Zealand passengers using the service from Taipei to Brisbane and on to Auckland is seven, yet every flight is full. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to consider that something like 150,000 new tourists have come into the south-east corner of Queensland since this facility was made available. The reality is that there is so much traffic coming out of South-East Asia at the moment that I doubt whether Qantas and Air New Zealand ultimately will have the capacity to handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forecasts show that the growth in tourism traffic from Asia into Australia over the remaining years of this decade will be phenomenal. The growth is estimated by organisations such as the Boeing corporation at 25 per cent. We are looking at 140 million Asians travelling offshore for holidays by the year 2000. If Australia and New Zealand are to take their present share of the traffic, Qantas and Air New Zealand will have to triple their fleets in that period. That is a big ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have to ask whether or not this government will be for real in the promotion of the tourist industry. The investment now starting to build up in terms of new hotels in Australia is phenomenal. It is taking place in Sydney partly because of the Olympic Games and in places like the Gold Coast and Brisbane certainly because of the increase of international traffic by virtue of these flights out of Asia. There are four new hotels on the books on the Gold Coast, a couple sitting there in Brisbane, and Cairns has a requirement of five new international hotels. Whether the investment in those hotels may be in jeopardy because of the government move we are not yet sure, but there is certainly some doubt as to whether this government is for real in terms of opening up that tourist business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister at the table, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), shakes his head but, despite all the government's trumpeting, so far we have less than one per cent of the world tourism market. Thank goodness we have only got that. With the quality of investment we have and, indeed, the confidence of investment in new infrastructure here in Australia, we do not stand very high. While we might be doing very well at the moment, we have no idea of the potential if systems are opened up, if investment is allowed to take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The open skies arrangement between Australia and New Zealand was a tremendous opportunity to realise some of that potential. But there was another factor; that is, that part of the arrangement which allowed any carrier from either country to operate between or within either country. Subtitled on that is that the New Zealanders would have had the same opportunities to operate some limited domestic services in Australia as an Australian carrier has had in New Zealand. We then start talking about cherry picking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand probably would have run the Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and maybe Cairns corridor to carry that tourist traffic. But despite the trumpeting of the government once again about opening up the market to domestic competition, what have we seen? We have seen two attempts to provide competition&mdash;Compass I and Compass II, both of which have failed. At least in this particular case we had a very solid airline that may or may not have come into that market and given true domestic competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put the lie to this competition line. In the papers at the moment we are seeing full page ads for a number of specials&mdash;$149 from Sydney to Melbourne; $149 from Sydney to Brisbane&mdash;that will operate in the off-season. That is great and a lot of people have travelled under such schemes, but the reality is that the core fares within the Australian aviation network have gone up. If you want to see what can happen when you start limiting that competition, have a look at what is happening on the US route at the moment. Nobody will deny that the fares needed to be increased there to get some yield on them, but in actual fact the highest growth in airfares in the world at the moment is on the route from Australia and New Zealand to the United States because there is no capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be very interesting to see what happens because unless we get our arrangements right and unless we take advantage of that I have no doubt that the American carriers who have rights there will ultimately come back into that market when they start getting their act together. Looking at the resurgence of the American air carriers at the moment, maybe that is not too far down the track. We had this opportunity to really crank up the south-west Pacific market. We had this opportunity for maximum competition between our major carriers and, by virtue of the government's move, I think we have jeopardised that to a very great degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that worries me is that the words we are hearing from the government at the moment sound very similar indeed to those that were uttered by Mrs Thatcher's government in the early 1980s when it was trying to put British Airways up for privatisation. I have no hesitation in saying that I think that the British competition and privatisation program really has been a bit of a sham. What has happened over there is that, prior to the liberalisation of the British arrangements, British Airways had 80 per cent of the business; now it has 87 per cent of the business. It has been done through the collapse and decline of carriers like British Caledonian, Dan-Air, Air Europe and, of course, Laker Airways. British Airways has been in the courts of the United Kingdom and the United States paying out hundreds of millions of pounds in compensation to the carriers because of the various dirty tricks campaigns. At the moment there is more litigation going on in relation to the arrangements between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. We do not want that sort of thing to come in through an overprotected industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that, though this was a backbencher's presentation from the opposition, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) was due the courtesy of a ministerial response, because he is one of the members in this House who takes the tourism industry and the aviation industry very seriously. He has had a breadth of view on those issues over the years. I suppose his last few remarks indicate how broad that view is, since he criticised one of the opposition parties' ideological mentors during the last decade and the process of privatisation and competition that the Thatcher government went through. There is no doubt at all in my mind that, in the area with which I am more familiar&mdash;telecommunications&mdash;the combination of privatisation of British Telecom and the introduction of competition led to a wasting of competition effectively for a decade as a result of misplaced policies in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, despite those words of unusual praise for a member of the opposition, I take issue with the member. I think his concerns are overdrawn and that they do not do credit to the totality of the MOU that was entered into and the concerns that the government has; the continued generosity of the treatment of Air New Zealand by the government arising out of the initial memorandum; and the requirement to ensure that Australian interests are protected, including the interests of the tourism industry, in every decision that we take in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make one partisan point against the member opposite&mdash;since he made a few against us&mdash;despite his substantial role over the years in devising tourism policy for the opposition, when he last presented himself to the electorate, he was obliged to do so on the basis that he was proposing a 15 per cent tax on every conceivable aspect of tourism activity in this country. He found himself, no doubt to his great personal discomfort, greatly at odds with the various industry groups, lobby groups and airline organisations with which he has dealt so comprehensively and on such a friendly basis over the years. It must indeed have been distressing for him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, he saddled up, repaired his broken lance and sallied forth on the election highways and byways, and he got shot to pieces. I guess, for his own personal sense of satisfaction, he no doubt hopes that he will be able to run at the next election presenting something other than the proverbial sandwich that he operated with at the last one. He will not, however, find much comfort in this area, because his argument is overdrawn. You would almost have to believe from his remarks the notion that the opportunity for the airlines to effectively serve the tourism industry and the business community is a product entirely of a set of arrangements that were arrived at between Qantas and the government and between Air New Zealand and the government. That is hopelessly wide of the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was aviation minister back in 1983-84, the situation was this: Qantas had 23 competitors; there was a two-airline agreement in operation which was absolutely rigidly protected; no competition to the position of those two airlines in the market was permitted; the discussion of bilateral arrangements for Qantas to operate internationally was accompanied basically by no set of assumptions that the tourism industry would be served; entire consideration was on the balance sheet of Qantas; and the mercantilist principles which then prevailed, and still largely do, in international aviation had full reign. From the Australian point of view, there was no negotiation basically of Australian routes; there was negotiation of Qantas services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the picture today, after the years in office of this government? The picture is this: Qantas now has internationally 43 competitors operating into Australia&mdash;virtually double the number that was there at the time we assumed office. The massive capacity that has been brought into this country has, in large part, been a product of that&mdash;not of any agreement that we might have arrived at recently in relation to Air New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the areas where that competition was most manifest was across the Pacific. A situation, to which the honourable member referred, of some raising of prices and tightening of capacity in the Pacific has virtually nothing to do with any lack of entitlement to fly the Pacific and everything to do with the fact that the US carriers have stopped dumping on the market. Any reference to any consistency of practice by US carriers over time, I think, has to be very carefully considered. The likelihood is that, as they have started to get a decent price out of that operation, the US carriers will be straight back into dumping capacity on that market and the situation that we find ourselves in at the moment will be a purely temporary one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement that was arrived at in the memorandum of understanding does not have legal force; it is not a treaty. It is an agreement in which there are two sides. A variety of matters were addressed&mdash;not just simply the matters associated with any particular rights of a domestic market or on-carriage by Air New Zealand. There are elements of that in it, but there are other elements as well. Very important from the Australian point of view were common border issues which have also had attached to them more up-front the question of passenger facilitation between the two countries. There has been no progress in that area. As far as the government is concerned, it takes two to tango on these matters: if the memorandum is there for consideration, then the memorandum has to be considered on all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included in the statements made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) when he offered the advice to New Zealand, referred to by the honourable member, was the fact that there was a very generous provision of freedom rights. That was put in place in the course of those negotiations. Although not all services have been taken up&mdash;only those services across the profitable routes&mdash;I am quite aware that those services subsequently will be taken up. Those services amount to 12 per week and have increased Air New Zealand's capacity to undertake these activities by some 300 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not an invitation to Air New Zealand to fly to India, Bangladesh or any of the destinations which have not proved lucrative for entry into the Australian market. It was an offer to Air New Zealand, which it has taken up, to operate into the most profitable areas in east Asia into which our two carriers, Qantas and Ansett, operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst not necessarily featuring in any set of bilateral arrangements that Australia would have with any of those countries served, when bilateral agreements are entered into and discussions had on them as they are from time to time under the treaty arrangements, even though we do not directly negotiate access for Air New Zealand&mdash;that is a matter for the New Zealand government and its bilaterals&mdash;the capacity is certainly given consideration by those countries with which we have that relationship. Again, it is a question of it taking two to tango; it is not just one person who is involved. They have to agree to any set of propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be said that mercantilist principles sit strongly in the minds of those countries with which we deal in east Asia, and that is perhaps one of the reasons why the routes are so profitable. Nevertheless, the general nature of capacity into and out of the place sits at the back of their minds even though it is not necessarily on the table in the course of bilateral arrangements. So the concessions that have been made to Air New Zealand, which are still in force in the statement made by the Minister for Transport, are very generous indeed and, at least in terms of the Australian carriers, over time will operate in a deleterious fashion for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of whether or not there is an impact as a result of alleged hard dealing in regard to domestic cabotage rights impacting upon the nature of the service and the cost of it here, several points need to be made. The domestic air fares offered by Qantas and Ansett have fallen in real terms over the period since 1990 by over 22 per cent. At the same time, passenger numbers have increased by some 46 per cent. The opportunity is there for domestic airlines in Australia to establish an Australian personality and operate against those two airlines. In fact, Ansett operates in New Zealand with a New Zealand personality, not an Australian personality. Under the original terms of the MOU, New Zealand would operate effectively in Australia with a New Zealand personality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry to which the honourable member has referred is now served by a substantial change in the way in which the government arrives at agreements with bilateral partners all over the globe on capacity, which is no longer  dominated purely by a defence of one Australian carrier's rights. It is dominated by the fact that the government in those agreements goes in to bat not just for Qantas but for Ansett and other potential Australian carriers across those routes. It also goes in to bat on the basis of an understanding that we have let into this country something like twice the number of international airlines that operated in it at the time that we came into office. All of this has served to massively increase and improve the tourism industry, both domestic and international, in this country as the years have gone by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anyone claims&mdash;and even in his more generous moments this includes the honourable member&mdash;other than that the government has served the tourism industry well over the last decade. There will be, from time to time, the odd finagle and disagreement. There are certainly things in taxation arrangements and the like that the tourism industry would like of the government, and it constantly puts propositions to us in that regard. But the fact of the matter is that the tourism industry has been very well served, and the proof of the pudding is in the eating: a massive increase in tourism into this country to the point where I think it is now our second largest export earner after coal. That is a very substantial achievement indeed over the period that this government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member also referred to the requirement upon the government to establish clarity in all these areas by the time a prospectus is issued for the Qantas float. That is certainly the case. The Minister for Transport has indicated that he intends to do that, and he has time. This is not a matter on which we immediately need to arrive at a conclusion in the next week or two. He will discuss these and other matters with the New Zealand minister. In due course, a position will emerge that will be capable of incorporation in the prospectus that Qantas issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the points that I made at the beginning of my contribution. There is much more to that MOU than the question of Air New Zealand's rights in Australia. The other side of the equation, which related to a resolution of common borders, simply has not been proceeded with effectively by our dialogue partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a requirement in any reasonable set of agreements that all sides of the agreement be effectively capable of being upheld. There is an anticipation, too, that associated with any establishment of a single market there would be a resolution of ownership and control issues at the same time. There has been effectively no resolution of those either. That is our side of the argument as far as this particular set of circumstances is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat and draw attention again to the very substantial and generous treatment that Air New Zealand has been offered under freedom rights, most of which but not all of which it has taken up. The offers it has taken up have been in the highly profitable areas as opposed to the high risk areas, though I fully concede it will take those up as well. That was a generous act by the government. Our treatment continues to be generous. We have not withdrawn those rights that were put on offer at that point in time. In all the circumstances, I believe the government's actions have been entirely reasonable and in the interests of our tourism and aviation industries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

I do not mind so much if the ALP wants its reputation with the Australian people damaged by being dishonest and by saying things to the Australian people that are untrue&mdash;though I wish our political system had not degenerated to that level&mdash;but when the government is dishonouring our country and the reputation of our nation by wilfully walking away from an agreement signed in all good faith and upon which other parties and other governments have acted I think that is a disgrace to our country and the government should be ashamed of itself.

Frankly, that kind of attitude should never be accepted in this country. We have a clear obligation to honour the responsibilities and agreements that are made as a nation. Our government's action in this regard stands condemned. Let us make it quite clear that the government's response to this matter, its attitude to the open skies philosophy, has been quite unequivocal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as though Australia was dragged unwillingly into an open skies agreement. The One Nation statement brought down by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in 1992 stated that the Australian government was going to pursue the New Zealand government to obtain an `agreement to implement a single aviation market (including a common border) with New Zealand, allowing Australia and New Zealand carriers full access to the Australasian market. This would allow all Australian and New Zealand airlines to operate within Australia and New Zealand as well as across the Tasman'. The memorandum of understanding was signed in August 1992, and the open skies agreement was born. From November 1994, this month, Australia and New Zealand was to be one market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand responded to those principles and established, with some degree of investment, a commitment to providing services to and from Australia. Air New Zealand's commitment was evidenced by the investment of the airline and the effort that it put into developing services from the growth markets of Asia into and through Australia and by establishing Brisbane as an Australian hub. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand's efforts were limited to the equivalent of 12 services of 747s weekly. Air New Zealand has delivered an additional 50,000 international visitors to Australia who have contributed an additional $100 million in visitor spending and supported an estimated 2,000 jobs. With more beyond rights, this contribution would even grow. Every 747 has the potential to increase visitor spending in Australia by close to $1 million.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This very good decision is good news not only for the people of Brisbane and Queensland but for the whole of Australia in terms of employment and the expansion of trade and international services&mdash;none of which are growing more strongly than tourism services and airlines.</PARA>
<PARA>So it was quite clear that the government had an enthusiastic commitment to the open skies policy. The Prime Minister was waxing lyrical about it, promising Australia 10,000 extra jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one of the effects of the government's decision to welsh on this agreement has been quickly identified by the Queensland Minister for Tourism, Sport and Racing, Bob Gibbs. He has been quick to oppose the government's backdown and, of course, he is not a man without some influence in the ALP in Queensland. He just happens to be state president of the party along with being tourism minister. He rapidly pointed out the potential loss of jobs to Queensland as a result of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The airline's regional general manager, Mr Garry Court, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 28 October as confirming that a large number of potential jobs now may have been lost to Queensland. Air New Zealand is reconsidering the operations that it has been providing in the state of Queensland and the many jobs that have been made available in that state. So this whole move has a very significant potential impact on the tourism industry of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand wants to build up its efforts and investment in Australia so it can spread the benefits that have already occurred in Queensland to the southern states. But one week before the permitted start-up of this agreement&mdash;just one week before Air New Zealand was to develop a program to start services around Australia&mdash;the agreement was frozen by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand has been accused of cherry picking, picking the eyes out of the market. Let us remember where it made its commitment. Air New Zealand was prepared to set up at Brisbane's appalling international airport, offer services that Qantas has been neglecting for years and provide routes that are not available and which Qantas could have taken up but chose not to take up. It has been providing a service that Qantas declined to provide in so many regards. So to suggest that it is picking the eyes out of the market is ludicrous. It has been prepared to offer services that Qantas has neglected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air New Zealand has estimated that it is providing 50,000 extra international visitors to Australia as a result of its services. Some say that it is taking those services from Qantas. We have to ask, firstly: do we believe in competition or do we not? The Prime Minister parades around the world telling everybody we should have free trade. He goes off, as the previous speaker said, to international forums and lectures other countries about freeing up their markets, but he will not do it in relation to the services of Ansett  and Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is there this double standard? There are plenty of obvious reasons. The government is concerned about the threat to its own Qantas float, and it needs the money to help pay the unemployment benefits. But I think the real message became abundantly clear from no other source than the former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange. He was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today as saying that the real reason `had more to do with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation wanting to quit its 50 per cent shareholding in Ansett Australia than a breakdown in communications between the two governments'. David Lange, a member of the New Zealand Labour Party, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a faction in Australian politics which has certain debts and certain obligations and certain associations.</PARA>
<PARA>He hit the nail on the head. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This faction wants to get Rupert Murdoch out of his liability in Ansett-New Zealand. Rupert wants out of the Ansett group altogether, and Paul Keating tried to help and is still trying to help.</PARA>
<PARA>So the old mates syndrome is back in operation again. Laurie Brereton, king of the mates, is there again. The man who does not want to be industrial relations minister, who cannot run a shipping line and cannot run an airline&mdash;but does not want anybody else to run one either&mdash;is caring, again, for one of the mates by bailing him out of his problems with Ansett in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the process, hundreds of millions of dollars will be lost to the Australian tourism industry. The Australian and New Zealand governments commissioned a joint survey which estimated that there would be a $400 million dollar gain to Australia as a result of the open skies policy. That is now all to be ditched along with the benefits to local motel operators and tour operators who could benefit from the potential growth in the Australian tourism industry. None of that counts for anything when there is a mate to be helped, when someone needs to be bailed out. That is the reason the government has reneged on its responsibilities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member said that we should honour the obligations in the agreement. Yes, we will honour the obligations in the agreement, but we will do so in the manner that best meets this nation's interests and when the government of New Zealand honours its obligations under the agreement. To date, it has not done so. In New Zealand they are very good, with these kinds of arrangements and these problems, at whipping up the media. It is very easy to whip up opposition. When a foreign government can get the opposition in the Australian parliament working for it, it is really making a mark. That is what has happened here over past days, and that is what is happening here this afternoon. The New Zealanders have an obligation to honour the terms of that memorandum of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is not new. It has been boiling up for some time. It was discussed by the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister of New Zealand back in July and August. Our Prime Minister expressed his concern about the failure of the New Zealanders to carry out their obligations&mdash;and I will deal with the detail of that a little bit later&mdash;particularly in regard to passenger facilitation, rationalisation of the industry and a common border. That was four months ago, and officials have been talking about it for much longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear also that the New Zealand government does not want to go into passenger facilitation. It does not see a return on the money that needs to be invested to provide that set of procedures and operations. I want to emphasise the words of our Prime Minister on this issue. He said that what has happened in Australian terms is that it has been all give, give, give, and for New Zealand it has been all take. I will not have a bar of it. This is Australia, this is the Australian Parliament and it is our interests we are concerned with. If you want some numbers, just look at the trans-Tasman figures. In 1993-94, 2.156 million passengers crossed the Tasman. Air New Zealand carried 1.05 million of those; Qantas carried 821,000 and the remnant of Continental Airlines carried 58,000. So who is doing the lion's share of the business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times, New Zealand has been given approval to operate 12 services per week beyond Australia. Air service rights are a very valuable economic resource, and they ought to be managed in the best interests of this nation&mdash;not of the foreign nations or the foreign airlines that come to this country to share in our business. Those 12 services provide New Zealand with 3,600 additional seats per week on to places like Taipei, Bangkok, Osaka, Seoul and Los Angeles. That is a very valuable benefit to Air New Zealand and to the New Zealand nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the whole issue involved, it is very easy to see that Australia is being seriously disadvantaged because Air New Zealand, quite cleverly&mdash;you have got to give it marks for its cleverness; it always outsmarts the opposition and can pull it in to support its case&mdash;has picked the eyes out of the most valuable parts of the trade and it has gone slow on those aspects of the agreement that do not provide it with much return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealanders are superb at using the media in this country to whip up sympathy for the poor little New Zealand bleeder. David Lange was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today, and to my mind it is a masterpiece of mock generosity. He is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . allowing Ansett to fly New Zealand domestic air routes in 1987 without seeking reciprocal rights for Air New Zealand in Australia `was an enormous improvement of air services'.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me tell you the real story about the mock generosity that comes from David Lange, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand. New Zealanders were utterly fed up with the arrogance of Air New Zealand domestic services, with the unreliability and costs of those services, and they desperately wanted another airline to go there. So New Zealand approached Ansett. Ansett refused the first time; it was approached again. The minister rang Sir Peter Abeles a number of times and Ansett was finally cajoled and kidded into coming into New Zealand with a promise of great prosperity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Ansett New Zealand domestic services have been a financial quagmire. Who benefited out of this? Ansett lost, New Zealand got a better service and Air New Zealand got some competition&mdash;but there was nothing in it for Australia. We did not ask to go into New Zealand. The beneficiaries were within New Zealand. It is the height of hypocrisy to be putting forward to us that, in some way, Australia was being given a benefit by allowing Ansett to operate there. I am sure Ansett wished to hell it had never gone near New Zealand. It would be hundreds of millions of dollars better off. But it was brought in by the New Zealanders weeping and crying, who, some seven years later, are saying, `We did you a favour by letting you come in here to lose your money.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go back to the main points. Australia remains firmly committed to the concept of a single aviation market. It is because Air New Zealand has not been prepared to abide by the concept set out, as far as Australia and our government is concerned, that we have taken the steps that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, New Zealand is trying to use a single market for its own advantage, for access to Australia's domestic and international markets. Give credit to the New Zealanders and the management of Air New Zealand. They will pick the eyes out of the traffic. They are very clever at it. But do not let us be the fools by putting our jobs second to their jobs, and our economic interests second to their economic interests. We do not want an advantage; we just want good partners working together&mdash;a fair go for each side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A memorandum of understanding means that there is an obligation on each partner to carry out his or her responsibilities. It is a fair proposition, but in this case New Zealand has fallen short. We are not reneging on the 1992 memorandum of understanding. New Zealand is reneging on its obligations and that has forced us to say, `Enough, enough.' We have to look after Australia's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all that is happening and the New Zealanders understand that. They play the harp over here and suck in some of the opposition, some of the Australian media. They are very good at it; they are probably the world's best at it. But the bottom line is that Australia's economic and aviation interests have to come first. That is all this government is doing and that is all the Prime Minister has said. The Prime Minister has said that the New Zealanders just take from Australia, do not accept responsibilities and do not share what they should be giving us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government remains available for further discussions.

<PARA>Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1994-95, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the additional estimates for 1994-95. In these bills, parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1994-95 under appropriation acts Nos 1 and 2 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,082 million; $676 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $399 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and $7 million is sought in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by appropriation acts Nos 1 and 2, 1994-95.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After allowing for prospective savings, the appropriations sought represent a net increase of $717 million in appropriations for 1994-95, an increase of two per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1994-95 budget. While this is higher than the level of supplementation sought in 1993-94, it is less than the amounts sought in the previous two years. At the same time, the net increase does not impact on overall budget figuring as it is largely offset by reductions in the estimates of special appropriations. These reductions reflect improving economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the main areas for which the government seeks additional provisions in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1994-95 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the government. Although the budget figuring made allowance for prospective wage and salary increases, it is not practice to appropriate these amounts at budget time. Funds are now required to meet increases resulting from salary increases and they are included in the $167 million included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) for increased running costs for all departments and agencies. This represents an increase of 1.4 per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1). Other factors affecting running costs include the impact of actual compared with estimated carryovers from 1993-94, transfers between financial years as well as some additional funding for departments associated with various government initiatives which have been previously announced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of observations on this motion as the Chairman of the Procedure Committee. I start by making an observation about the remarks that were just made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). I share to some extent the concerns that he has about the extent to which it is necessary to pursue questions of this kind, but I must also acknowledge and consider the fact that I am aware that some women who occupy the position of the chair are offended if they are referred to as `chairman'. I think it probably simplifies it in a case like this simply to use a gender neutral term like `chair'. If it happens to be a fellow who is occupying the chair, then he can be referred to as `chair' or `chairman'&mdash;whatever he indicates a personal preference for. If it is a woman occupying the chair, then in the same way she should be entitled to indicate her preference for the title that she would use in that position without our presumption that she is not going to be offended by the use of the expression `chairman'. So I think we have just neutralised it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I do agree with the member for Bennelong in many respects, not just in connection with the question of gender neutral expressions but in many other areas, about a conscious attempt to restructure the language rather than to allow it more properly to evolve as it has done ever since&mdash;I will not say `mankind'; I would have to say `humankind'&mdash;we started to communicate orally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with the essential matter, the proposed changes to the standing orders, as the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) has indicated in the motion, are essentially of a technical kind. They have been endorsed by the Procedure Committee. I indicate my appreciation to the minister as well that, when the proposed changes were referred to the Procedure Committee for its consideration, there was one particular element among those that we believed would be more appropriately excluded at this stage and dealt with by a more comprehensive examination of the new procedures which the Procedure Committee will be pursuing from hereon in. I appreciate the fact that that was taken out so that more detailed consideration could be given to it by the Procedure Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In connection with that, I want to emphasise that these substantially new arrangements have now been in place for almost one year. There was an understanding that the operation of the procedures would be reviewed around the end of this year or early next year. I indicate for the benefit of all members that the Procedure Committee will be undertaking such an exercise and is currently in the process of preparing correspondence to go out to all members. Attached to that correspondence will be a list of particular elements of the changes. Members might like to give their attention to them and bring any suggestions to the Procedure Committee so that they can be part of that examination. The letter will go not just to members but also to any other people&mdash;such as the clerks and other officers of the parliament&mdash;who have an interest in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate to the Leader of the House that the Procedure Committee supports these particular changes. They are simply technical changes at this stage to some of the procedural arrangements. They are simply designed to either facilitate the arrangements or remove some unintended and unnecessary impediments which have been identified as a result of the technical operation of some of the procedures. I conclude with the comment that the Procedure Committee endorses the proposition of the Leader of the House that we adopt those relatively minor technical changes at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to also briefly comment on the matters raised by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). When I noticed on the agenda the item we are now debating I wanted to make one last forlorn protest about the intrusion into the language of a word like `chair' and the loss of a word like `chairman'. I, for one, am thankful that we are getting only the word `chair' and not that appalling word `chairperson', which I dislike enormously. I suspect that the feminist movement does not like the word `chairperson' either, because that has `s-o-n' in it and that is a male word. If you are going to exclude all words with any degree of masculinity in them, I fear that there will not be much of the language left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do prefer the term `chair' to `chairperson', but there is really no need to get rid of the word `chairman' at all because it is not a gender-exclusive word. The `man' at the end of `chair' does not have anything at all to do with the male sex. I am reliably assured and supported by the dictionaries that the `man' in `chairman' comes from the Latin word `manus', or hand, meaning the hand of authority. That hand of authority is equally present whether the person is male or female. So I am more than happy to use words like `chairman' to a woman or a man, recognising the authority of the office rather than believing it has anything to do with the sex of the individual. In fact, those who oppose this term may do their own cause a disservice by taking away from the authority of the office and placing too much emphasis on the gender of the person who holds the post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I recognise that the move has become unstoppable. It has been insidiously, by stealth, intruding on our language over some period. I commend the proposal to remove the gender-exclusive pronouns from the standing orders. I think that has merit. Many women are now part of the parliamentary process and that needs to be acknowledged. Let me compliment the government on eliminating gender-exclusive pronouns not just on 35 per cent of occasions but right throughout the standing orders, so the standing orders accurately reflect the circumstances that occur at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Words like `mankind', `manhole', `spokesman', `midshipman' and the like&mdash;which seem to be so offensive to the people referred to these days as feminazis&mdash;make up much of our language. They have never been intended to imply a sex or imply that a woman is not able to do the jobs involved just as well as, or better than, a man. In those sorts of circumstances, we do our language a great deal of damage for no value whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret the fact that the parliament has been caught up in this seemingly unstoppable force, insidiously introduced right through our education system. It is now in our schools and I do not think that future generations will even know of terms like `chairman'. That position will always be referred to in the future as `chairperson', although I hope that the lead given by the parliament may encourage more people to use the word `chair', which at least avoids some of the contortion that has been added to the language in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a brief comment about the Main Committee. I have never been a fan of the Main Committee but I have to admit that it has worked much better than I expected. The chamber lacks some atmosphere but as much as possible has been done to try to make that place a worthy room in which to hold parliamentary debates. Something is detracted from parliamentary debate that does not occur in this room but I recognise that it has enabled the parliament to deal with legislation in more detail, and that is to be commended. On that basis, the Main Committee may well have permanently entrenched itself in the processes of this parliament, and I will just have to get used to the fact that I wish it could all be done in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that at some stage we may deal with some of the less attractive changes that were introduced at the time the Main Committee came into being. For instance, the rostering for question time is a diabolical abuse of the parliamentary processes. We also need to re-address the hours as we have now had some experience with the current process. I welcome the earlier closures but we need to look at some degree of flexibility in sometimes sitting a little later to allow us the opportunity for an occasional meal break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is obviously not part of the motion before us at the present time. I hope it is not forgotten and that we will one day return to a proper question time and can again review the question of the hours. As far as the Main Committee is concerned, it is well established and I am going to have to overcome any regrets I have had. I have to admit that I have not yet had an opportunity to make a speech in that chamber, although I have been in the chair on a number of occasions. My main reason for speaking was to express regret at the passing of the word `chairman' from our language and to express some relief that we are at least having the word `chair' and not the horrible word `chairperson'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without wishing to delay the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) too long, I want to make some brief comments. I regret the sensitivity that has perhaps been shown by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) about the changes included in part one of the motion. I think that those changes to the standing orders reflect contemporary wishes of the Australian community. There has been agreement about the use of gender-inclusive pronouns. The term `chair' has come into common usage around the place and that is appropriate. Terms such as `chair' have been used throughout the standing orders, and these changes only tidy up the cases in the standing orders in which the terms have not yet been altered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the belated conditional support of the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss) for the Main Committee. I understand his comments about the atmosphere. That is something that we can perhaps look at but, certainly, the operation of the Main Committee has assisted not only the efficiency with which we look at legislation but the detail in which we have been able to look at it. As I have commented before, the proof of this pudding is in the eating, and I hope the measure has continuing support. I believe that the comments made by the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) that it is appropriate to review the overall changes should have the support of all in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will respond to the debate, which was a little more extensive than I thought it might be. When I initially moved this motion, it was nevertheless appropriate. These various changes are not inventions of the government but recommendations of the Procedure Committee for a change in the standing orders. The bulk of them do not go to the gender issues associated with the standing orders but are related to the procedures for the operation of the Main Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those that do go to gender matters involve, by and large, the inclusion of both gender pronouns in the course of the standing orders. So that where `his' appears, `her' appears likewise. The standing orders are a bit inconsistent on that count, because some have been altered to reflect that change while others have not. This motion does that to the lot of them. I cannot really see how there can be any conceivable objection to that form of gender inclusiveness. But one cannot really make the accusation of the language being murdered when both words being incorporated into the standing orders have pretty common usage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the term `chair' merely reflects the fact that language changes from time to time. Shakespearian English is beautiful, but it is not now in use. I do not think we consider the English language to have been murdered because that style of English is no longer in use. The fact is that for political and social reasons&mdash;a whole range of reasons&mdash;our language is changing almost on a year to year basis. </PARA>

But the process which we have gone through in the past has been completely obviated. The reason for that is that something like 30-odd bills have gone through the Main Committee without the gag. Members have had the opportunity to fully discuss them, albeit that they are the sort of non-controversial things which would have appeared on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper </EMPHASIS>in a guillotine for a half an hour or an hour's discussion&mdash;and there would have been half an hour or an hour's discussion. </PARA>

When they have talked themselves out, that is the end of the matter. The effect of the Main Committee on the decency of procedures in the House has really been quite manifold. But, while we have incorporated it into the standing orders, as opposed to sessional orders, so it therefore stands for all time until altered by the House, it is still in the experimental phase. We will probably have to constantly receive advice from the Procedure Committee about adjustments that we ought to make to those standing orders to ensure that what is a very good innovation continues to proceed effectively. </PARA>

This is a frightful figure when one realises that these 2,200 calls in one month represent a small fraction of the actual total. That total could be anywhere from 10 to 50 times the reported figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A calculator is not required to see that violence against women is tragically well entrenched in parts of Australian society. There are claims that between one-fifth and one-third of all households in Australia are the site of some level of violence against women. A review of the literature on this topic is quite sobering and not a little uncomfortable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the 1980s, the Office for the Status of Women monitored attitudes to domestic violence. The report concluded that not only was there evidence of higher levels of violence but also there were clear signs of overseas born women and Aboriginal women being further disadvantaged through cultural isolation and the failure of shelters and assistance organisations to meet their cultural needs. Other studies have identified particular migrant women&mdash;particularly Asian women who marry through networks and Muslim women in arranged marriages&mdash;as often, but not always, being at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A common misconception concerning violence in the home directed towards women is that it is alcohol based. This is only true in about half the cases. The other half are caused by non-intoxicating factors. Fortunately, the situation is not utterly bleak. Over the past 20 years, Australian governments&mdash;state and federal and Labor, Liberal and National Party based&mdash;have worked steadily at the outskirts of this problem. I say this not in any sense of criticism; I know that the basic problem is an individual, cultural and psychological one that is not completely accessible to government action. Sadly, the situation will be with us until a different cultural circumstance takes place in an individual's life. The government can only do so much. No government of either persuasion has ever been cold-hearted or indifferent in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the approach by all governments besides tightening the compliance provisions&mdash;something this bill does&mdash;has been to spread education on these matters of violence throughout the community. Fortunately, these attempts to help difficult situations get better have had strong bipartisan support in this and previous parliaments. This level of bipartisanship is what the community wants. We should make an even greater effort to discuss and formulate legislation that attracts a high degree of general consensus rather than find some technical point that reduces a piece of legislation into being passed on party lines. Australians want unity, not division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my remarks on this bill, I hope that this legislation can help break the generational cycle of violence and shattered marriages. The work initiated by the National Council on Violence Against Women must continue. The Commonwealth has made a commitment to the aims of the council by providing nearly $2 million until June 1997 to extend work under the national strategy of violence against women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, one can say that the glass is half full. Changing a culture that is permeated with attitudes supportive of violence towards women will not be quick or easy. However, this bill and other initiatives can give us some hope that we may finish this decade with fewer bashed wives, fewer divorces and a great deal less of the awful emotional stress on children and other family members that is brought about by divorce. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When family law is mentioned, most Australians think of the Family Law Act, which is a statute that was enacted by this parliament in 1975. The enactment of that bill in 1975 reflected changes to matrimonial laws in much of the Western world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to 1959, divorce law in Australia remained under the jurisdiction of the seven states. In that year, the Commonwealth government, pursuant to section 51 of the Australian constitution, introduced its own legislation in the form of the Matrimonial Causes Bill. The effect of this bill was to consolidate the laws of the states into a code of general application throughout Australia. That act provided 14  grounds of divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Commonwealth parliament subsequently dealt with the formalities of the creation of marriage in the Marriage Act 1961. Fundamental changes were then proposed when former senator Lionel Murphy, the then Commonwealth Attorney-General, introduced a series of bills in 1973 and 1974, culminating with the Family Law Act in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tracing the normative influence of the Family Law Act, it is necessary to trace the two fundamental principles which underlie this legislation: firstly, the centrality or importance of family in society and, secondly, the rights and obligations of spouses both during the marriage and upon its dissolution. Many people, when they hear that the Family Law Act was intended to reinforce family and marriage, are surprised that that notion is one of the underlying principles of the legislation. Yet it is quite clear from the debates in the parliament leading up to the introduction of the act and the terms of the legislation that this was one of the pillars upon which the edifice of family law was constructed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a series of debates prior to the enactment of the Family Law Act, reference was made to United Nations documents, in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which former senator Lionel Murphy referred in his second reading speech. This international covenant recognises the centrality of family in society when it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.</PARA>
<PARA>The covenant also provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States parties to the present Covenant shall take appropriate steps to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution. In the case of dissolution provision shall be made for the necessary protection of any children.</PARA>
<PARA>The Family Law Act is quite clearly built on these two pillars which are set out in the international covenant. Hence, the bill introduced in 1973, upon which subsequent bills were drafted, was based on a series of stated principles, the first of which was that `a good family law should buttress rather than undermine the stability of marriage'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central importance of family was explicitly recognised in section 43 of the Family Law Act. This section provides that, in making any adjudication, the court must have regard to a series of factors: firstly, the need to preserve and protect the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life; secondly, the need to give the widest possible protection and assistance to the family as the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children; thirdly, the need to protect the rights of children and to promote their welfare; and, fourthly, the means available for assisting parties to marriage to consider reconciliation or the improvement of their relationship to each other and to the children of the marriage. The parliamentary debates of 1974-75 indicate that these provisions were afforded considerable weight in those debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other pillar of the Family Law Act is reflected in the replacement of the grounds of divorce based on matrimonial fault with a single ground; namely, the breakdown of marriage evidenced by 12 months separation of the parties. Two decades after the introduction of the Family Law Act, this pillar&mdash;namely, the divorce of the parties&mdash;remains the only operational basis for the legislation. The neglect of support for marriage and family is obvious. If government funding were the only measure, expenditure on the Family Court alone would be fourfold the expenditure on marriage education and reconciliation counselling. If the cost of welfare benefits for sole parents were added, the figure for the cost of marital breakdown in this country would be conservatively estimated&mdash;I emphasise the word `conservatively'&mdash;at some $3 billion a year. The neglect of support for marriage and family reflects the failure of will on the part of the Family Court and governments over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to comment on a number of aspects of this bill against the broad, general background of the underlying pillars of the legislation. The first relates to the notion of parenting plans which has been introduced to replace the terms `custody' and `access' in the current legislation. This arose as a recommendation from the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act in November 1992. In turn, the committee's report and recommendations were based on the Family Law Council's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Patterns of parenting after separation</EMPHASIS>, in which the Family Law Council said that the broad aim of a parenting plan was, firstly, to promote a wide acceptance of the idea that separating parents have a responsibility to cooperate in making joint decisions about arrangements for the care of their children and, secondly, to encourage the use of alternatives to litigation, such as conciliation or mediation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These parenting plans have been introduced in the United Kingdom via the Children Act. They have also been introduced in a number of states of the United States of America. Whilst support from the Family Law Council was advanced for this notion in the report of the joint select committee, it is interesting to note that the Family Court was much more cautious in recommending parenting plans. The Family Court's submission suggested that parenting plans may not offer sufficient protection for children at risk. That relates to the proposal which has been advanced previously in this place by members on this side of the House that that aspect of the legislation ought to be looked at in more detail in another place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises questions about the effect of divorce on children, which is quite clearly the intention of the legislation. The whole issue of the effects, particularly the long-term effects, of divorce on children was touched on in a book by Judith Wallerstein and Sandra Blakeslee which was published in 1989. This book was described as the first ever long-term study of children and divorce. In this book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second chances: Men and women and children a decade after divorce</EMPHASIS>, Wallerstein and Blakeslee reported that many of the children of 60 middle-class divorced families from the San Francisco area, which they studied over a 12-month period, experienced difficulties in education and social and interpersonal relationships. Many of the children felt intense rejection, anger and loneliness at the time of divorce. While some of them resolved these problems over time, other children who seemed to be adjusting well developed severe emotional reactions to the divorce 10 or 15 years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wallerstein found that, 10 years after their parents had divorced, 34 per cent were depressed, could not concentrate at school, had trouble making friends and suffered a wide range of other behavioural problems. The remaining children were doing well in some areas but were faltering in others. In an article published in the magazine accompanying the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>, Wallerstein described the 37 per cent as a `powerful statistic' and declared:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be hard to find any other group of children&mdash;except perhaps the victims of a natural disaster&mdash;who suffered such a rate of serious psychological problems.</PARA>
<PARA>The publication of this research sparked widespread debate about the impact of divorce, particularly on children. That debate is continuing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to quote a couple of passages from the book which touch on this issue. In dealing with the notion of custody, access and parenting arrangements, there are some interesting observations not only in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second chances</EMPHASIS> but in some subsequent studies which have been undertaken. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second chances</EMPHASIS>, Wallerstein and Blakeslee, in dealing with this subject, say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the joint custody children resemble not so much children from intact families but rather children raised in traditional sole custody households. About half are developmentally on target, happy and spontaneous at home and at school, while an equal number are anxious, having difficulty with peers and showing symptoms such as insomnia, phobias, and withdrawal, not unlike children this age in sole custody. Joint custody does not undo the child's distress. The central worry for young children in both custodial arrangements remains the same: fear of abandonment. The creation of two homes, from the child's perspective, still adds up to less stability than the one home where mother and father live together with the children under one roof. Moreover, the transitions between the two homes can easily reinforce anxiety about constancy and reliability of people and places.</PARA>
<PARA>They go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two years after divorce, children raised in joint custody households are no better adjusted than children raised in sole custody homes. Despite more access to both parents, joint custody children show neither less disturbance nor better social adjustment than sole custody children. Unfortunately, joint custody does not minimize the negative impact of divorce on children during the early postdivorce years. The custody arrangement itself exerts but a minor influence on the psychological adjustment of children. Other, more familiar factors weigh more heavily&mdash;the mother's anxiety or depression, the parents' emotional functioning at separation, the amount of conflict between the parents a year later, the age and sex of children, and the children's temperaments.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear on the basis of this study that, whilst there may be some advantages in the sorts of arrangements proposed in this bill, it is certainly not a panacea to the problems created by divorce. Towards the conclusion of this chapter the authors say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its best, joint custody enables children to maintain a close relationship with both parents and to enrich their lives with membership in two functioning households. At its worst, joint custody can lock children into a destructive relationship with a violent or otherwise inadequate parent or into a continuing, bitter struggle between angry parents, so that the child runs the gauntlet in both homes&mdash;and feels that he or she has no home anywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worse, perhaps, joint custody exposes the children of divorce to a potential but devastating psychological blow: If and when a parent pulls out of joint custody, there is absolutely no way the child can attribute his or her loss to the parents' rejection of the marriage. The child can only perceive in his or her heart that the loss of commitment is really rejection of the child himself or herself.</PARA>
<PARA>Even though the terminology is different and they refer to joint custody, what we are dealing with is a notion which is picked up in this bill in terms of parenting plans. It is a notion which I think we will need to monitor very closely if this legislation comes into operation in its current form. There have been subsequent studies undertaken not only by Wallerstein but also by others in America. Time permits me to mention only one of these, but it does reinforce some of the matters which they found in the first study. A further study published in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pediatrics in review </EMPHASIS>stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there was no clear evidence that children were better adjusted in either custody type, joint custody has highly related to more frequent access/visitation, and we found consistent evidence that children who had more frequent access to both parents were more emotionally troubled and behaviourally disturbed.</PARA>
<PARA>I interrupt that quote to say that the object of this parenting plan is that children can go from one house to the other and they can do so in a way which will mean they are going to be less emotionally disturbed. It is interesting that, as the authors expected, the studies found quite to the contrary. Therefore, it seems to me that there are real concerns about what is being envisaged in this legislation. I return to the quote from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pediatrics in review</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children who shared more days each month with both parents were significantly more depressed, withdrawn, and noncommunicative, had more somatic symptoms, and tended to be more aggressive, according to the perceptions of their parents. Boys, in particular, were less socially competent: that is, their school performance, involvement with friends, and outside activities appeared to be disrupted by more frequent movement between parental homes.</PARA>
<PARA>The rationale for the removal of the terms `access' and  `custody' and the introduction of the parenting plans and orders is the anecdotal evidence which is brought forward, and which I accept, that the notion of custody implies winners and losers, that is, somebody wins the battle for custody and therefore somebody loses the battle. Because of that notion, there are people who feel that they have gained something or who are bitter because they have lost something, namely, the custody of and access to their children. Therefore, that continues a cycle of aggression or bitterness between the formerly married spouses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason alone, I support the introduction of this notion, but with the qualification that the studies that have been undertaken indicate that this is certainly no panacea. They indicate that the object which is sought by this sort of change in the legislation may in many cases not be achieved and in fact the opposite consequence may be the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason I support this legislation in general terms is to go back to my opening remarks about the twin pillars of this legislation, which involve both rights and responsibilities, and that over two decades the notion of responsibility and obligation seem to have been lost. At least this legislation is some attempt in a small way to bring back into the legislation a notion of responsibility which places on the parents a sense of obligation to come to some arrangement in respect of the children of the marriage. However, it is a very limited response and one which certainly does not go to the heart of the problems in the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available to me, I will touch briefly on one other matter, and that is the provisions in proposed new sections 14C and 14D of the legislation which encourage mediation and counselling. It is interesting that comments have been made about how this will improve the situation. If we look carefully at the wording of proposed new section 14C, we find that it simply says that a judge must consider, from time to time, the possibility of the reconciliation of the parties; and proposed new section 14D says that a legal practitioner must consider, from time to time, the possibility of the reconciliation of the parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that, if one looks at the evidence of the Family Court itself, this is simply window dressing. Speaking in 1991 the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Justice Nicholson, conceded the failure of the supportive provisions in the legislation when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally it was thought that the court would play a role in the promotion of reconciliation, but the experience of the past 15 years has been that by the time that a couple approaches the court, there is little room for reconciliation, and such reconciliations that do occur are of uncertain and doubtful duration.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we have basically an encouragement to the court to do what it has already been encouraged to do in the original legislation. I suspect that this is simply window dressing and is not going to have any real effect in terms of seeking further counselling in a different form. At the present time, the counselling which is provided through the Family Court system is conciliation counselling. That is, the object of the counselling is to bring the parties together to mediate their differences through the divorce process and that they do that in a way that does not involve as much bitterness and perhaps does not involve litigation to the same extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reconciliation counselling, which is aimed at reuniting the spouses, has been largely consigned to marriage counselling agencies. The bias against reconciliation counselling&mdash;that is, the bias against obligation and responsibility in this legislation or the way in which it has been enacted&mdash;is further reflected in the inadequate funding of counselling services. If we look at the funding of preventative programs, we find that marriage education gets just over $1 million and marriage counselling in the latest figures gets something like $15 million, yet we know that each year conservatively it costs the nation some $3,000 million in the costs of family breakdown, separation and divorce. There is no balance whatsoever in terms of providing the support for that other pillar of the Family Law Act, namely, the obligation and responsibility of parties to enhance, support and encourage marriage and family life in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I submit to the government that, if it is serious about bringing about some real changes that will enhance family life in this country, particularly in this International Year of the Family, it needs to address the other pillar which underlies the Family Law Act and not simply play around the edges of provisions. This is the most inquired into and examined act of law in Australia, with the possible exception of the Income Tax Assessment Act, yet here we are almost 20 years after the introduction of the Family Law Act and the same problems exist. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We have in Australia a major social and cultural problem&mdash;the breaking down of the Australian extended family and the associated community values system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should never forget the enormous social cost of family breakdowns to families and the community as well as the economic cost. Every day in our community, we witness the breaking down of family values, which can be directed to the laissez faire attitude we have towards the importance of the family. We are often reminded of the negative effects of family breakdowns in the attitudes and behavioural problems of our children. We have many community actions impacting upon the family. Through the growth of political correctness, we have stopped supporting the vital need to protect the need for the extended family and its importance to the community. However, the broader community needs to accept that family breakdowns, as uncomfortable as they make us feel, are a part of our evolving community, sad though it may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Family Law Act was long overdue when it was introduced in 1975. We had the situation where blame needed to be apportioned with divorce. There were many relationships that were not loving and even violent. It was an act which the community wanted and needed. At the time, on the figures available, to give an indication of the divorce rates, we could see that divorce law reform was needed. Prior to 1975, on a per thousand basis, statistics indicate that four women per thousand had divorce status. Soon after 1975 this increased dramatically to 19 per thousand and now it is steady at 11 per thousand. We now have in Australia about 45,000 divorces every year compared with about 120,000 marriages. Estimates are that marriage is likely to end in divorce in about 40 per cent of first marriages. In second marriages the likelihood of divorce is around 50 per cent and, if you want to go for the trifecta, the divorce rate is even higher in third marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As traditional carers find new roles, the pressures of family life and financial needs during difficult economic times has meant that family breakdowns have become more common. Divorce is having a significant impact upon the community, and the most recent harrowing statistic was that single parents are one of the poorest groups of Australians within our community. It should be remembered that about 83 per cent of single parents have come from marriage. I pose these rhetorical questions: why is this happening? What are we doing wrong when we have these laws to help us? Or is the Family Law Act, so much wanted in 1975, beginning to impact upon our community in a very negative sense?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I and the coalition welcome family law reform because it is quite clear the current law is not effective for the community needs of today. It seems its time has passed and it is in urgent need of reform. This bill goes some way to addressing these urgent needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1975 act tried to reduce the process and costs associated with the divorce system. However, we have a system now which is complex, costly and focuses too narrowly on traditional litigation. The current system is an ugly adversarial system which determines, by perception, a winner and a loser. Yet I imagine that the reality is that all parties are losers, with the biggest loser more often than not being the children associated with divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ten years ago the biggest fear amongst children in Australia was a nuclear holocaust. They feared the bomb and what it could do to the world. Now reports indicate the biggest holocaust fear that children have is the parting of their parents. Divorce must be very serious if the children of our nation consider the worst thing they should fear is the parting of their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marriage is a marvellous thing. Most of us who choose to move into marriage do so with high emotion and mostly subjective decision making. We have no need for contracts or arrangements of property prior to going into a marriage. We do not recognise any of those things, because we are totally and utterly high on emotion and all we need is a certificate of marriage to legitimise our act. There is no need for counselling because we assume that love will conquer all. Yet the current divorce arrangements and the current rates of divorce illustrate that we need a clear view of marriage and its effect on ourselves and the community. The current divorce arrangements are very much a legal routine&mdash;something we never think about when we enter into marriage. As I said before, perhaps we should all consider why 40 per cent of first marriages are likely to end in divorce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So love really cannot conquer all, but in relation to divorce the current act does. It is interesting to note government expenditure on these matters. For marriage and, in particular, premarital counselling, we as a nation invest the stunning amount of $1.1 million or thereabouts per year. That is a very stunning amount when compared with expenditure in other areas. Perhaps we should encourage greater participation by couples in a wide range of counselling pre marriage, during marriage and during marriage breakdowns. Perhaps consideration should be given to teaching young Australians not specifically about the dynamics of marriage but about the dynamics of relationships at a much earlier age. We put a lot of emphasis on relationships when discussing them with children in their teens, but we do not seem to be addressing the notion of education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A conservative estimate of expenditure on divorce in Australia is a staggering $3 billion. We spend around $3 billion a year on divorce and associated matters, and only $1.1 million on marriage or premarriage counselling. This $3 billion figure is quite astonishing. Although I do not wish to play politics on this issue, it is important to know of this difference in expenditure as it continues the Labor government's idea of how to solve problems which is to spend money on the cure of the community ills rather than focus or attack the prevention of community ills. The government seems to throw a lot of money at the problems of social security, health and even Aboriginal affairs to solve them rather than being strong and convicted enough to develop policies of prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe our community should be working towards keeping families together rather than promoting divorce. Although we do not go out of our way to promote divorce, we seem to make it much easier for people to move in and out of relationships these days. That is not to say that they should not. There are a lot of relationships that break down because they are violent or traumatic. I think we should be placing more emphasis on premarriage counselling, assistance and education. What assistance can we give to young Australians in developing their appreciation and knowledge of relationships? I think this can be directed straight back to education. I believe we are not doing enough in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The splitting of a former loving couple does not end at the distribution of accumulated assets and the determination of the responsibility of parenting. It also involves the extended family. Grandparents do not stop loving their grandchildren because their children get divorced. Aunts and uncles and cousins do not stop loving their relations because someone gets divorced. Yet we seem to be ignoring these people when it comes to divorce. We have no provisions anywhere for grandparents to continue their relationship with their grandchildren. If a couple divorces, the extended family disappears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was at a committee meeting in Sydney recently on Aboriginal affairs, at which an Aboriginal woman expressed her concern about the breaking down of the Aboriginal extended family.

We should be concerned about the breaking down of extended families. What is replacing extended families at the moment? None other than government services. Government services have a lot to be commended for, but I do not think they replace the notion of extended families and the benefits coming from them. Our current family laws do not consider these aspects of extended families; I believe it is time that they did. I am given to understand that some further reform of this act&mdash;other than through this bill&mdash;will occur either this year or next year when more reports are tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family law court matters relating to children constitute the second largest section of matters requiring settlement in the Family Court. It seems that children are the ultimate discriminated against group in the process of divorce. Yet we continue not to seek solutions which are beneficial to the children of broken marriages. This bill goes a small way towards addressing these issues; but in my mind the reform in the bill does not go far enough, and we as legislators should be treating this matter with urgency. Just as the causes of marriage breakdowns are multifaceted, so too are the methods we should be employing to reduce the negative consequences of marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole concept of the Family Court is one based on conflict. We should perhaps review the court system; in particular, I question the need for the court at all and the high costs associated with running it at the moment. For instance, why are we not placing more emphasis on mediation to seek solutions rather than on a court process which increases costs and places huge demands on legal aid, which usually goes to only one of the people requiring the divorce. Legal aid cannot go to both people requiring a divorce. That process leads to an adversarial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We place too much emphasis on judges having the wisdom of Solomon when it comes to the best future prospects of the child. These judges may be great property arbiters, but what qualities do they have above others when it comes to human relations? Of course, they are only humans themselves and they do not have the great wisdom of Solomon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biggest challenge we are faced with is the custody provisions of the family law. That is indicated by the enormous file that I have in my office about these problems. Some of the proposals of the bill look directly at this challenge. In particular, the altering of the perception of the terms `custody' and `access' is an important and highly relevant initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill acknowledges some of the principles drawn from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The first principle is that children have the right to know and be cared for by both parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married, or have never lived together. The second is that children have a right of contact, on a regular basis, with both their parents and with other people significant to their care, welfare and development&mdash;which, I assume, would include the extended family. The third principle is that parents share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children. The fourth is that parents should agree about the future parenting of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill addresses a number of these issues, but again I say that it does not necessarily go far enough. Changing terminologies and introducing parenting plans and parenting orders, all with the best interests of the child in mind, is good but it is not enough. The bill is not a panacea for the difficulties of the family law in Australia; however, it does go some way in charting a new direction, and we desperately need a renewed system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the first thing that needs to be said is that considerable resources go towards our attempts to redress the effects of the breakdown of marriage, yet little is spent on counselling services at the beginning of the process. Many members have today spoken on that matter; I think it is almost paramount. Perhaps what is even worse is that less money is spent by government on the enrichment and support of marriage, whereas we can find all sorts of minority groups in the community to whom we can direct special and targeted resources. As a short preamble to my contribution, I make an appeal this afternoon for organisations like Centrecare, Anglican Family Care and, of course, similar bodies in the other churches, and community organisations which provide an immense yet often unrecognised contribution in family support matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share with the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) a sadness that so much emphasis is given to alternative lifestyles and so little to the traditional family. Notwithstanding this unfortunate trend, we have to accept that separation, divorce and break-up of families become sad facts of life. It is in that spirit that I would like to make a small contribution to the debate on the Family Law Reform Bill [No. 2]. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate office, matters of access and custody, along with the associated area of child support, would rank with social security as the greatest single items of constituent concern. It is a sad commentary on our so-called enlightened society that one-third of all marriages end in divorce and that 60 per cent of those divorces involve children. In 1993, almost 50,000 children under the age of 18 years were involved with divorce. The fact that there were 15,000 custody and guardianship applications processed in 1992-93 and nearly another 15,000 access applications indicates the depth of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend aspects of this bill which go to the heart of dispute resolution. I have seen so many horrific cases of separated parents indulging in a totally self-destructive process of custody and access orders and property settlements. What is even worse is that the process becomes so bitter and vindictive that the ability of the former parents to rebuild their own lives is itself destroyed. As one associate of mine has said, the situation becomes a benefit for the lawyers and a desert for the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So often we hear of cases of the breadwinner arriving home at night to find the family home totally denuded, the spouse and the children gone. Often the spouse who leaves the matrimonial home is advised to be as inaccessible as possible for as long as possible. Sadly, there are lawyers around who give that sort of advice. The premise for this is that, if you can keep yourself hidden away for a while, you will establish some sort of de facto recognition of the fact that you are the best custodian of the children. Eventually, the departing spouse is found and the totally corrosive tit for tat contest ensues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several speakers in this debate today have said that the children of these broken marriages are little more than goods and chattels, and indeed they are. Possessions&mdash;not love, affection, certainty and stability&mdash;have become all important in these contests. I have even seen cases which, to my horror, have involved one spouse, through some totally Machiavellian advice, being advised to accuse the other partner of sexual abuse of the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a leading citizen of Bundaberg in tears in my office&mdash;a man with a completely unblemished record, totally convulsed in tears and absolutely devastated by the fact that, as a final vindictive act of separation, his former wife accused him of the sexual abuse of his children. She did this quite callously with a view to making his life as hard as possible while he was trying to rebuild it and have reasonable access to his children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are dealing with this matter, I look forward longingly to the completion of the report on the Child Support Agency and to new mechanisms to see whether some of the abuses and injustices in that system can be ironed out. As I have said, custody and access and the Child Support Agency are often inexorably connected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call to mind one particular constituent of mine, Mr Curnuck, who has been to see me on a number of occasions. His case is one of the saddest and most unfortunate I have known. I preface my remarks by saying that I am not just taking the side of the father or male participant in this debate; I am just taking a couple of examples at random to illustrate the sorts of things that go on. Mr Curnuck lived in Queensland, as did his wife, but she left and went to New South Wales. The custody and access hearings eventually came to court in Sydney. He had so little in the way of resources, his children having been snatched from his home, that he had to hitchhike to Sydney, often travelling by semitrailer, to appear in court. Despite the fact that his former wife got legal aid and that his children were represented in court, he received no legal aid and had to represent himself. This eventually destroyed his business&mdash;as a plant operator he had to be fairly mobile&mdash;and he virtually had to give up everything to contest this case. In addition to that, he again tried for legal aid, unsuccessfully, on the premise that he had little chance to win the case. I thought that the ruling was quite unjust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually, Mr Curnuck was reduced to living in a rented home in a small country town near Bundaberg and, although at the beginning of this dreadful process he had been able to care for his children, he was not in a position to mount a case for their continued care. His former wife, who by then had engaged in a new de facto relationship, obtained custody of the children, all bar one, and left him to a fairly lonely existence. He was also unable to obtain justice before the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new bill has some pleasing features about it. I for one applaud the fact that it will facilitate the greater use of mediation, counselling and arbitration. I applaud the provision of mechanisms for community based counselling and mediation by organisations. I commend the expansion of opportunity for organisations to be recognised by the Family Law Act and the extent of the immunity that will be given to people who provide these services. I also feel that the mechanisms taking the adversarial nature out of the contest may prove to be a godsend in many of these cases. There has been some debate in the parliament today as to whether the change of terminology will do that job. There is at least some anecdotal evidence from the British experience that that might be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find one thing a little strange&mdash;I do not wish to intrude upon bipartisanship with this comment&mdash;that is, the government, the great promoter of international conventions, has not taken into account how badly Australia stands up under the United Nations Convention on the Rights the Child. I for one do not think such a measure should be necessary for Australians. But, given that we are a signatory to that convention, perhaps we should look at how well we perform under that code of conduct. Three of four key areas&mdash;that children have the right of contact on a regular basis with their parents and other people significant to their care and welfare; that parents share the duties and responsibility concerning care, welfare and the development of their children; and that parents should agree on the future parenting of their children&mdash;have not been featured in totality in our existing laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are countless cases where there is no right of contact and where, because of the frailty of the court system, parents do not share the duties and responsibility concerning the care, welfare and development of their children. There are other cases where parents have not been given the opportunity to agree on the future parenting of their children. To that extent, I think the bill has a lot to offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go over territory that has been canvassed quite adequately by both sides of the House other than to say that, in the cases I have cited to you today, had those mechanisms been in place&mdash;had a parenting agreement been required, had parents had to share the responsibility concerning the care and welfare of their children and had the right of contact been available on a regular basis&mdash;and enshrined in the previous acts of this parliament, perhaps we would not be where we are today. So, in a limited sense, I feel that this legislation goes some way to correcting anomalies that exist throughout the whole family law system and that we might see emerging from it a better lifestyle for the children and the parents in these broken relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would in particular like to commend one speaker in this debate. The honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) and I probably do not share much in common politically, but his views on these issues coincide almost exactly with mine. I think the costs of lawyers, property settlements, custody and access procedures and quality of justice are key issues that we should be looking for in all these activities. The rectification of the Child Support Agency and the enshrinement of a non-adversarial form of activity in decisions regarding divorce, parenting and the former access and custody matters should be paramount. I hope that, as further bills ensue from this matter, as the government has signalled, we will be able to attain a better regime for use by those young Australians who make up the third of all Australian marriages which break down and the 60 per cent of children who, up until now, have had an horrific and unstable lifestyle. </PARA>

This measure has been needed for some considerable time. It follows from an idea that former senator Lionel Murphy introduced into this place. One thing I agree about with so many people in former senator Lionel Murphy's fan club is that Australia was never the same place after he had been in the Senate and moved the sorts of laws that he moved. What he did was facilitate people walking out of the marriage relationship upon a whim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very rare cases&mdash;I have not encountered them&mdash;where both parties are happy for the marriage to drift apart. One party is usually left heartbroken, with his or her entire life shattered and ruined. People teeter on the brink. I think it is very seldom that one of the partners does not contemplate suicide in marriage breakdowns. That is the extent of the devastation which is wrought upon one party, while the other party waltzes off into a fairly happy sort of situation. It is grossly unfair that the laws of the country facilitate this sort of behaviour. That they dramatically protect and facilitate the party that walks out of the marriage is deplorable in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of young people say to me, `Our marriage broke down.' I have a standard reply to them. `Yes, mine does too&mdash;about five times every day.' How ridiculous!

Today, at the slightest whim, people walk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose everyone has seen the children who are the victims of a broken marriage. I derive great pleasure every Sunday out of watching my son play football. As a kid, I very much appreciated the rare occasions on which my father was able to watch me play sport. I think there would be very few children anywhere in the world who do not appreciate their father taking them to the football, going shooting as we used to do in our youth, although that is probably not available these days in Australia, or doing whatever it is that makes things enjoyable: surfing, boating, going bush together&mdash;any of those things. If children are deprived of the love of a mother or of the presence of a father, I think they suffer greatly. There is no way that society can make up for the loss of one of those partners. This place should be condemned for the fact that it facilitated the breakdown of marriage in Australia and made it easy for people to do the wrong thing instead of helping people who want to do the right thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think a lot of people read this week of the horrific case in the United States where a young mother murdered both of her children. It was interesting to read the history of that young woman. She had come from a broken home, and the father had come from a broken home. She had enormous stress upon her. Quite frankly, she could not pay her bills. She had a broken romance. Her own husband took no interest whatsoever in her. Her stress levels caused a collapse. Every day in Australia, in one way or another, people are failing to cope. Who can blame them for failing to cope with the stress levels placed upon them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my first actions as a member of parliament was to get in touch with a young lady at a late night diner who asked to speak to me. She understood that I was in politics. She said to me, `I have gone hungry regularly.' I asked why. She said, `Because my husband walked out on me. He went on the dole rather than pay any maintenance, and in any event he took off and I couldn't find him. But I have had to raise our little daughter myself from the age of six.' She gets paid something like $15,000 a year, and it costs her $100-odd for a place to rent in Tully, which is the town she comes from. That leaves her with under $200. People need a car to get to work&mdash;that is, if they can get a job. If they cannot, they just have to exist on that money.

Juvenile violence is a dreadful problem. I attended a public meeting which I called on the weekend, and people kept standing up saying, `The parents should be made to take responsibility for their children.' This was rather an intriguing proposition to put up because society has now made it illegal&mdash;in Queensland anyway&mdash;for parents to chastise their children in any way. Firstly, if parents physically chastise their children, they are liable to have the children taken off them. I will return to that theme in a moment. The only other way that parents can apply discipline is to apply some judicial mental pressure. Children in the state of Queensland have been approached by social workers and told that they can simply walk out the door and be looked after by the state if parents apply judicial mental pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), mentioned a case in a town in Queensland where, after a social worker visited the children at a school and told them that they could walk out if they were unhappy or were being oppressed at home, 15 of them&mdash;a significant proportion of the entire senior school&mdash;walked out. The social worker set up 12 of them in free accommodation with unemployment benefit or some similar benefit flowing to them. Not unnaturally, these people who owed responsibility to no-one for anything became little monsters who rambled around the town bashing people up. When someone interfered with their bashing activities&mdash;a father of five&mdash;they hit him with a steel bar and stove his head in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, whilst they should be punished, I think the social worker and the legislators who were responsible for the creation of this society should also be punished.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a case in Charters Towers where a person had been up on seven convictions and had been away twice to the reformatory. He said that he really liked going away because the circumstances were a hell of a lot better than those at home. Subsequently, far from seeing it as a punishment, he said publicly to the journalist of a newspaper that that was his position. I knew the fellow. He was not a bad young lad.

Two weeks later he was caught thieving again. The police took him home again and the father gave him another hiding. It was not much of a hiding, because the social worker turned up and took the child to the doctor and the doctor could not find a single mark on the child.

We heard a lot of churches condemning this behaviour when we were in government in Queensland.

She was not the one who had been stealing; that was her brother. But they were good, outgoing, well-behaved kids, who said `Thank you', `Please' and called you `Mr'. They were good kids.

We had a problem some years ago where wives were abandoned, the husbands would pay them nothing and they found it very difficult to stay alive and to make ends meet. I have dealt with many of those cases over the years in my office. They were heartbreaking cases. The government moved to fix the problem&mdash;and that was a good thing. But, instead of swinging the pendulum back to centre point, the pendulum has now swung out widely in the other direction.

That brings the total household income to $77,000 a year. She is sitting on the coast with the kids, with a husband and a household income of $77,000 a year, while poor old Kerry is out there at Mount Isa trying to stay alive on $124 a week.

But, until Mr Bolton's kids turn 20 or whatever the age is&mdash;I am not too sure what it is&mdash;and he no longer has to pay this amount of money, he will live in grinding poverty.

This bill, dealing as it does specifically with issues relating to children affected by the breakdown of marriages and with mediation, is a very important piece of legislation in the overall scheme of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, I will deal with a number of the matters raised by particular members. I will deal first with the issue of mediation and so-called alternative dispute resolution, which in this piece of legislation is referred to as `primary dispute resolution'. We are seeking in this bill&mdash;I think it is important to understand this&mdash;to move away from the traditional way in which matters have been dealt with under family law legislation in this country. We want to move towards a situation where the parties own the process far more, towards a situation where it is not simply a case of the parties being processed through a court proceeding or, as some people have described it, a litigation model. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want to move towards a situation where people see that it is in their interests&mdash;financially, socially and otherwise&mdash;to try, with assistance from professional mediators, to reach satisfactory accommodations so that they are not put in the position of having to go to court, with the attendant costs and stresses of that, and finally have a judge make determinations on particular matters when those determinations may not satisfy either party. Frequently that happens. We hear people say, `We went to court and nobody was satisfied with the outcome.' We want to try to empower people so they are better able to resolve their disputes themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the suggestion made by a couple of members that some of this so-called alternative dispute resolution, mediation and the like should be compulsory flies in the face of the whole notion of mediation. The parties must come together with a degree of goodwill towards the process. I think compulsory mediation is a contradiction in terms. Certainly, that is the belief of the government and a number of the key players in this area. Although the government gave careful consideration to this, we have rejected the notion that in any way mediation be forced upon parties to divorce proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that and having pointed out to the House how central we see the changes in relation to mediation as being, I deal with the suggestion raised by the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) that it should be put into the bill that consent orders be subject to the best interests of the child test. The Family Law Reform Bill, tabled on 30 June 1994, contained a requirement that consent orders be subject to the best interests test. The provision has been the subject of much comment during our consultations with the Family Court, the Family Law Council and the family law section of the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In brief, the history of the matter is as follows. As I mentioned, the draft of 30 June contained the requirement that consent orders be subject to the best interests test. However, the best interests test was removed after representations by the Family Court and the Family Law Council as imposition of the test was not consistent with the purpose and practice of the making of consent orders. Critical comments were then made by some judges at the sixth National Family Law Conference in Adelaide in October and there was a call for consent orders to be subject to the best interests test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the Law Council was that consent orders should be subject to the best interests test and that there was a need to ensure that the arrangements made by the parties always be scrutinised by the court. Following that, advice was received from the Family Law Council on 8 November that the current drafting was, in its view, correct and that the Law Council of Australia misconceived the purpose of consent orders. There are, as one can see from this, many differing views and it is proposed that the Family Law Council's advice be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments in favour of the current bill are, I think, very strong indeed. Family law is essentially a private dispute between the parties. The purpose of consent orders is to allow the parties to reach an agreement without going through the expense of litigation. Parents are usually in the best position to know what is in a child's best interests and concern about duress being used to arrive at a consent order can be allayed by one of the following. Once made, at least, a consent order is just like any other order of the court and the enforcement provisions apply. If there is concern about the welfare of the child, further application can be made to vary the parenting order, or application can be made under the welfare jurisdiction of the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parenting plans are also not subject to the best interests test on being registered, but the court is given power to vary provisions relating to the welfare of the child if it considers that it is in the child's best interests&mdash;see proposed section 63E(2). Finally, the role of the Family Court is not to investigate each and every matter but to be satisfied that proper arrangements have been made for the child's welfare&mdash;see section 55A, for example. This is not an application of the best interests test but simply evidence that proper arrangements have been made. This requirement does not apply to de facto couples, but the Family Court has its ex parte powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that introducing this test would fly in the face of what the government is trying to do through mediation. We want to see the parties owning the process, mediation agreements being reached between the parties and the registration of those agreements in the court. Obviously, if it were the case that the court would frequently, of its own motion or otherwise, seek to overturn agreements reached in mediation, then the whole purpose of the legislation in trying to reduce the cost to many parties of family law actions would be defeated. The government is not at all enthusiastic about the suggestion that these orders be subject to the best interests of the child test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some suggestion that this bill would go to a Senate committee. That no doubt will be a matter for determination in another place. But this part of the package of reforms to the Family Law Act was, as were the other parts of the package, the subject of wide-ranging consultations from about 1991 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is critical that we introduce this legislation at the earliest possible time. The reforms contain important changes in respect of not only children's matters and mediation but also family violence initiatives relating to inconsistent orders which were agreed to at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General on 20 July 1994. It is certainly the government's hope to introduce this legislation at the earliest possible time. Given that the matter has been subjected to consideration by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act, I would have thought that every opportunity for airing views on this matter had been provided and that the matter ought to proceed to debate and finality in the Senate at the earliest possible time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by again thanking all of those members of parliament who contributed to the debate. I thought this debate was dealt with in an appropriate manner, given the serious nature of the subject matter. I believe that we have in this piece of legislation a far-sighted and visionary set of laws which will ensure that the original vision for the Family Law Act, as set out by Lionel Murphy, will be taken a stage further. </PARA>

<PARA>This bill provides the basis for a more competitive mail system in Australia. It also sets the ground for continued improvements in Australia Post's services to customers by providing greater flexibility for offering customers choice of price and service quality options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key objective of the government's micro-economic reform strategy is the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services by its business enterprises. The bill takes these objectives forward by:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.reaffirming the government's social objectives to make a letter service available to all Australians at a uniform postage rate. This service is to continue to be provided by Australia Post;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.providing greater opportunities for private mail operators to develop value-added services and niche markets in express mail, time sensitive and higher value bulk business markets;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.furthering the commercialisation and corporatisation of Australia Post;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.providing for the prescription of performance standards in relation to Australia Post's mail services; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.reaffirming that Australia Post will remain in public ownership to operate a national postal network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before outlining the detail of the legislation, it is useful to look at the reforms from a broader perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's reforms recognise the importance of the uniform postage rate as the principle that allows for universal access to a postal service. This objective is shared by all countries, regardless of their different regulatory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, Australia Post has successfully changed from a public service entity with a poor industrial record to an efficient, profitable enterprise that operates at the forefront of world's best practice and delivery service. As a result, Australia Post enjoys strong community support, particularly in rural areas, which rely heavily on the post as a community service. The benefits achieved so far are evident not only to the government, but also to Australia Post workers and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time to build on this solid base, while setting in place some changes to the regulatory framework to provide a continuing competitive discipline to ensure that services are provided efficiently and economically to Australian businesses and households. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's 1992 review of the mail, courier and parcel industries found that entry barriers to the market were low and that vigorous competition already existed in the courier and parcel markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to this direct competition, new technology options for telecommunications and electronic data interchange provide significant indirect competition to the written message market. With these substitute services developing, the current restrictions on competition based on the physical size, weight and the means of carrying a mail message are unduly limiting businesses that wish to access a range of communication networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further reform is now needed to recognise these changes. The bill amends the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 which provides the base for Australia Post's operations. Australia Post will remain in full public ownership, but will face competition in some new areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the domestic market, some greater competition will be permitted in the letter market:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Competitors will be able to carry letters that are charged at four times the standard letter rate. This is a reduction from ten times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Competitors will also be able to carry letters weighing more than 250 grams. This is a reduction from a 500 gram weight limit. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes are expected to open up greater opportunities for consumers and service providers in the large letter and express mail markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of document exchange networks will be recognised in the legislation, by allowing the movement of documents within an exchange service. The collection and delivery of letters from a member's address to the document exchange service centre will continue to be subject to the exceptions to the reserved service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The carriage of letters by a third party from one location to another location of the same organisation will also be permitted. This will give businesses greater flexibility to determine the best and cheapest arrangements for their mail deliveries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments will clarify the position of newspapers, magazines, books, catalogues and leaflets which are directed to a particular person or address. These amendments ensure that newspapers, magazines, books, catalogues and leaflets are exceptions to Australia Post's reserved letter service, irrespective of whether they are directed to a particular person or address, and whether or not they are enclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intention of the amendment is to ensure that the exception in relation to these items applies even if the definition of a `letter' or `standard postal article' in section 3 of the act also applies to the article. However, it is intended to ensure the reserved status of a generic letter under the act. By generic, I mean a mass-produced letter which has an identical message, an identical or unique salutation, and is addressed to a particular person or address. I table a series of examples of generic letters to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also intended that bundles&mdash;for example, packages or parcels&mdash;of catalogues or leaflets with a letter attached to, or included in, one of the catalogues or leaflets in the bundle, or as a part of the bundle, remain reserved to Australia Post unless another exemption in section 30 of the act applies. These changes to Australia Post's reserved services will be achieved by amending section 30 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also establishes new arrangements for bulk mail interconnection. Letters that are lodged in bulk at specified mail centres that are equipped to accept bulk mail will receive discounts based on the transport costs avoided by Australia Post where an operator has undertaken part of the carriage. Discounts for interconnection will be subject to independent scrutiny by the Prices Surveillance Authority as part of the authority's review of standard letter prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of a dispute between Australia Post and a bulk mailer on the interconnection discount, the Trade Practices Commission will have a role in investigating the dispute and providing advice to the minister on the rate reduction. Regulations will provide a power for the minister to direct Australia Post, if he or she thinks fit, to act in accordance with the Trade Practices Commission recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to international mail, the government's intention is that charges are set commercially to reflect the costs of delivery.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, charges for mail exchanged between countries are set under treaty arrangements by the Universal Postal Union&mdash;a United Nations agency of which Australia is a member country. Rates are based on world average costs and bear little relation to the actual costs of delivery in Australia. The arrangements have meant that Australian postal users have been subsidising the users of higher cost countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will allow Australian companies to capitalise on growing international mail competition. The new arrangements are structured in such a way to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the government continues to meet its treaty obligations to provide universal access for letters; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.that private international mail operators are treated on the same basis as domestic customers, once mail enters Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the following changes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Outgoing international letters will be deregulated. This means that consumers will be able to use any service provider to transport mail for delivery outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Incoming international letters will be deregulated subject to a requirement that only Universal Postal Union member countries are able to lodge with Australia Post's network at treaty rates and other international operators interconnect on the same basis as domestic operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.To ensure that Australia Post is not unfairly disadvantaged by the requirement to meet the government's treaty obligations, the bill provides that Australia Post may return incoming international mail that tries to bypass the domestic delivery network or take advantage of low-cost treaty rates. I will be asking Australia Post to establish internal policy guidelines governing the exercise of these treaty provisions and to report to government on its compliance with these policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits of competition are balanced by the government's ongoing commitment to provide for its community service obligations to make a standard letter service reasonably available to all Australians at a uniform charge, wherever they reside. Community service obligations will continue to be funded by a cross-subsidy on the letter service. This is an efficient and equitable approach that shares the cost of providing the service among all postal users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that all Australians have a say in what they want from a postal service. Australia Post's service to rural and remote communities will be subject to a parliamentary review conducted once during the life of each parliament. I will be asking the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to complete the review by 1996-97. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to work with the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post is also to be made more accountable for its discharge of these obligations through an amendment that will require Australia Post to report at least annually on how it complies with its community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of its community service obligations, Australia Post is required to ensure that performance standards for its letter service reasonably meet the needs of the Australian community. To reinforce the importance of Australia Post's community service obligations, the bill allows for regulations to be made setting out performance standards in relation to Australia Post's letter service. The standards may cover such things as mail deliveries, availability and accessibility of mailing boxes and availability of postal outlets. The regulations will not be made, however, until the HORSCOTCI review into Australia Post's community service obligations is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for Australia Post's performance against the standards to be measured and reported on by the Auditor-General and for Australia Post to prepare a service improvement plan for tabling in parliament if standards have not been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the reforms deliver benefits to consumers in choice of price, services and quality, the government has established a number of competitive safeguards that include the following:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.remedies against any infringement of Australia Post's remaining reserved services will continue to be provided through the Federal Court;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.other operators will be able to take remedial action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 against any misuse of market power by Australia Post or other operators;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.Australia Post will be required to publish annually aggregated financial data on reserved and non-reserved services, to demonstrate that there is no unfair cross-subsidisation of services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.price restraint for the standard letter will be formalised by amendments allowing the minister to consider movements in the consumer price index as one of the relevant matters, when considering whether to disallow price increases for standard letters;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the Prices Surveillance Authority will continue to monitor Australia Post's service prices on those areas of the letter market that are open to competition until price competition is achieved in any particular segment. Australia Post will need to establish a case that it is no longer dominant in a particular market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of these changes will be monitored closely and a further review of the remaining restrictions on competition will be undertaken in 1996-97. The terms of reference for the 1996-97 review will be consistent with the government's determinations on the findings of the national competition policy review, the Hilmer report. This approach reflects the government's view that a public monopoly must justify the continuation of its monopoly position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to these competitive reforms, the government is also introducing changes to further refine accountability and reporting provisions already in the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes were announced by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) last year. These amendments are best seen as running adjustments to the accountability relationship between the government, as the shareholder and owner, and Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ministerial powers of direction that are exercised in relation to community service obligations, financial targets and dividends will be amended to require the direction to be laid before both houses of parliament within 15 sitting days. This amendment provides greater transparency for ministerial powers of direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As reflects the commercial relationship between a shareholder and board, an amendment will require the minister to consult with the chairman on the appointment of directors to the board. An amendment will also clarify the board's power to recommend an interim dividend, which reflects general commercial practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secrecy of mail provisions has been revised substantially. Regulations dealing with the opening and examination of mail by authorised Australia Post employees have been brought into the act. This honours a commitment by the former Minister for Land Transport to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prohibitions on disclosure have been expanded to cover a broad range of postal information. A new provision will make it an offence for an unauthorised disclosure of postal information. It will also be an offence to use or further disclose information if the purpose of the disclosure is different from the original purpose for which it was disclosed. A penalty of two years imprisonment will apply for a breach of these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also sets out the limited range of circumstances where access to postal information may be disclosed for law enforcement and national security purposes by Australia Post employees and former employees. Access to the actual contents of mail is not permitted under this act, except to enable Australia Post to fulfil its obligations to deliver mail and comply with Commonwealth, state or territory warrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill sets out the circumstances where an Australia Post employee may open or examine mail. For example, these purposes include repairing mail, to obtain sufficient information to deliver the mail, or to destroy dangerous articles to protect public safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post will also be required to report annually on the number of enquiries it receives from agencies seeking access to postal information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other amendments reflect changes to Australia Post's operations, recognising that Australia Post has been made subject to state and territory laws. Other changes update references to the Companies Act 1989 to refer to Corporations Law and clarify the board's power to set terms and conditions covering the retail sale of postage stamps by post office agents and licensees. The latter amendment is needed to support the uniform pricing policy for standard letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequential amendments are proposed to part VIIA of the Crimes Act 1914 postal offence provisions to prescribe the carriage of certain dangerous goods. These changes are needed for public safety requirements to bring Australia Post into line with international aviation security standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers and businesses have received substantial benefits from government reforms in telecommunications, aviation and the waterfront. This bill extends the industry reform process in the postal sector, and sets the framework for further improvements to customer service, choice and service quality while safeguarding the basic letter service. I commend the bill to the Committee and the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to speak on this Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill, having opened two or three post shops, as they are known now, in my electorate over the last few weeks. I am reminded of the historical role that Australia Post has played in our history, even to the point where the state manager was advising me that the expertise of Australia Post is now sought overseas. I am sure most members would share with me the experience that whenever a post office is under threat of closure members are sure to get a number of phone calls about the concern. Therefore, the role that Australia Post plays in all of our lives is very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill implements the government's response to the Industry Commission's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the efficiency of mail, courier and parcel services industries</EMPHASIS>. It lowers the price and weight of Australia Post reserved services protection. It also opens up incoming and outgoing international mail to greater competition and provides for more flexible interconnection arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires the minister to take CPI movements into account when considering a proposed change in the rate of a standard postal article. It tightens Australia Post reporting obligations by requiring ministerial directions which vary financial targets, dividends or community service obligations to be tabled in both houses. Australia Post will also be required to publish in its annual report disaggregated financial information in relation to its reserved and non-reserved services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also sets out the circumstances in which Australia Post employees, former employees and other persons may open or examine mail. Finally, it specifies circumstances in which postal information may be disclosed, making it an offence to use or disclose postal information for other purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill removes references to registered publications from the principal act. Australia Post will cease its registered publications service from 1 January 1995. The definition of `office' has been extended to include agents and licensees who have been given the responsibilities of post offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill removes from the definition of reserved services the carriage of letters between Australia and places outside Australia. Australia Post will continue to have the exclusive right to carry letters within Australia, irrespective of the origin of the letter. The amount that an international mail service provider pays Australia Post will generally be the amount set out in a convention with the sender country. If no convention exists, normal domestic charges, terms and conditions will apply. A new section will authorise Australia Post to exercise Australia's treaty rights under international convention to return mail to foreign postal authorities. That is, Australia Post may return incoming mail which tries to bypass the domestic delivery network or take advantage of low-cost treaty rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes the deregulation of international mail services, but notes that it is only a partial deregulation. Australia Post will retain its monopoly over domestic carriage of international mail. Deregulation is subject to the proviso that only countries which are members of the Universal Postal Union, a United Nations agency of which Australia is a member country, are able to lodge with Australia Post network at treaty rates. Other international operators must interconnect with Australia Post on the same basis as domestic operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of changes are made to the exceptions which currently exist to reserved services in the principal act. The most important is the exception of the carriage of letters within Australia for a charge or fee which is set at a minimum of four times the rate for a standard postal article. At present the fee is 10 times the standard article rate, or a minimum of $4.50. The bill also lowers the weight limit of a standard article from 500 grams to 250 grams. Below this limit Australia Post has a monopoly on the provision of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's report on mail, courier and parcel services released in October 1992 recommended a progressive reduction in Australia Post's monopoly on ordinary mail. Specifically, it recommended that the weight limit be reduced from 500 grams to 250 grams and that the reserved service rate be reduced to $1.20 from 24 January 1994&mdash;it is now November 1994&mdash;and thereafter progressively reduced at a rate of 10c a year for five years to 70c with a full review in 1997 of how the system will operate after the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas experience has shown that the gap between the standard letter rate and the reserved service threshold must be quite narrow before any effective competition eventuates. New Zealand Post indicated to the Industry Commission that its margin of 35c&mdash;less than twice its current standard letter rate of 45c&mdash;provided adequate protection of its core letter service from potential competitors. Australia Post indicated that its preferred threshold is five times the standard letter rate, and the government's response to the Industry Commission report, as evidenced by this bill, is close to this position. There is no provision for the phased reduction of the reserved service threshold as recommended by the Industry Commission. It is unlikely that the setting of the threshold at four times the standard rate will result in any significant increase in competition for the benefit of consumers. The coalition calls for greater urgency in the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current blanket exception for catalogues and leaflets is to be removed and replaced by an exception for unenclosed catalogues or leaflets; enclosed catalogues or leaflets addressed to a particular person or address; and catalogues or leaflets enclosed in a transparent cover and directed to a particular person or address. These provisions mean that catalogues or leaflets not enclosed in a transparent cover and addressed to a particular person or address will be reserved for carriage by Australia Post. Concerns have been expressed that catalogues or leaflets enclosed in opaque or paper wrappers and addressed to a consumer will become reserved services. It is claimed that this amendment will widen the reserved services monopoly held by Australia Post by preventing its competitors from engaging in activities currently allowed under the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also concern that the inclusion of subscription notices with an otherwise exempt publication may render the package a service which is reserved to Australia Post. Such amendments may have a significant adverse effect on the business companies which currently carry such packages. Amendments were moved in the Senate by the coalition and by the Democrats to maintain the status quo. The government's proposed removal of the blanket exception for catalogues and leaflets would have unduly restricted current practices. Senator Ferguson pointed out in the Senate that the coalition was `seeking to ensure the maintenance of existing provisions and practices that still enable Australia Post to make a very reasonable profit.' The amendments put forward by the Democrats were agreed to by the coalition and by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to contracting out and document exchanges. The exception provisions in the bill will allow organisations to contract out the carriage of letters between offices of the same organisation. An exception will be inserted to allow the movement of documents as part of a document exchange service. However, documents could no longer be carried from one document exchange service to another, nor could they be delivered directly to the addresses of the individual members, even though this practice has been widespread for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ausdoc, a major national document exchange service, has expressed concerns that the provisions applying to document exchange and internal mail will reduce its ability to provide its current level of service. It is concerned that it will no longer be able to provide a courier service between its clients' offices and its document exchange service centres. Ausdoc is also concerned that the strict definition of the word `organisation' contained in the bill will prevent it from continuing to offer government and private business a courier service which is competitive with Australia Post. Ausdoc is further concerned that the requirement in the bill that it charge for every item contained in a satchel, according to the reserved services conditions, will prevent it from providing a competitive bulk mail courier service. In all three cases, Ausdoc contends that the bill will restrict it from continuing to provide the service which it currently provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will move an amendment relating to the service centres of document exchanges&mdash;that is, amendment No. 2. This amendment seeks to allow document exchanges to continue to provide to members an end-to-end service by providing an exception to reserve services for the carriage of letters to or from a service centre of a document exchange. The opposition regards this as important to maintaining the status quo&mdash;and that is all it is, the provision of an existing service for those who use document exchanges. The proposed prohibition by the government would only serve as another impediment to efficient business practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns have also been raised over the definition of the word `organisation' in the bill. The Victorian government is currently investigating whether the definition of the word `organisation' will prevent it from using non-Australia Post carriers for interdepartmental mail. Once again, the amendment which I shall be moving on behalf of the coalition&mdash;amendment No. 3&mdash;is to ensure that current practices are not limited. The definition of the word `organisation' contained in this bill is excessively narrow and will mean that many businesses and community groups will not be covered by the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to extend the definition of the word `organisation' in the bill to include related bodies corporate, within the meaning of the Corporations Act 1989, bodies with a common board of management, or those which carry on business or conduct operations under the same or substantially the same group name. As it stands, the bill does not treat a company and its subsidiaries as related bodies, and treats government departments as separate entities which may not, as a result of this clause, have a private contractor carrying their mail from office to office. Without the amendment proposed by the coalition, if the legislation is passed as drafted, letters carried between offices of an organisation may not be carried in that way. That may impose an extreme penalty on some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move onto the bulk interconnection service. The minimum terms and conditions for Australia Post's new bulk interconnection service will allow mail service providers, other than Australia Post, to transport bulk mail for final delivery by Australia Post. Australia Post must designate the mail centre where such articles must be lodged, and provide a reduction in its charge for the final delivery of the article, including a component based on Australia Post's estimate of the average transport costs per letter avoided because other mail service providers have used the bulk interconnection service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows Australia Post to negotiate with a customer the agreed terms and conditions for the supply of a bulk interconnection service. Regulations will be made to enable the Trade Practices Commission to inquire into disputes about rate reductions, and make a recommendation to the minister who can direct Australia Post to act in accordance with the commission's recommendation. Private mail operators will be able to interconnect with the Australia Post system at designated mail centres and obtain a discount from Australia Post based on the transport costs per letter Australia Post has not incurred because it has not been required to carry the letter for the whole of its journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During July, Australia Post indicated that it would offer discounts of between 1c for standard letters and 14c for 250 gram letters per item on bulk mail which is lodged in the state in which it is to be delivered. It is questionable whether these discounts will entice private operators to take advantage of the interconnection provisions contained in the bill. The Major Mail Users of Australia have expressed disappointment with the interconnection rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rates put forward by Australia Post must be approved by the Prices Surveillance Authority which, it is believed, is concerned that the discounts will apply only if the bulk mail has been transported interstate by the private mail operator, rather than applying to both interstate and intrastate mail. The coalition is concerned that the discount does apply to intrastate mail as well as interstate mail. The bill, as it stands, makes no distinction between the two, but the coalition will move, as amendment No. 4, that the rate reduction apply to intrastate mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the carriage of dangerous goods, a new part is inserted into the principal act entitled `Dealing with articles and their contents'. This requires Australia Post employees and others not to disclose postal information. Unauthorised use or disclosure of information or documents, unless made in good faith, is prohibited conduct incurring a penalty of imprisonment for up to two years. Other provisions cover the opening and examining of mail and the carriage of dangerous foods. These are not contentious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to other matters, a new section is inserted into the principal act preventing postage stamps from being sold at less than the usual retail price to ensure that Australia Post can meet its community service obligations to provide its letter services at a uniform rate of postage. The coalition will move to oppose this clause. It has been claimed by Australia Post that some postal agents and licensees have been selling stamps to customers at discounted prices. The agents have asserted that Australia Post itself effectively discounts by allowing bulk mail and advertising discounts. Even though special conditions apply to these discounts, the fact remains that they are available only to Australia Post post offices, and not to post office agents or licensees. Australia Post has a special advantage in being able to offer discounts which post office agents and licensees are not allowed to offer. Such a position cannot be supported by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both Australia Post and post office agents have said that the issue of selling discounted stamps is not a large problem. The provision in this bill allows Australia Post to take out a Federal Court injunction if there is evidence of discounting. Such a step would seem to be rather excessive. The coalition does not believe that bulk mail and advertising discounts should extend only to post offices run by Australia Post, and there would seem to be little evidence to suggest that such draconian measures are warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another provision of concern to the coalition is that which provides that the managing director will be appointed by the board, not by the minister, but that the minister may terminate the appointment of any member of the board. Such a degree of control is ludicrous. The minister will effectively have the power to intimidate the board. This sets a dangerous precedent which should not be tolerated, and the coalition will move amendment No. 6 to omit the offending sections of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter which the Industry Commission referred to in its report, but which was not dealt with by the government, is the issue of postal services in rural and remote areas. The Industry Commission recommended that, where roadside delivery is made only once a week, this be increased to twice a week. The coalition has long held the view that roadside deliveries should be made at least twice a week. In our regional communications policy at the last election, we made a commitment to increase the maximum once-weekly service to rural and regional Australians to a minimum twice-weekly service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the government's rhetoric, in particular the hollow boast contained in the 1994 edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Rural Book</EMPHASIS> that every effort was being made to provide at least two services per week to those in rural areas, including those in the most remote areas, this is not happening. The government's neglect of rural and remote Australia is typical of its reaction to the Industry Commission's recommendations in relation to this sector. It totally ignored them. As Senator Alston pointed out in the Senate, the government has made it abundantly clear that it is not particularly interested. The coalition is interested. Accordingly, amendment No. 1 will be moved to enshrine a minimum of two roadside deliveries a week for those households to which a roadside delivery service is available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government recommends the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill to the Main Committee and urges the Committee to reject the amendments that have been foreshadowed by the opposition. I will have something to say about those matters later. This piece of legislation will bring Australia Post into the 21st century. It will put it in a position where it will be able to compete with other modes of delivery of information. It will also ensure that there is competition which will keep Australia Post up to a measure of micro-economic reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government's 1988 government business enterprise reforms, Australia Post's performance has improved significantly. This legislation will improve it even more. Australia Post's performance has improved, not only in relation to financial affairs but also on price, service, quality and productivity. The pre-tax profit of Australia Post has increased by 540 per cent, from $46 million in 1988-89 to $249 million in 1992-93. A stronger result is expected for 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Annual returns for Australia Post, including income tax to the Commonwealth, have increased from $4.6 million in 1988-89 to $162.7 million in 1992-93. Australia Post has provided for a dividend of $62 million to the Commonwealth for 1992-93. A $200 million capital repayment from Australia Post to the Commonwealth was made on 31 March 1994, and Australia Post is expected to make further capital payments of at least $100 million in the next two financial years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1975, the price of the standard letter has been maintained at an average of two per cent below the consumer price index and no price increase is expected before 1997. That is a very significant result over 20 years. Labour productivity increased by 5.1 per cent in 1992-93, which was a record, and 92 per cent of envelope mail was delivered on time in the last financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are good results for a public corporation which has been put under considerable stress by informal competition. As has been mentioned by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin), one of those areas is document exchanges which, if they have been operating in the way suggested by the member for Grey&mdash;delivering from one place to another letters that were lighter than 500 grams or cost less than the required amount&mdash;they may have been breaching the law. I will return to the topic of document exchanges later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Communication Workers Union and Australia Post have negotiated an innovative enterprise agreement which will deliver further productivity improvements over the next two years. The union is to be commended for the work that it has done in ensuring that the changes that have occurred in this industry have occurred with the agreement and support of the work force. The agreement that Australia Post entered into with the union is a model agreement that other enterprises are copying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the further reforms in this bill will provide a framework for continued improvement in performance, while allowing Australia Post to meet the government's expectations in respect of its community service obligation. The bill implements a package of postal industry reforms and further enterprise reforms for Australia Post that was agreed to by the government in November of last year. These reforms build on the government's strategy of the micro-economic reform of key industries, continue the commercialisation process of Australia Post, and work towards changes that were recommended by the Hilmer report. The package continues the impetus for further improvement in service to customers, and offers greater flexibility in choice of price and service quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia of the 1990s is well served by Australia Post and the workers in the postal industry. By any measure&mdash;comparison with its peers, improvement on the past or absolute measures of efficiency and productivity&mdash;Australia Post is a very successful undertaking, and the government intends to ensure that it continues in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the government's reforms, the board and management of Australia Post have stabilised prices, improved services, eliminated unfair pricing in loss-making operations and sustained necessary levels of community service to rural and remote Australia. I might just say that some of the worries that the coalition seems to have about the service to rural areas being, all of a sudden, dramatically reduced are really a little bit of scaremongering. Australia Post has had a long history of providing an excellent service to people in rural and remote Australia, and will continue to do that. The government has a view that these services are ones that must be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might mean that, in some ways, there are changes in the way that deliveries are made. I think that people ought to consider that there are changes occurring in the cities, as well as in rural Australia. Australia Post has to be an organisation that can look to the future. In looking to the future, Australia Post has to look at different delivery modes. In the cities, that has often meant that post offices have closed and postal agencies, or Australia Post shops, have opened. Rather than having very large buildings, Australia Post has got down to smaller buildings in shopping centres. It has got down to having agencies in shopping centres, rather than post offices, which were often a long way away from where people went to do their business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that people in rural areas are now getting a delivery every second day. I think my colleague on the other side would agree that he probably spends more time in his electorate office ringing people up than writing people letters. Nowadays, people deal with their urgent business through those newfangled inventions called the telephone and the fax machine. Letters are things that are not as time conscious as they used to be, but we have to ensure that a service is provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the arrangements that Australia Post is talking about here, that service will be provided. The alternative is that we overload Australia Post with costs, to the extent that the price of letters or packages goes up so much that poor farmers or other low-income people cannot afford them. We will then see, because the price has gone up, people reduced to having less mail because they cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have looked for here is the sensible middle road and while people in the cities in the past would have said that they would like to have two mail deliveries a day, they have got on all right with only one mail delivery a day and people have made other arrangements for their urgent business. We ought to be looking to what we are going to be doing in the 21st century, not back to what we were doing in the 18th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the Australia Post board and its management are responding to those things and that is what we have got in this bill. All this has been done while maintaining a fair and ethical commercial approach that recognises a need for profitability and shareholder returns, alongside a need for a customer and community service as an integral element of the accounting framework. At the same time, private sector competitors to Australia Post have provided valuable and valid competing and complementary services that have benefited customers in their own right as well as keeping Australia Post on its toes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention here the question of document exchanges, which was raised by the honourable member for Grey. He seemed to think that one of the real problems with this legislation was that it was unclear what could happen to document exchanges, and he mentioned the question of Ausdoc in particular. One of the things that should be understood is that if people are delivering letters now, then that is illegal. If Ausdoc has set up a business that is delivering letters from one person to another and charging them for it, and the letters do not weigh more than half a kilogram and they do not cost 10 times whatever the cost of a letter is, that is illegal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition is proposing an amendment that would allow some people who are already breaking the law to get some sort of redress by changing the law to suit them, then it ought to think about that again. But the government is willing to go halfway with these document services so that they provide the service that they are supposed to be providing, which is bulk movement of things within individual document exchanges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government gave specific consideration to the role of document exchanges and decided that the movement of documents within document exchange services would be exempted from Australia Post reserved services. The amendment to section 30 of the act will permit documents to be moved between members of the document exchange service from one location or another within the exchange business itself, but not between different exchange networks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not going to allow people to set up another Australia Post. We are keeping the letter service within the parameters that are described in this legislation as a reserved service for Australia Post. Greater liberalisation would effectively enable those document exchanges to become other post offices and&mdash;we make no bones about it&mdash;we are not doing that. We are not doing that because that will put at risk the principle of universal access at a uniform price and it will put pressure on Australia Post's ability to maintain its community service obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my colleague on the other side cannot say it is terrible that we might be reducing services in the country and at the same time agree with his city based Liberal colleagues who want to see Ausdoc and other companies like that rip into Australia Post's base business. The opposition has to understand that while oppositions can propose all sorts of things, sometimes there has got to be an element of consistency. It cannot have one and not the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the government's proposals go halfway and will ensure that Australia Post does become a competitive organisation. The amendments that the government has proposed are divided into two parts. Firstly, there are the postal industry amendments, which include Australia Post's obligation, the reserved service and the powers and operations. Secondly, the amendments refine the accountability and reporting arrangements, which we have not got at present, to include a tightening of the circumstances where postal information may be disclosed to law enforcement organisations and national security instruments. My colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence (Mr Bevis) went into that at some length before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to take account of here is that the government is saying, `These reforms are necessary and we want to have an open process here. We have put this piece of legislation to the parliament, we have got the agreement of the union and the Australia Post board to the changes and they seem to have been reasonably well accepted in the community. But we have also said that we want to see this reviewed in 1997.' So these things are not set in concrete; they are the way we go, we think, but we are going to have a review in 1997 based on Hilmer principles. That is the same approach that we have adopted in the telecommunications industry and we think that is a sensible thing to do. But we are not resting there. The government has also said that Australia Post will have to come up with performance standards and that those standards will be monitored by the Auditor-General. That is something that we have not had in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, the government has said that in the life of each parliament it would like the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure to do a review. That gives members on all sides in this House a chance to have some input on behalf of their constituents. We are quite happy for a free and open assessment to be done on this because we believe that these reforms will be ones that will allow Australia Post to continue into the 21st century as a viable commercial organisation. Competition will keep it on its toes and the reserved business will give it a base by which it can provide a community service standard right across Australia, and that, we think, is one of the most important jobs that Australia Post has to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention at the end the issue that the member for Grey raised about how it was somehow terrible that the minister might have some power of direction of the Australia Post board and that the government might have some say in its obligations. I suppose it is rather peculiar that the people who own the show should actually have some say in what happens in the show. I would hate to think that the directors of Elders or of BHP were told by their shareholders what they had to do, and I am sure my colleagues on the other side would not think that was all that bad an idea. Maybe we would not have had John Elliott getting away with some of the things that it is alleged he was doing if the shareholders had had a little bit more say in what happened there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is a shareholder in Australia Post, and that is what people should remember. The government is the shareholder, the minister holds the share, and because the government is the shareholder the government should have some say in the way the organisation works, because you can bet your life if it blows up you are not going to say, `That is all right, the minister had nothing to do with that.' The first thing you will be doing in the House is getting into the minister for communications and asking, `Why did you let this happen?', and if he ever stood up and said, `Look, it is the Australia Post board,' you would say, `Oh yes, but you appointed all the members and you can't hide behind the fact that the Governor-General did it, because you wrote him a letter saying who he should appoint.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have appreciated the contribution of the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay). His experience of a career with Australia Post ought to be recognised. The opposition's concerns about rural mail delivery are not scaremongering; they are very real. Changes in delivery to rural people have already occurred under current regulatory reform, and I am particularly concerned that the amendments proposed and what we are debating here today will continue the momentum towards the demise of mail delivery in rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People out there depend on their mail delivery for their education, for the conduct of their business and for the delivery of their goods in order to conduct that business. Today I have brought with me letters from constituents in my area, north-west Victoria, where dramatic changes to mail delivery have already occurred. So it is not fair to make the allegation of scaremongering; it is already happening. The opposition's foreshadowed amendment is desperately flagging the need for the government to attend to the needs of rural people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the recommendations of the Industry Commission itself in regard to roadside delivery was that it be available twice a week. The honourable member for Watson has referred to people in the city who have been asked to experience reform and change. That is true, but a delivery of mail once a week is certainly a much lower standard than a delivery once a day, particularly when the education needs of children, the conduct of business and the delivery of goods are dependent upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that political debate on the deregulation of Australia Post has not centred on whether Australia Post's exclusive right to carry letters should be totally removed. It seems to be generally accepted on both sides of politics that some degree of monopoly must be retained in the carriage of letters. However, in line with the recommendations of Hilmer, the exposure of statutory organisations of government to competition is recognised as a very healthy thing. Certainly, the people of rural Australia also recognise that fact because they also pay taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So my plea today is to the minister. I noted in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), that the government is committed to Australians having a say about their postal services, and that Australia Post services to rural and remote communities will be the subject of a parliamentary review conducted once during the life of each parliament. It has already been foreshadowed that that will occur through 1996 with completion by 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to urge today that the government and the members opposite give consideration to conducting that review, particularly in relation to its aspects of rural mail delivery, much earlier. Certainly it should be done next year, because there are changes occurring out there. As I have said, it is not scaremongering at all, it is real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Watson made reference to the way I conduct my office. Whilst it is true that I do make a number of telephone calls, many of those calls have been in relation to this very issue, and in relation to negotiations with the regional managers of Australia Post, who have been implementing substantial reform. I have had post offices close in the absence of a tenderer for a licence. As a result of that activity one of the largest shires in Victoria, the shire of Wimmera, can no longer boast a single post office. That is actually happening, and I would like to see those concerns addressed by the parliament a lot earlier than 1996-97. I would plead the case that the parliament give consideration to the actual impacts that these reforms are having. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural people do not want to ride on the back of other Australians. They are a fairly determined and resilient group of people out there: I think they have to be, to try to make a living out in those remote areas. But even though Victoria has a much denser population than other states in Australia, the reality is that in my electorate of Mallee, which embraces the two strong regions of the Wimmera and the Mallee&mdash;an area of 67,000 square kilometres&mdash;there are only 130,000 people. That is a density of about two people per square kilometre. In that sense, certainly compared with other parts of Victoria, it is a rurally remote area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is certainly very important to those people, and they take very seriously the removal of government services from their small towns. In a small town with a population of less than a few hundred people, a post office provides employment for one family&mdash;usually a family with children. If they are not there, that can then flow on and impact upon the school and so on. The repercussions are substantial, so I ask that the members opposite please give some consideration to people out there who are determined to make their contribution to the nation's wealth and who deserve some better consideration in terms of their mail delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, as we proceed along the roads of development and advances in technology, the way we are going to conduct our businesses is going to change. That is true. But it seems that every time these advances occur, rural Australians have to wait and miss out on a service that is available to the people who dwell along the coastal fringes. This applies to telecommunications. A sophisticated information highway process may well replace the delivery of what we have been used to as communication in letter form over the last 100 years, but this is not in place in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday I introduced a private member's bill to the parliament to ensure that in their community service obligations the Telecom providers are required to address new technology. There is a certain amount of despair amongst the people in my electorate. Whilst they see their postal services eroding in quality, they do not see any alternatives being put in place. Being very brief this morning, I urge government members to advance to a much earlier time the aspect of the inquiry specifically in respect to rural areas; because, as I said, those concerns out there are very real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a huge number of constituents correspond with me on the matter. I will simply make reference to one constituent, Mr K. Cain. Mr Cain has a small enterprise atop the Grampian Mountains and he has had to suffer having his mail delivery reduced to one day per week, through a contract service organised through the Horsham post office. I have had some success in having his mail delivery suit him much better; it is not a formal process, however, but relies on private arrangements between him and an Australia Post contractor. It is an example in my electorate that the subject of part of the amendment that is being moved here today, that roadside delivery service be available at least twice a week, is an important issue. Mr Cain relies on that delivery for supplies to his kiosk. In the busy tourist season&mdash;in fact, at any time of the year&mdash;the Grampians area is an attractive place to visit. He relies on that delivery being one hour's drive from the main regional business centre in Horsham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reinforcing that plea. I want to know why rural people have to wait so long to have their needs addressed and urge a much earlier consideration of the rural service delivery than 1996. I thank honourable members in the government for their consideration on that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In dealing with the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 I would like first to make some references to the amendment which the opposition appears to have considered to be the most important amendment, the one about which it is most concerned, and the matter which has just been addressed by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest). That is the question of whether or not roadside mail deliveries, for which there is currently one service a week, should attract two services a week in terms of the recommendation which was made by the Industry Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that anyone in the parliament, whether from the National Party, the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or, for that matter, the Democrats or the Greens, or even the independent senator, would oppose the proposition that, as far as humanly and practically possible, services which are available to people in the more thickly settled urban areas, the metropolitan cities, the provincial cities, the rural centres, should be extended to those people who live in remote Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise in connection with that, however, the question of practicality. I know that that recommendation was made by the Industry Commission. But Australia Post at the present time has, and always has had, the right to determine itself which deliveries would be made on the basis of one a week. Even if we were to include that requirement in the legislation it would not mean anything and could not mean anything, because Australia Post in the first place would decide which of those centres of mail delivery were once a week services in order to be increased to two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some more observations later about the general performance of Australia Post. I was very privileged, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, to have ministerial responsibility for Australia Post during a period when quite substantial changes were made in its whole operation, particularly in the retail area. I remember the very useful and constructive negotiations which I was able to conduct then on behalf of the government with the union. I notice the union is represented by my former colleague, John Saunderson, in the gallery today&mdash;a person who we would hope will soon return, whether in the same constituency or another, and make another outstanding contribution to the conduct of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were able to pursue quite a number of very valuable and very useful negotiations. We were able to introduce very substantial changes without any industrial dispute at all. I know that more recently the Communication Workers Union, quite understandably, has drawn attention to a lot of the reservations which it still holds in connection with those changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the issue of increasing once a week deliveries to twice a week. I have already given one reason why it is not practical. I was surprised that the opposition actually divided on this question, and only on this question, in the Senate. It is not possible, it is not practical and I do not know that it really addresses the substantial base of concern which was expressed by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest)&mdash;that is, the general question about the adequacy of services for people in rural and remote Australia. If the service at centres which currently receive one service a week were to increase to two services a week, I understand that it would cost something like $5 million. Of course, that has to come out of the bottom line of Australia Post. I will make more reference to that later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the concern for the service delivery points&mdash;such as households, farms and properties&mdash;that do not get a guarantee of one service a week? Why has that not been expressed by people who are speaking for rural Australia? Why did not the honourable member for Mallee, his colleagues and those in the Senate draw attention to the enormous scope of Australia and the widely dispersed people living in remote areas, which are incredibly difficult to get to. Apart from Antarctica, Australia is the most sparsely populated continent on this earth. Even if Australia Post wanted to provide one service a week, it would not be able to do so physically. In fact, if we required it to provide one service a week to some of those places in the wet season in northern Australia, we would break the law to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we understand the concern on the part of the honourable member for Mallee and his colleagues about services to remote Australia. We have got to be sensible about it. The people in remote Australia own Australia Post the same as the other 17 million Australians do. That is their investment and they are entitled to expect that it will operate in a practical, efficient, proper and legal way. The proposition advanced, and the natural extension to that proposition, would offend against all of those requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is substantial legislation and I appreciate the fact that it has come before the parliament. Of course, the fact that it is being considered in the Main Committee indicates that the matters are not unduly controversial despite the fact that the opposition chose to divide in the Senate over a particular question. I understand that the opposition may not divide over this matter in the Main Committee. If there were a division, it would have to go back to the main chamber for determination. I hope there is not a division. It is not necessary, now that the legislation has been defeated in the Senate. The opposition did not get it through the Senate and it is not going to get it through in our chamber. We will not waste any time over that.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the question of review, I had ministerial responsibility for Australia Post. Australia Post is a national institution, a national corporation, a people's enterprise of very conscientious management. Australia Post, not only in connection with this area but also in connection with all other areas of its concern, is continually undertaking reviews, as it should and as it must.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no objection to parliament's undertaking any particular review at any time. Fortunately, that is one of the reasons that we exist. Reviews are one of the means whereby people can filter their concerns and expectations through to the parliament and the parliament can respond. Thank heavens we do. There could be a review by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure or whatever particular parliamentary body could best address that question. There is no reason it should not be looked at if it is seen as an issue of adequate priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all members of committees. In fact, I am supposed to be at a committee hearing now. I will guarantee that it is not operating as effectively as it would be, were I there. With the amount of work that we have to do in committees, we do have to determine our priorities, as we are flat out all the time. If there is a committee which can address that question and can fit it into its priorities, then I would have no objection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that the bill does is to respond to and give effect to some of the Industry Commission's recommendations concerning increasing the level of competition in the delivery of postal services in Australia. Two particular provisions have been made in connection with that. The first one concerns price, and involves the protection from competitive postal services being reduced from 10 times the standard letter rate to four times. That is a very substantial reduction. I remember the extent to which we canvassed this issue at great length, covering all of the options that could have been available, not only arising from the Industry Commission's report itself, but also from the continuing consideration which Australia Post has, quite creditably, given to putting competitive pressures on itself, so as to make it respond more effectively to the need for efficiency, and to give it a more transparent capacity to deal with all of those competitors, and potential competitors, out there in the market. This is a very substantial reduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other provision concerns weight. The limit has been reduced from 500 grams to 250 grams. That is a fairly substantial reduction. The government has more than adequately addressed the need for Australia Post to be exposed to competition and to respond to it. It has done that admirably. At least 60 per cent of the services being provided by Australia Post are already being provided in the competitive market. Many people, fortunately in decreasing numbers, think of Australia Post as being some great monolithic public sector monopoly, which is able to rip the people off, as a result of that monopolistic position. Not so. It just is not so. As I said, at least 60 per cent of Australia Post services are out there in the competitive market. Australia Post has performed very well indeed, and is performing even better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I had ministerial responsibility for Australia Post&mdash;I am not claiming credit for this&mdash;Australia Post's annual profit was about $40 million. By the time that my ministerial responsibility ended, it was $170 million. Fortunately, the people who followed me, especially my good friend and colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), have been able to maintain that momentum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in its last annual report, Australia Post states that it is now making an annual profit approaching a quarter of a billion&mdash;I think it was about $240 million. That is the people's asset. That is the people's investment. The people have a right to expect that, as with their own domestic investments, they will get a good return, and Australia Post is making sure that they do. We have got to temper all of our concerns about the way in which Australia Post operates with essential considerations of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a quick reference to the question of those community service obligations. Again, there is a whole range of ways in which they can be financed. One, of course, is from the budget. Australia Post has maintained the practice of cross-subsidisation. We expect those services to be provided, and if they are not profitable then Australia Post uses its profit in other areas in order to cross-subsidise. That is the way it should be. All firms do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is for some reason an expectation that, of all business enterprises in Australia, only public sector enterprises are not going to cross-subsidise. That is an absurd proposition. It is said that the process has got to be transparent and should be taken off the budget, so everyone can know where the subsidies are. If we are not going to have cross-subsidisation within Australia Post, and if we are going to have cost recovery or subsidisation from the budget, what sort of practice would we adopt as far as standard letter charging is concerned? Will there be a distance charge, as we used to have, many years back? Or will we charge on a regional basis because we want to cost recover? Will we charge on a town basis, or&mdash;for God's sake&mdash;will we charge on a street by street basis? What an absolutely absurd proposition. What Australia Post has been doing is, of course, the correct approach, and I would hope that it will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question was raised of the rural and remote communities. There is a guarantee in the provisions, of course, for the government to undertake at least one review during each parliament. That is built into the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said I would take on board a lot of the concerns of the Communication Workers Union, and I am very conscious of the very responsible position which that union has adopted. Its organisers and advisers have always been more than prepared to enter into negotiations and to discuss the issues thoroughly. As a result, some very substantial improvements have been made which have been important to their own constituents, the people whom they directly represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that Australia Post has become one of the most efficient&mdash;if not the pre-eminent&mdash;postal services in the world. A lot of developing countries come to Australia and ask us how to operate postal services. The Commonwealth of Independent States, the old Soviet Union, in restructuring its postal services, is seeking advice from us and looking at our model. This indicates that Australia can be very proud of its postal service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute as well to Maurice Williams, the chairman, and to all the members of the board: to Rae Taylor,  the former managing director, who has now resigned and is chairing the coal inquiry, and to the new managing director, Graeme John, who came up through the system. Graeme John was one of a number of people who were being considered for that position, and as the managing director of Australia Post he is continuing the momentum of those important changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Postal Corporation was established in 1989. It pays all taxes and charges, as does any other private sector corporation; it also pays a dividend to the Commonwealth, and I have indicated what the bottom line has been for Australia Post over recent years. The restructuring of Australia Post generally reflects the government's policy and commitment to efficiency and the government's determination that the owners&mdash;all Australians, in this case&mdash;of public sector assets will get, firstly, the best possible return from them and, secondly, the best possible service from them. The board, the executive, the management and the work force of Australia Post, and the unions which represent the employees, are all of admirable quality. There has been enlightened cooperation from the union leadership and from union members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often understood that Australia Post employs about 30,000 full-time employees. I mentioned the profit increases that have taken place and the price of a standard letter. If the price of a standard letter had kept pace with inflation since the late 1970s when the old Postal Commission was established, it would not be 45c for a standard letter now: it would be about 70c. There has been, in effect, a real reduction in the price of a standard letter. That has been brought about as a result of efficiency gains and the productivity and cooperation of the work force, as I am sure Mr Saunderson would recognise and endorse. </PARA>

<PARA>A competitive, efficient marketplace is something that I and the coalition generally view as an absolutely essential element of any micro-economic reform agenda. I know that effective competition is also something that those many thousands of small and medium-sized businesses in my electorate view as a necessary ingredient for their long-term economic success. In the context of this particular piece of legislation, competition is central to achieving a much improved mailing system which will provide all Australians with the efficiency and service that they deserve. Therefore, as has been said, we support the bill, although we do not really believe that it goes far enough and we will therefore move some amendments which will at least improve some aspects of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much support in the business community and elsewhere for the coalition's view that monopolies must be opened up as much as possible to a more extensive market competition environment. For example, in 1992 the Industry Commission report on mail, courier and parcel services stated that the greatest gains to these services would flow from `substantial changes to the legislative environment in which the services are provided in order to allow greater competition'. The Industry Commission stated that the monopoly afforded to Australia Post through its reserved services protection in effect restricts competition, gives Australia Post substantial market power and actually reduces the community benefits which would otherwise flow from increased competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission proposed that, through changes to Australia Post's core letter service monopoly, customers would have more choice, thereby placing more competitive pressure on Australia Post, and that Australia Post's opportunities to cross-subsidise would be reduced and new avenues for the use of technology and alternative supply methods could be freely explored. There is no question that over recent years Australia Post has made a number of moves in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major contributor to competition policy has been the report by Professor Fred Hilmer, following the Hilmer Independent Committee of Inquiry into National Competition Policy. In simple terms, the Hilmer inquiry was asked to come up with a plan to make Australia more competitive and his brief was to develop a national framework whereby all business enterprises, both government and non-government, would be exposed to greater competition. Importantly, the Hilmer committee also had the agreement of all Australian governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments made in the Hilmer report which are specifically relevant to Australia Post related to regulatory restrictions and included the following views: that restrictions on the customer's ability to choose amongst rival suppliers should be justified by government; that proposals for new restrictive regulations should demonstrate that benefits outweigh the costs in terms of free competition; that existing regulation which imposes restriction on competition should be subject to regular review; and that reviews, when conducted, should be looked at from an economy-wide perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, where Australia Post is concerned, current structures are at odds with the thrust of the Hilmer recommendations. Consumers do not have any choice when it comes to posting a letter and I doubt whether the government can really justify why this is so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House sounds good. For example, it provides lower price and weight limits on Australia Post's reserve services protection, greater competition for ingoing and outgoing international mail and more flexible interconnection arrangements. The bill also requires the minister to bear the CPI in mind when considering a change in the rate of standard postal articles, tightens Australia Post's reporting obligations, sets out circumstances in which Australia Post can open or examine mail and details when postal information may be disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are welcome measures. So why do I feel more than a little sceptical when I hear in the second reading speech the government trumpeting that the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill 1994 is a monument to competition?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should we not believe this to be the case? I disbelieve this rhetoric because, in reality, I believe that the bill in some ways results in a widening of Australia Post's monopoly. Let us take a look at one or two of the examples provided by the government. The second reading speech made by Senator Bolkus states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitors will be able to carry letters that are charged at four times the standard letter rate. This is a reduction from ten times.</PARA>
<PARA>Well, bully for him! In its submission to the Industry Commission inquiry, New Zealand Post indicated that its gap of 35 per cent, less than twice its standard letter rate, gives sufficient room from its potential competitors to allow it to provide a universal letter service. In other words, it was able to maintain its community service obligations whilst maintaining the gap at less than twice the standard letter rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its 1992 report the Industry Commission recommended that Australia Post reserved services rate, below which it has a monopoly of carriage, be reduced to $1.20 in January 1994, and thereafter be reduced progressively by 10c a year for five years to 70c. Had those recommendations been instituted by this government, we would have seen Australia Post in much the same competitive situation as New Zealand Post has been since 1992. Here we are in November 1994 and the enabling legislation has not even been passed by this parliament. Not only that, but when Labor's reform mirage finally comes into effect, the commencing monopoly threshold will be $1.80, four times the standard letter rate, with absolutely no provision for progressive reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For any business which wants to compete with Australia Post this means that it will have to charge at least $1.80 for the carriage of every item of mail, regardless of size, weight or destination. That is hardly an inducement for competition. This is a classic example of where the government is saying one thing&mdash;that it supports competition&mdash;but is doing another, when it has an ideal opportunity to get its act in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area highlighted in the Hilmer report which has direct relevance to Australia Post is the reference to public utility monopoly structures which restrict competition giving rise to a situation whereby the existence of a dominant public utility provider severely curtails competition. Of particular concern is the opportunity for these major public enterprises or utilities, such as Australia Post, to cross-subsidise a potentially competitive area from an area where they currently enjoy a legitimate natural monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post justifies its monopoly largely by claiming that it is taking on an unprofitable community service, and for this it has the privilege of a monopoly which virtually allows it to charge what it likes. I take up the point of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton. Perhaps the government should pay Australia Post for its community service obligation and then throw everything else open to market competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, there are more of these mirage reforms contained in the bill. The introduction of interconnection arrangements is another clearly unsatisfactory area and one which the coalition amendments will address. By interconnection we mean that a discount is allowed when someone other than Australia Post carries mail over a set distance, thereby saving Australia Post costs. In relation to the necessity for the government to ensure interconnection, the Industry Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The conditions of such interconnection must be fair to Australia Post and to the organisation seeking interconnection.</PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission recommended that interconnection with the Australia Post network be allowed under fair terms and conditions at any point between the sender and receiver up to the location of final sort before delivery to receiver. What we see in this legislation are interconnection arrangements which, for some inexplicable reason, relate only to interstate deliveries and the interconnection discount would only apply if the mail is delivered to one of Australia Post's bulk mail centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point has been raised before by the coalition that there seems to be no logical reason why an interconnection discount should apply, for example, between Adelaide and Melbourne but not between Perth and Broome just because there is a state border involved. It seems nonsensical. Therefore, to correct what I believe to be a silly error in the legislation, the coalition has drafted an amendment. We support the interconnection provisions generally in the bill, but our amendment is there to ensure that the interconnection discounts apply to interstate and intrastate mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to other amendments that we are putting forward, postal services in rural remote areas have already been expanded on at length by previous speakers. We want to amend Australia Post community service obligations to make it a requirement to provide a minimum of two roadside delivery services a week to those customers who already receive one delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Issues with regard to contracting out and document exchange need to be addressed. For example, an organisation called Ausdoc, a national document exchange service, is concerned that the provisions applying to document exchanges and internal mail will reduce its ability to continue to provide its current level of service. One of the previous government speakers said that Ausdoc should not have been doing it in the first place, but the reality is that it is there; it is in the marketplace, and if it is a reality it has to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ausdoc is also concerned that it will no longer be able to provide a courier service between its clients' offices and its document exchange service centres. It is also concerned that the strict definition of `organisation' contained in the bill will prevent it from continuing to offer government and private business with a courier service that is competitive with Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it is concerned that the requirement in the bill that it charge for every item contained in the satchel according to the reserved services conditions will prevent it from providing a competitive bulk mail courier service. In all three examples, Ausdoc contends that the bill will restrict it from continuing to provide services that it currently provides. Our amendment is aimed at preserving existing practices at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the carriage of mail, we have an amendment that provides for a more complete definition of the term `organisation' which, if it is left unamended, raises questions regarding the non-Australia Post carriage of mail between offices of the same company which may have subsidiaries, or interdepartmental mail of governments. I believe the Victorian government, in particular, has some concerns on that front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a fourth amendment concerning interconnection relating to that interstate and intrastate mail, as I previously mentioned. The fifth item on our amendment list is an item in clause 16, which we oppose, which relates to the section in the bill which prevents postage rate discounting for anybody other than Australia Post, as mentioned by my colleague the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin). The final amendment relates to the provision in this bill which allows the minister to terminate any director on the board of Australia Post. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, we support the legislation. Generally, we think that it does not go far enough but it is a move in the right direction. We have some amendments, which are not earth-shattering but will improve it in some ways. However, if the so-called reforms we see before us today in this particular piece of legislation are really an example of the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to maximising competition in the Australian economy, I fear that the Australian people will face a very long haul indeed before we become truly internationally competitive. Of course, that is a prerequisite for the restoring of living standards, not only for today's generation but for future generations as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this Australian Postal Corporation Bill as a useful instalment on the introduction of competition policies for postal delivery services in Australia. Despite the scepticism of the opposition, this bill introduces four very important measures consistent with competition policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those is to reduce the scope and scale of Australia Post reserved services by lowering the weight threshold on these items from 500 grams to 250 grams. The second measure is to encourage competition in value added services such as bulk mail, document exchanges, express mail and overseas items. The third measure is to reduce the protection on standard letter rates for Australia Post from the current $4.50, which is 10 times the standard rate, to $1.80, which is four times the standard rate. The fourth measure is to increase the proportion of Australia Post revenue exposed to competition from 40 per cent to 50 per cent. This is a very important initiative, phasing in competition policies for the delivery of postal services in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) mentioned his scepticism about the significance of these measures. That seemed to imply that he would support a faster introduction of competition policy. The Committee and the government need to be aware of the international experience. We can learn from New Zealand, for instance, which reduced its price protection from 10 times to two times the standard rate in one step. This resulted in 600 post office closures over five years. It resulted in a reduction in New Zealand Post's net income from $31 million in 1988-89 to $5.4 million in 1991-92. It resulted in the imposition of an $80 annual fee for rural deliveries. In fact, the New Zealand government announced in June 1993 that the second stage of its postal reforms would not proceed because there was no proven benefit from further change. There is a lesson to be drawn from the New Zealand experience, and it is that phasing in competition policies in a managed fashion is sensible and it best serves the public interest. The opposition would be well served to understand the New Zealand lesson and experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill demonstrates the government's very strong commitment to national competition policies and the directions set out in the Hilmer report. Competition policies are an essential structural reform in Australia. In any system of production and distribution, competition is likely to enhance allocative and technical efficiencies. There is no better catalyst for continuous improvement in an economy with market features than competition for customers and revenue between service providers. Where users are able to choose between alternative suppliers, sellers of overpriced or inferior goods and services are likely to lose markets and profitability. Even the threat of entry by a new supplier can create competitive pressures. The threat of entry in the case of Australia Post, I believe, is a very important inducement to upgrading the quality and the efficiency of the service provided around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach has been the basis of economic reform in Australia since 1983. The dismantling of industry protection has exposed the traded sector to international market competition. The increasingly effective application of trade practices law has introduced competitive disciplines to the non-traded, services sector. The emerging framework for national competition policies will expose other parts of the non-traded sector&mdash;primarily government business enterprises and the professions&mdash;to domestic competition. This reform, and the public consideration of competition policies, should not be about public versus private ownership, but the huge differences in productivity between competitive and monopoly markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February, the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, adopted the principles and approach of the Hilmer report on national competition policy. This represents the biggest bundle of micro reform in Australia in the 1990s. The pet shop galahs are already talking of nothing but Hilmer. The report recognised that, because of economies and distance, natural monopolies may exist in some industries. There may be some natural monopoly features for Australia Post in rural and remote areas. Duplication of these services, along with rail systems, electricity grids and gas pipelines is not economically feasible. The key to lower prices and greater efficiency in these industries is the creation of access for upstream producers and potential downstream competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hilmer recommended an open and transparent system of declared access to essential infrastructure facilities at fair and reasonable prices. Adherence to the principle of competitive neutrality would prevent governments from unfairly subsidising their enterprises in competition with private firms. Provision of third party access rights is an essential reform in all parts of the infrastructure sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of competitive markets, most of the productivity gains of public business enterprises in Australia have been realised as budget dividends for governments rather than price benefits for consumers. Railways are an excellent example of this trend. Between 1990 and 1992, for instance, labour productivity in the State Rail Authority of New South Wales improved by 12.7 per cent, Queensland Rail by 11.5 per cent, the Victorian Public Transport Corporation by 2.9 per cent and Australian National by 16.4 per cent. But the average cost of sending rail freight improved only at the margin. Costs to industry fell by 5.1 per cent in Queensland, 2.5 per cent in Victoria and only 0.6 per cent on the national line. With even more extravagant dividend stripping, the average cost actually increased in New South Wales by 5.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the large dividends and profits enjoyed by Australia Post will be reduced by the introduction of competition. The important thing, though, is that the price benefit goes not to government coffers, but to businesses and consumers, in the delivery of postal services. This is a very important micro-economic and competition reform for Australia. The government is phasing it in: not making the mistake made in New Zealand, but rather introducing a moderate set of reforms in the first instance with a review in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its meeting in Darwin last month COAG agreed in general to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a package of reforms that comprises a regime to provide access to essential facilities such as electricity grids, gas pipelines, airports, rail networks, postal delivery services, communication channels and seaports.</PARA>
<PARA>The federal government is committed to the introduction of effective competition policies for postal delivery services. It has been declared in the COAG communique, and the government is delivering on that commitment. An important instalment is in this legislation, with further instalments and reforms to follow with the reviews in 1996 and 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now prepared a draft competition policy reform bill, which it hopes to introduce to parliament after the next COAG meeting in February 1995. The bill provides a framework for establishing when, and on what terms, access will be provided to essential facilities. If the owner of the facility and applicant for access cannot reach agreement, the matter will be referred to a new national competition council for the application of public interest considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National competition policies will impact on other aspects of the public sector. It is intended to bring all government business enterprises, including Australia Post, under the coverage of the Trade Practices Act and competitive conduct rules. COAG will also have the opportunity in February to finalise national principles for the structural reform of public monopolies. These principles include the separation of industry regulation from the charter of public enterprises; the separation of natural monopoly elements and potentially competitive trading activities, a very important reform in prospect for Australia Post; the establishment of appropriate financial relationships between the owner and operator of the public enterprise, including rates of return, dividends and capital structure; and consideration of the need for community service obligations and the best means of funding and delivering these mandated obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The removal of the shield of the crown and other pro-competitive reforms will inevitably diminish the capacity of government enterprises to cross-subsidise CSOs. Transparency is essential. Transparency is all-important. Transparency, in the medium term, should be delivered to the operation of Australia Post. The set of initiatives in Hilmer is a very important set of reforms. The COAG meeting in February is an historic opportunity for the states and the Commonwealth to reach final agreement about the nationwide implementation of these reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two reforms stand out with regard to Australia Post. The first, as recommended by Hilmer, is to end the cross-subsidisation of Australia Post services. Community service obligations should be used to maintain rural and remote area services at a standard letter rate, but they should be fully transparent. That is, they should be off government budgets. They should not be hidden in the cross-subsidisation practices of Australia Post, but should be fully exposed to the Australian taxpayers and public through budget arrangements for the payment of community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second important reform in the medium term is to continue the phasing down of the standard letter rate protection and the phrasing in of further competition. In this regard, the Industry Commission report in 1992 provided good guidance. I know that members, particularly the member for Wills (Mr Cleary), would be interested in the recommendations of the Industry Commission in 1992. At the very least, the commission recommended a minimum private letter rate of $1.20 and a phase-down over a further five years of 10c each year, bringing the standard rate to 70c and allowing competitors fair access to the Australia Post network. Competition under these arrangements, in the medium and longer term, phased in by a federal government committed to these reforms, is a good thing. It is good for consumers because it provides a diversity of service options. It provides competition in price, delivery, efficiency and basic notions of customer service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition is good for business. It lowers business costs. The unit cost of business comes down and, as a result, we get an expansion in economic growth which satisfies the public interest across the country. In the internationalised Australian economy, competition&mdash;and these continual upgrading processes&mdash;is absolutely essential. If the economy is exposed to international competition in the manufacturing sector and some of the services sector then competition in the rest of the economy, including government business enterprises like Australia Post, is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the threat of competition, as in the case of Australia Post, produces good outcomes. We have seen some of these things in the public sector already. Let us look at the example of telecommunications. Austel has calculated that consumers are paying $300 million less for telecommunications in Australia due to the basic duopoly competition between Telecom and Optus. The cost of peak-rate telephone calls between Sydney and Melbourne fell by 20 per cent between June 1992 and May 1993&mdash;a substantial improvement in price and customer service competition. And that is with a duopoly. Imagine how well the system will run and the sorts of benefits that will flow through to consumers and business from open competition after the next review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the example of airlines. The end of the shameful two-airline agreement, propped up by consecutive coalition governments in this country, and the introduction of competition saw air fares fall by 20 per cent from September 1990 to September 1993. This is a substantial benefit for business and airline consumers in Australia and a considerable attraction, as all the reports show, for the growth of Australian tourism industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission has produced a very interesting document, which I would recommend to all honourable members. It is an information paper produced in May 1994, entitled `Improving the efficiency of GBEs'. This is a collection of all the evidence and reports the commission has had about the impact of competition and micro reforms on GBEs. Its conclusion is very important:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the inefficiencies which have been observed in GBEs are the direct result of lack of competition. For example, in the absence of competition, overinvestment in capital facilities can be supported by higher prices or low rates of return. Likewise, the absence of competition makes possible overmanning and other inefficient work practices which have often been characteristic of public enterprises. Consequently, the internal efficiency of enterprises may suffer and cost structures inflated.</PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion from a decade of Industry Commission research is that competition policies are effective in bringing down prices, improving work practices and improving the efficiency of the Australian economy, out of which we get a net gain in economic growth&mdash;essential in our internationalised circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post is absorbing some of these changes, but there is a lot more work to be done in the medium to longer term. Fifty per cent of the income of Australia Post is still sheltered from competition. Australia Post continues to be the only company entitled to carry letters weighing up to 250 grams for a price of $1.80 or less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested by the response of Australia Post to the Industry Commission report. It was entitled, `The government's decision and how we'll meet the challenge.' Towards the back of the document, the Australia Post managing director, Graeme John, started his overview with the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new rules add up to a challenge which will stretch us&mdash;but not beat us.</PARA>
<PARA>The commitment is there but it is still a little artificial to put these matters in such dramatic terms and conditions. The truth is that, under the arrangements to be confirmed by this legislation, Australia Post has the equivalent of a 300 per cent tariff as it would apply to the manufacturing sector. So I dispute the claim that the challenge will stretch us. The challenge should stretch it but the competition is not too raw and extreme at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had in Australian industry the maintenance, as the honourable member for Wills has often recommended, of a 300 per cent industry tariff, Australian unemployment would be double or possibly treble its current rates. Australia at that level of protection would not be able to force the sort of industry upgrading that is required to produce jobs and growth. These things should be put on as level a playing field as possible to make sure that, if manufacturing industries and service industries in Australia are being exposed to international competition, the introduction of competition for Australia Post is, through the medium term, just as rigorous and just as important in producing of reforms and improvements in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of these competition policies has brought a range of responses across the country, as it has in this parliament. Last week Professor Hilmer invoked a plague on the houses of all governments, outlining his frustration&mdash;which I share&mdash;at the lack of progress in the introduction of his report and a framework for national competition policies. But the blame for this should be slated directly to the state governments. At the last COAG meeting they derailed reforms put in place, as recommended by Hilmer, by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Premier, with an absolutely astounding attachment to the lawyers, tried to freeze out competition in the professions, and to protect the Victorian Bar Association and his lawyer mates in Melbourne. This is an extraordinary argument from someone who touts himself around the national agenda as an advocate of micro reform. It is micro reform for everyone except the Victorian Premier's mates in the legal profession. The states were also united in some erroneous arguments concerning the impact of budgetary competition on their own budgetary situation. The truth is that in a competitive industry environment the profit margin is reduced by virtue of competition. As a result, the clawback into federal government tax revenue is a lot lower than the states have been speculating. That is a point that Professor Hilmer has now confirmed on several occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If competition were to result in the privatisation of state enterprises, the states have argued that they would lose an income stream out of their monopoly rents and profits. The truth is that if they were to privatise, which is the practice and policy of some of the states, the income stream that they are losing would be built into the sale price. It would be factored in&mdash;not at the high rate of a monopoly market, that much is conceded&mdash;but an income stream would be factored in to the sale price, which they could invest in other business enterprises, or on investment markets to realise a return to their state budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that the question of federal compensation has been artificially inflated by the state premiers and their governments, for the purpose of holding back competition reform. We have seen, only yesterday, the resistance of the opposition to aspects of competition reform. In the main chamber, the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was involved in a debate concerning the federal government's reforms for competition between private health insurance companies. The member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) outlined her resistance to competition for doctors and for private health insurance companies. The opposition and its colleagues, such as the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, have a very bad record on competition policies and competition issues. The truth is that competition is good for the country, irrespective of state and federal budget implications. The states should recognise that and they should support the phased introduction of competition policies, as demonstrated in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition policy, and its economic growth implications, is not a zero-sum game. The whole economy benefits from micro  reform, efficiency gains and the sort of growth that we need to compete on international markets. The states, I am pleased to note, have made some progress, isolated as it may be. Recently, the New South Wales government&mdash;after some delay but now to its credit&mdash;has introduced competition between private and public trains on the Hunter Valley coal rail haulage lines. That is, the government has declared the line as an essential facility but, consistent with Hilmer, has set up competition between public and private rail companies. Competition across the board should be accepted by the states, the union movement, the consumers, and the businesses of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to the passage of this legislation and the agenda this government has launched, acting on Hilmer's report. Finally, in the national interest, I also look forward to some cooperation and substantial progress next February at COAG. </PARA>

He pointed out that Australia Post enjoys strong community support and is an extremely efficient organisation. Therefore, why all the talk about competition? In fact, we are told, by one speaker after another, that Australia Post is one of the most efficient organisations in the world. Why is there the need for an amendment bill and why the need for further competition, as per Hilmer and the Industry Commission? After everything that we have heard, why does the member for Watson (Mr McLeay) want to argue that Australia Post needs to be brought into the 21st century? That is absolute rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the Labor Party simply addicted to the notion of competition? Nothing in the speech of the honourable member for Brisbane, apart from a vague and general reference to the role of new technologies in diminishing the activities of Australia Post, is provided to defend the government's decision to open Australia Post to further competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due respect to the honourable member for Brisbane, goals such as economic efficiency and consumer benefit need to be approached with caution. Honourable members on both sides of the House would be aware that such principles formed the very justification for the Kennett government's closure of schools, in both metropolitan Melbourne and rural Victoria. If I recall correctly, there were a number of members of the coalition who were up in arms about these efficiency driven closures. Down in Victoria, of course, there were plenty on the Labor side who condemned the Kennett government when it instituted these policies. Paradoxically, the Labor party in Victoria seems to have had a change of heart. It is now, through its financial management package, as hot to trot on the logic of efficiency as the Liberal Party is, so it has got a problem there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members can claim that these changes are, at worst, innocuous as far as Australia Post's interests are concerned, and, at best, a boon to consumers. But it is easy to see why some in the Communication Workers Union believe it is the thin edge of the wedge. It is all very well for the member for Watson to crow about an enterprise agreement achieved by the Communication Workers Union. He does not advise us, of course, that there are many within the union who are not happy about the changes. What the member for Watson also does not want to talk about is the fact that 4,000 jobs have been lost over the last three years. Is it via job losses that the member for Watson envisages the funding of Australia Post's community service obligations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wakelin) calling for greater urgency in the reform process? One wonders whether he has considered what might happen to heavily subsidised rural electorates if the kind of rabid competition recommended by the Industry Commission is implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Post returns a substantial dividend on its assets. This year it returned an after tax profit of $125 million, if the figures presented to me are correct. This profit subsidises Australia Post's community service obligations to rural Australians. All in all, it is a quality service that is provided. Australia Post admits that about 60 per cent of its market comes from letter delivery. Allowing competitors to carry letters at near the same price as Australia Post does will erode Australia Post's profit and place greater pressure on its ability to meet its community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International mail freight provides Australia Post with substantial profits for its community service obligations. Removing the monopoly that currently exists would allow multinationals to cream off easy profits from the Australian postal industry&mdash;profits that quite rightly belong to the Australian people. Bulk mail interconnection would allow these multinationals, and other private mailing houses, to lodge all bulk mail and addressed junk with any specified delivery or mail centre, at reduced rates of distribution and delivery. Distribution and delivery are the costly sections of the postal industry. Interconnection with the Australia Post infrastructure amounts to unfair competition. It offers a subsidy to the competitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's obsession with competition really needs to be questioned. It is not good enough for the government to simply say it is better than the other mob while, at the same time, claiming to be concerned about fair play, equality and Australian culture, including economic culture. On page 5 of this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, there is an article entitled, `Culture drowned by US sports ads'. This comes in the wake of, and in contradiction of, the Prime Minister's much heralded cultural statement. It is a clear and unequivocal statement about the effects unbridled competition can have on the economic and social interests of a small country. In essence, the article claims that:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not talking here in a jingoistic way about Australian culture either.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the points made by the Prime Minister in his cultural statement.

If that happens and statements are being made about cultural sovereignty, we are in a contradictory position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By analogy, if competition means that Australia Post cannot subsidise rural areas and the people that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) talked about do not have fax machines, will the honourable member for Watson be telling us what a great thing competition is? The irony in all of this, yet again, is that it is only honourable members of the National Party who rise in this House to question the free market and free trade position of the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bipartisan addiction to the principles of competition pose a great threat not only to Australia's economic and social sovereignty but to its so-called commitment to egalitarianism and a fair go.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the protection of Australia Post's reserved services is reduced, where does the money to fund cross-subsidisation of the kind the honourable member for Mallee alluded to come from?

They are the facts from overseas, from Thatcher's England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will respond by telling us that this is all about restructuring&mdash;restructuring in the interests of efficiency. The problem is that a lot of us are getting sick and tired of this kind of restructuring. We are sick and tired of it in my electorate in the northern suburbs because restructuring has meant a loss of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is instructive that hardly one speaker has put forward a comprehensive argument as to why Australia Post should face further competition. The kind of empiricism provided by the honourable member for Werriwa&mdash;and I think the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) might agree with me&mdash;is a particular kind of positivism. It is the point made by the Prime Minister yesterday when he tried to explain that the facts produced to support inequality in Australia were selective. I think the honourable member for Werriwa indulged in the use of selective figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) spoke glowingly about Australia Post before telling us that it should be exposed to competition. However, there was nothing in what he said that logically meant it should be exposed to competition. Why he did not bother to elaborate, I do not know. It is not just about financial return and profit for Australia Post. It is the social role that Australia Post plays that should be paramount in our thinking. The facts are as follows: firstly, over the last year within Australia Post, productivity has risen by 5.1 per cent; secondly, 92 per cent of letters were delivered on time&mdash;in Victoria 93 per cent; and, thirdly, Australia Post paid to the government a total dividend of $62 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 Australia Post produced a profit of $57 million. In 1993 it was $249 million, an increase of 400 per cent over that period of time. In 1993 Australia Post paid $273 million in taxes and charges to federal, state and local governments. Since 1989 approximately $914 million has been paid into government coffers. The government proposes further competition. The opposition demands more competition&mdash;more competition than proposed by the federal government. One wonders why. This is despite the fact that so much of the competition facilitated by the federal government has done no more than erode our economic sovereignty and diminish the social role of our public corporations. We are seeing that at the state level in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the coalition's amendment, in essence it exposes the stupidity of this amendment bill. On the one hand, the government wants to expose Australia Post to competition and the coalition wants to expose Australia Post to more competition. On the other hand, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), in demanding that Australia Post maintains two deliveries to rural and remote areas as part of its community service obligation, puts forward really what is a contradictory position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a joke! When competition fails to deliver the appropriate social outcomes, the very defenders of competition immediately seek government regulation to solve the problem. It was the same story with National Party members and the World Trade Organisation bills. We have had orange juice delivered to us in the parliament recently. Again, that exposes the contradiction between the interests of the rural sector and our obsession with free trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obsession with competition is truly out of hand.

For instance, the post office in Narooma was able to adopt Countrylink. It was able to supply services from a variety of government departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If post offices can supply services from a variety of government departments, they are not only helping the local area, they are also strengthening the business of Australia Post.

Because item numbers are used, confidentiality is built into the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly urge governments at all levels to use Australia Post to a much greater extent and to take advantage of the fact that `post' does not necessarily just mean an item being sent.

I have had a long-time friendship with her. I have also had a letter from Noel Hall, who is Manager of Brentford Square licensed post office, Forest Hill, Victoria. I respond to a couple of points they have made about clause 16 of the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill. I think the opposition members have also responded to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the Post Office Agents Association was rather complimentary about clause 16. In fact, when I was convenor of the land transport and postal services working group of the government policy committee on transport, and when I was chair of the whole committee, post office agents made it very clear that they saw good reason for precluding licensed post offices from discounting stamps. In fact, I can recall the agents coming to see me and bringing examples of advertisements in papers. The licensed post offices were offering quite hefty discounts for stamps and this was, of course, competing not only with Australia Post but also with other licensed post offices. Apparently, in a submission to the Senate select committee, the Post Office Agents Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reviewing section 16 of the bill (proposed new Section 33A) the Association concludes that its purpose is to preclude LPOs from discounting stamps, for it prohibits the sale of stamps at less than retail price. The Association applauds this initiative as it will maintain consistency of approach in the distribution of postage in Australia and hence efficiency of the system.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on in the same submission, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">POAAL does not favour any activities which enable postage products issued or authorised by Australia Post to be sold at less than their usual retail price. Such activities undermine the viability of LPOs and can lead to uncertainty in distribution of postage products.</PARA>
<PARA>However, there was a change. In fact, Mr Hall, whom I mentioned before, called this a draconian power. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It gives Australia Post draconian powers to crush the 7 licensees throughout Australia who are ALLEGED to be discounting stamps. There are 3,000 licensees in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small businesses such as ours have made a massive contribution to the economy and welfare of the nation, risking our hard earned savings in doing so. I find it ludicrous for the government to support the demands of a giant corporation to overcome a minuscule problem.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, my friend Marie McGrath-Kerr, Chairman of the Post Office Agents Association said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The section is also worded so ludicrously that a Post Office Licensee cannot give a stamp to, for example, his mother, without the potential for appearing before the Federal Court! Considering the significant financial investment by licensees in the postal network . . . is it too much to ask that there be a level playing field, i.e. same rules for Corporate Post Offices and Licensed Post Offices.</PARA>
<PARA>She also said</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draconian powers to be given to Australia Post under Section 16 must be of concern to all Members.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly ask the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to take that into account. I am not sure that either the Post Office Agents Association or Australia Post treat postage stamps in the way they should be treated. They seem to me to treat stamps as a good. In both Marie McGrath-Kerr's letter and Australia Post's briefing, it seems to me that stamps are treated as a good that is to be sold. What is a postage stamp?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am inclined to agree with the union, which has talked to me briefly about this, that a postage stamp is a receipt which says, `Here is a receipt for a service that you have already paid for.' It is a receipt entitling a purchaser to a service. I have never heard of receipts being sold at a cut price. We need to take that into account. Australia Post can discount services that are being provided through licensed post offices if it wants to. Australia Post does discount its services, but it does not give people 45c postage stamps at the value of 30c, or something like that. The problem has been that we do not regard a postage stamp as being what it really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the query from Marie McGrath-Kerr whether a post office licensee can give a stamp to his or her mother without the potential for appearing before the Federal Court is&mdash;and this is the answer that I believe Australia Post would give&mdash;that the licensee can pay for the stamp. I was involved in running businesses for 25 years. When I took goods from the business I bought them so that it would be clearly shown just what I and my family had bought. Even if someone took a bottle of shampoo off the shelf, it would have been recorded as having been purchased. There is nothing wrong with licensees purchasing from their business&mdash;say purchasing from the post office a 45c stamp and giving it to the mother of the licensee. In a business which is properly run and uses that strategy, this sort of thing would not happen. </PARA>

When I heard that the Industry Commission was going to be holding public hearings in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney and a couple of other provincial cities, I raised many of my constituents' concerns and, as a result of representation, the Industry Commission came to the western parts of my electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its findings the Industry Commission combines the need to make genuine reforms which would lead to reduction in costs to consumers, and the need to maintain and improve services in rural and remote Australia. The government's response to the Industry Commission report is not in any way as progressive as the Industry Commission report. The government has taken a piecemeal approach. It has adopted some of the recommendations in part, but in other areas, not at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission strongly advocated a reduction in Australia Post's monopoly. That was the overriding recommendation that filtered through the report. It recommended that competitors be allowed to compete for the carriage of letters for a fee of at least $1.20, that this rate be steadily reduced by 10c per year for five years, and that the weight limit for protected services be reduced from 500 grams to 250 grams. It was a progressive reduction, allowing competition to enter the market, and this monopoly area was not going to be king-hit overnight. It was a sensible recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has agreed to the weight reduction but squibbed on enhancing competition. This legislation will only allow competitors to carry letters for a fee four times the rate for a standard postal article. Essentially, competitors will be able to compete only if they charge at least $1.80 to deliver a letter. International experience shows that competition occurs only when the standard postal rate and the competition threshold are close. They have got to be very close together. They are still miles apart, and thus the likelihood of significant price reductions and service improvements is very remote. It is very important that, as price reductions occur, we see an improvement in the services as well, and that service is not sacrificed in the name of price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extremely hypocritical of the government to wimp out of genuine reform. The federal government is demanding that states and local government embrace the recommendations of the Hilmer report, which is all about a national competition policy for this country. Yet when the crunch comes in Canberra the government fails to match rhetoric with action. We have only to look at what the federal government did with ANL when it comes to national competition policy. Here it is telling state governments to start to implement the recommendations or get on with the process of more competition where the monopoly services are provided by state and local government, but it will not match that rhetoric in Canberra when it has the opportunity to do so. </PARA>

Quite clearly it lacks the courage and the fortitude to do it itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch now on some rural services, because what is conspicuous by its absence from this legislation is the recommendation of the IC report relating to rural mail services. The Industry Commission recommended:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mail in rural and remote Australia brings education material to the students who study through the School of Distance Education, it brings medical supplies, it brings food, and most importantly it brings contact with the outside world.

There are many thousands who receive no mail service at all. The industry commissioners recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Government, in consultation with Australia Post, undertake a full and urgent assessment of the need for mail delivery services for those households not presently receiving a roadside delivery service.</PARA>

With one mail service per week, students face a minimum of two weeks for the return of lessons that they do at home under the supervision of a governess or their parents&mdash;or alone, in many cases.

They could not start to understand or appreciate the hardships under which some of these students are gaining access to education. The school is not just down the road. On many occasions it is 400, 500 or 600 kilometres away, and on a dirt road at that. The way their education is delivered is through an HF radio signal from a central point, often 400 or 500 kilometres away.

<PARA>At the time the Industry Commission was investigating this for the report, it was said that facsimile machines are often suggested as an alternative for the delivery of these lessons. Now these are used as far as possible, but are not really suitable for all material.

We support reform and greater competition as a means of generating cost savings for all Australians. Competition, however, will not work in some areas&mdash;in areas of low population in remote locations. They need to be treated separately and provided with assistance openly and transparently. That is what our amendment sought to achieve. We do not intend holding up efficiency goals, when those who are unlikely to gain from such progress can still receive improvements by dealing with their particular circumstances on a separate basis. We will continue to pursue this amendment and we hope that during the debate the government, and the minister particularly, will understand that they ought to put politics aside and look at what they could do for those students by supporting our amendment in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment very briefly on something that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) raised&mdash;the matter of the licensed post office agencies of this nation. I, too, have met with the organisation that represents the licensed post office agencies across this country. I have recently received a letter from the Association of Post Office Business Agents, which is an alternative to the POAAL&mdash;the Post Office Agents Association Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there are still a great many differences between the understanding of the government and of the people who deliver these services through the licensed post office business agents. One of the concerns that the Association of Post Office Business Agents has is that it is not seen or accepted by the government as representing some of the licensed post office agents. It appears that the government only accepts one organisation as the body representing the licensed post office agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to look at the concerns of the Association of Post Office Business Agents, because it certainly has many concerns about some of the issues that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro raised, particularly in the area of discounting. At a recent meeting with me, the association raised the issue of discounting. There is certainly discounting going on out there, but the association indicated to me that it was not necessarily confined to the rural post office agents. Not all of the post office agents are based in the rural areas. Some of the post office agents who suggested that were in the capital cities, where we know there are licensed post office agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister would do well to at least hear out the Association of Post Office Business Agents, and to accept that there is another organisation which represents a particular view point of licensed post office agents. Whilst the association putting the view that is accepted by the government is certainly putting the points of many of the licensed post office agents&mdash;perhaps the majority&mdash;it should be noted that the other association does have a conflict with some of those views. I think it is very important in a democracy not to lock out the opinions of associations that have organised themselves in a voluntary capacity. I trust that the minister will look at the concerns of the Association of Post Office Business Agents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be opposing the bill but I urge the minister, and the parliamentary secretary, to take on board the concerns of our side of the House and let us see whether we cannot improve some of the services to those kids doing their education out in the bush. If honourable members want to know more about this issue, I recommend that they visit the back of my electorate, the back of Grey, the back of Kalgoorlie or parts of the Northern Territory and Aboriginal communities, to see for themselves that there would be benefits from more mail services. I do not think this legislation goes far enough and I am very disappointed that the government is not picking up the opposition's amendment. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS is monitoring developments in electronic dissemination of information, including within the library sector. At this stage, few libraries offer public `hands on' access to remote electronic information sources, due in part to an inability to provide sufficient appropriate public access technology.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The exchange rate mechanism used to convert foreign pension depends on the source of the foreign pension and the purpose of the conversion. The mechanisms used are:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) For pensions received in Pounds Sterling the conversion to Australian dollars for Service Pension assessment purposes is made at a uniform base rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mechanism used to determine an exchange rate for the Pound Sterling has undergone a series of changes designed to make it fairer and more responsive to changes in market rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to May 1990, a `notional' exchange rate applied to Sterling. The rate was set by administrative process and was varied when the trend in the average market rate varied from the notional rate by 5 cents or more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period May 1990 to November 1992 a `base'exchange rate was applied just four times a year. The base rate was determined by averaging the previous 3 months market rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In November 1992 the quarterly mechanism was seen as unresponsive to variations in market rates and was replaced with a mechanism that takes the average of daily market rates over a fortnight and applies that rate for the next possible pension payday.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparison of the market rates and the Department's base rates over the last four years shows that the net effect of the constant rise and fall in the exchange rates has evened out with the recipients neither gaining nor losing as a result of the exercise.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Government employs a number of complementary funding mechanisms to subsidise pathology services provided by public hospital laboratories and private laboratories. Provisions for the payment of Medicare benefits for pathology patient episode initiation (PEI) fees are in keeping with the Government's pathology funding arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding of public hospital pathology services is the joint responsibility of the Commonwealth and States and Territories. The Commonwealth contributes to the costs of these services through the Hospital Funding Grants paid to States and Territories under the Medicare Agreements. These grants enable Medicare hospital patients to receive pathology services at no charge and include a contribution for the equipment, overhead and other infrastructure costs associated with the provision of services in the hospital setting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pathology services provided by private practitioners to private patients, whether in or out-of hospital, are subsidised by the Commonwealth through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The MBS arrangements for pathology provide for the payment of Medicare benefits for a PEI fee, to cover the administrative cost elements associated with a pathology episode, and for individual tests undertaken within the episode. These arrangements recognise that overhead costs are incurred on a patient episode basis rather than on an individual test basis. Public hospitals are not eligible to claim PEI fees for the services they provide to private patients as the Commonwealth has already contributed to these overhead-type costs through the Hospital Funding Grants to States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Medicare benefits arrangements for pathology replaced, in February 1992, the former two tier pathology fee system. Under that system, two schedule fees applied to all pathology tests listed in the MBS. For tests provided by specialist pathologists in private practice, a `Specialist pathology' (SP) fee applied, while for tests provided by other pathology providers, including tests provided to private patients by public hospital laboratories, an `Other pathology' (OP) fee applied. SP rates were set at higher levels than OP rates to take account of the overhead-type costs incurred by private providers and for which public hospitals were reimbursed through the Hospital Funding Grants to States and Territories.</PARA>

Some of these serve a mixture of both metropolitan and rural or regional areas. The large number of regional and rural Assessment Teams reflects the fact that assessment workloads are determined by both the size of the population in the catchment area and the geographic size of the catchment area itself.
