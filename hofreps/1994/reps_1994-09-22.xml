<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both houses recently resolved to adopt new general principles which cover arrangements for the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings on the parliamentary and news network. The adoption of the new general principles follows the recommendations of a report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, which I chair. The committee also indicated in its report that it would adopt new standing determinations which flesh out the details of the radio broadcasting arrangements. These were adopted by the committee yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the new arrangements retain the core principles which have characterised radio broadcasting of parliament since its inception in 1946. However, they incorporate changes to reflect current technical, procedural and community realities. They represent an important reform in this area of parliamentary broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specifically, the major changes which will be noticed by members will be: first, a change to the allocation of the broadcasts&mdash;Mondays and Thursdays will be House of Representatives broadcast days; second, the radio broadcasting of weekend sittings&mdash;members will recall that there was no radio broadcast of the most recent Saturday sitting, last year, during the debate on the Mabo legislation&mdash;third, a greater coverage of proceedings by allowing the transfer of broadcasts from one house to the other and by allowing the broadcast of proceedings after 11.30 p.m. when they occur; and, finally, broadcasting of the adjournment debate. This brings the arrangements for radio broadcasting into line with those for televising.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In accordance with the resolution of both houses, the new arrangements come into effect on 10 October 1994. For the information of members, I table a copy of the new general principles and standing determinations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present the following report: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 331: Advisory report on the Financial Management Accountability Bill 1994, Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and Auditor-General Bill 1994</EMPHASIS>, and on a proposal to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8J4">Mr LES SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to table the 331st report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which is an advisory report on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901&mdash;and, of course, it is a very important advisory report for this parliament. On 29 June 1994, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced a package of three bills into this chamber: the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994. For the sake of brevity, I shall refer to the bills as the FMA Bill, the CAC Bill and the Auditor-General Bill respectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After their first reading in the House, the minister successfully moved that the bills be referred to the JCPA for review, with an advisory report to be presented to the House by 23 August 1994. However, the breadth and detail of evidence presented to the committee forced it to request an extension to the reporting deadline. On 23 August, the House agreed to extend the reporting deadline until today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members will be aware that, on 28 June this year, Senator Robert Ray gave notice of a motion in the Senate to establish a joint standing committee to be known as the Audit Committee of Parliament. On 29 June, the Senate agreed that the proposed resolution for the establishment of an audit committee should be referred to the JCPA for inquiry. The Senate's motion of referral also requested the JCPA to give particular attention to the appropriateness of establishing a separate committee rather than conferring the functions of the proposed committee on the JCPA. The JCPA decided to combine its report on the three bills and the Senate's motion into the one report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say from the outset that the JCPA has welcomed the opportunity to review the bills and consider the Senate's motion. The legislation to replace the Audit Act will form the cornerstone of the Commonwealth's system of financial accountability, and the committee has taken its responsibility very seriously. We also acknowledge the spirit in which this legislation was referred to us by the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consideration of legislation by joint committees represents a new maturity in the way of making legislation. The committee's review has allowed many Commonwealth entities, and organisations outside government, an opportunity to comment on the bills before they become law. The committee received 65 submissions and held six public hearings with witnesses coming from as far afield as South Australia and Tasmania to give evidence. In addition, we spoke to the Controller-General of the United Kingdom, who happened to be visiting Australia at the time. The committee also invited the coalition, the Australian Democrats and all independent members and senators to forward their comments to the committee for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review process has been important and valuable. The committee believes that the constructive and bipartisan approach of all involved in the inquiry has led to recommendations that will enhance the quality of the legislation. Minister Beazley is to be congratulated on referring the legislation to the committee. As I mentioned earlier, we welcomed this opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I detail some of the major recommendations made by the committee, I draw the House's attention to the JCPA's long involvement in moves to have the Audit Act replaced by more modern legislation. The Audit Act has been amended many times since 1901. However, despite the amendments and the flexibility provided through the extensive use of delegated legislation, the basic structure of the act has been unable to accommodate the demands of modern public sector management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first recommendation made by the JCPA in its 1989 report on the Auditor-General entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 296: The Auditor-General: ally of the people and the parliament&mdash;reform of the audit office</EMPHASIS> was that the Audit Act be repealed and replaced with legislation that allowed more effective and flexible financial management. This recommendation was accepted by the government in 1989. Thus the JCPA has welcomed the introduction of these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I shall now focus on the committee's major recommendations on a bill by bill basis. The FMA Bill establishes an appropriate structure for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies, and the committee has made only two minor recommendations for change. Recognition of the need for quality management has underpinned many of the recent public sector reforms. Unfortunately, the current legislative framework for financial management within the Commonwealth has not kept pace with these developments. The FMA Bill proposes to overcome many of the deficiencies in the current Audit Act. The committee is heartened to see the balance that has been struck between the devolution of authority to the chief executives of agencies and the need for a counterbalancing chain of accountability back to the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the CAC Bill. At present, the accountability requirements for Commonwealth authorities and companies are scattered through numerous enabling acts, company memoranda and articles of association. The CAC Bill draws these together in a single set of core reporting and accountability requirements. The committee welcomes the introduction of the CAC Bill, principally because it will enable parliament to view the accountability requirements of the vast range of Commonwealth authorities and companies as a whole. Furthermore, it will ensure that the accountability requirements are explicit and consistent for each class of Commonwealth entity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a number of recommendations have been made to clarify the interpretation of clauses in the bill and make them more consistent with standards set by the Corporations Law. In particular, the committee believes that the obligations and duties of directors of Commonwealth authorities should be consistent with the requirements placed on the directors of private sector companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A matter of concern to a number of witnesses appearing before the committee is the penalty regime established under the CAC Bill for breaches of duty by executive officers of Commonwealth authorities. The committee acknowledges that the penalty regime for executive officers in the CAC Bill should not be so strict as to discourage appropriate people from sitting on the boards of Commonwealth authorities. Nonetheless, the penalty regime should also reflect the higher standard of duty and care that parliament expects of people undertaking public duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee has supported the CAC Bill's penalty regime for executive officers who breach their duties but has recommended that the bill be amended to allow relief from prosecution in cases where there are extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General Bill defines the powers, functions and role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The JCPA welcomes the introduction of the Auditor-General Bill and supports the principles behind the legislation. In particular, the committee welcomes the fact that the Auditor-General has been given an unambiguous mandate to audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities and almost as extensive a mandate to conduct performance audits. The decision to establish the ANAO as a statutory agency is also a positive step. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the committee believes that the bill, as proposed, represents a limitation on the parliament's capacity to make informed assessments about the efficiency with which taxpayers' money is being used by government business enterprises. Clauses 14 and 15 of the bill only allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs at the request of both houses of parliament by resolution or at the request of the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the bill does allow parliament to request a performance audit of a GBE, the committee believes that to require a resolution of both houses is cumbersome, time consuming and potentially impractical. It is important that there be easier mechanisms by which parliament can directly request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the most efficient way of doing this is to delegate the parliament's authority to request a performance audit of a GBE to one of its committees. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow an Audit Committee of Parliament to directly request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE without the need to go through the responsible minister or both houses. The committee expects that this power would be exercised only rarely and after consultation with all parties involved, which would include the responsible minister. This is consistent with the second dot point concerning the duties of an audit committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, the priority for GBE performance audits would be those GBEs furthermost from the discipline of the market. Of course, the responsible minister and both houses of parliament should retain the right to request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow the Auditor-General to negotiate the terms and conditions of staff of the Australian National Audit Office. As it stands, audit office staff continue to be employed under the Public Service Act 1922. This is consistent with one of the recommendations in the 1989 report of the JCPA, report No. 296. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has accepted that the Auditor-General's capacity to undertake his functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. This should make it easier for the Auditor-General to attract and retain the highest quality staff. However, the committee believes that it should be possible to balance the Auditor-General's wish to have the freedom to determine competitive packages for ANAO staff with the requirement to protect their basic terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee has also recommended that the bill should include a proviso that the terms and conditions set by the Auditor-General be consistent with government industrial relations and employment policies and the principles decided by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission from time to time. Furthermore, audit office staff should continue to be employed and appointed under the Public Service Act until such time as any new terms and conditions are agreed with staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Senate's reference of the notice of motion for the establishment of an audit committee to the JCPA for inquiry. The government's interest in establishing an audit committee is particularly welcomed by the committee. The JCPA has long argued the need for an Audit Committee of Parliament and broadly supports the functions envisaged for an audit committee by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notice of motion would create a separate Audit Committee of Parliament, a move proposed by the JCPA in 1989. However, the JCPA now considers that, for reasons of efficiency and effectiveness, the functions of an audit committee could be more appropriately conducted by the JCPA itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has come to this conclusion for several reasons. Firstly, the JCPA has a long history of liaison with the Auditor-General. This has given the JCPA members a strong understanding of the issues affecting the Auditor-General and his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the JCPA has a statutory obligation to examine the reports of the Auditor-General. JCPA members have developed a detailed insight into the Auditor-General's levels of activity and the efficiency with which they are carried out. With this information, the JCPA members are well placed to comment on the Auditor-General's proposed levels of future activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the JCPA already acts informally as a conduit for parliamentarians to indicate aspects of public administration that they would like the Auditor-General to examine. If the audit committee functions were added to its responsibilities, the JCPA would undertake this task on a formal basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not believe it appropriate for Australia to follow the United Kingdom precedent, where the House of Commons audit committee and public accounts committee are separate. The reason for this separation in the UK is that the chairman of its public accounts committee is, by convention, a member of the opposition. A similar separation is not necessary in Australia, given that the chair of the JCPA is always a government member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the JCPA believes that it is highly desirable that an Audit Committee of Parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. The committee believes that statutory recognition can be most appropriately achieved by amending the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951. This act details the membership, duties and functions of the JCPA and should be amended to give the JCPA the additional powers to perform the functions of a parliamentary audit committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA believes it is important that the JCPA's function as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. To clarify the distinction, the JCPA believes that the Public Accounts Committee Act should require the JCPA to convene as the Audit Committee of Parliament when performing audit committee functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that minority parties and Independents should be represented on the audit committee. This is most appropriately achieved by increasing the membership of the JCPA by one and reserving the extra position for a representative of any minority groups or Independents in parliament. The committee believes that these recommendations will give the parliament a strong and efficient audit committee that will strengthen the links between the Auditor-General and the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the review process that has culminated in this report has been valuable and conducted in a constructive spirit. The legislation and the notice of motion to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament combined represent a landmark package aimed at improving the framework of Commonwealth financial administration and strengthening the accountability of the public sector to parliament. I believe the committee's recommendations will further enhance this package and lead to even more accountable and efficient public sector management. I look forward to the government's response to our report and to the upcoming debate on the bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express my personal thanks to all those members and senators on the committee who have given so much of their valuable time to this review. It has been quite an extensive inquiry in the short time we have had and I really do appreciate the efforts that they have all put into their duties as members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the officers of the Department of Finance and the Australian National Audit Office who have assisted the committee, both formally and informally, in the course of the review. The committee also wishes to express its appreciation to all the other individuals and organisations that prepared submissions and appeared as witnesses before the committee at such short notice. The staff of the House of Representatives printing unit should also be thanked for their efforts in getting the report printed for us in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would like to express our appreciation of the work done by all the staff of the committee secretariat during this review. They always work extremely hard and do a tremendous job; they put in a lot of extra work above and beyond the duty that we would normally expect of them. In particular, I thank Laura Gillies, Donna Christophers, Lorraine Partridge, James Catchpole and, of course, our secretary, Grant Harrison. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts, I welcome this opportunity to comment on the 331st report, which is an advisory report on legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901. On the same day that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) introduced a package of three bills&mdash;the Auditor-General Bill 1994, the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994 and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994&mdash;the Senate agreed that the proposed resolution for the establishment of an Audit Committee of Parliament should be referred to the JCPA for review. Report No. 331 combines the committee's review of the bills with the Senate's motion into one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to focus my comments on the Auditor-General Bill and the role of an Audit Committee of Parliament. In particular, I will stress the importance of the role of the Auditor-General and the benefits that parliament can gain from having an effective audit committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General and the audit office are fundamental to parliament's ability to keep government officials and instrumentalities accountable for the efficient and effective expenditure of public moneys. To achieve this, the Auditor-General needs to have the ability and resources to comprehensively report to parliament on the financial management of the Commonwealth. It requires a mechanism to ensure that there are clear channels of communication between the Auditor-General and the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, for the Auditor-General's audits and reports to be accepted as valid, it is essential that the Auditor-General should not be subject or suspected of being subject to pressure from the executive or the legislative arms of government to report in one way or another. For this reason, the Auditor-General also needs statutory recognition of his or her theoretical or practical independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has broadly supported the Auditor-General Bill as it gives the Auditor-General an unambiguous mandate to audit the financial statements of all Commonwealth entities and almost as extensive a mandate to conduct performance audits. It also gives parliament a limited role in the appointment of the Auditor-General and establishes the ANAO as a statutory authority. However, the committee has reservations about several aspects of the Auditor-General Bill. The main concerns focus on the way the bill restricts the Auditor-General's mandate to conduct performance audits of GBEs, makes no provision for the Auditor-General to set terms and conditions of ANAO staff and gives no recognition to the role of an Audit Committee of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the committee's major concerns is that the bill as proposed limits the capacity of the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of government business enterprises. Clauses 14 and 15 of the bill only allow the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of GBEs at the request of both houses of parliament by resolution or at the request of the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is concerned at the effect that this has on parliament's awareness of the operations of GBEs. The committee accepts that generally GBEs should operate at arm's length from government and the parliament, and that a GBE's performance should be judged on its capacity to achieve results in a commercial environment. Nevertheless, the committee believes that parliament has a right to be informed of the activities of all Commonwealth entities, including  GBEs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), has explained, the committee has recommended that, for the sake of efficiency, parliament delegate its power to request the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of a GBE to a parliamentary committee&mdash;namely, the proposed Audit Committee of Parliament. Parliament would retain the right to request a performance audit by way of resolution. In this way, parliament will have a much more effective input into determining whether a GBE should be subject to a performance audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the three bills were tabled in the House on 29 June 1994, the Auditor-General tabled report No. 43 of 1993-94 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliament's right to know: Legislation to replace the Audit Act 1901</EMPHASIS>, which detailed his response to the provisions of the Auditor-General Bill in particular. One of the major recommendations made by the Auditor-General was that the Auditor-General Bill should be amended to provide the audit office with the authority to establish appropriate terms and conditions for the employment of staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Audit office staff are currently employed under the Public Service Act 1922, and this arrangement will continue under the Auditor-General Bill as it currently stands. The chairman also referred to this matter in his remarks. The Auditor-General argues that he needs to be able to set terms and conditions for his staff that are competitive with their private sector equivalents and that would give him or her the flexibility to meet changing requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the Auditor-General is in a unique position in the public sector, given his or her role in strengthening the accountability of the executive to parliament and improving public sector efficiency. To assist him or her to undertake this function, the Auditor-General needs the assistance of the highest quality staff. The committee believes that the Auditor-General's capacity to undertake these functions would be enhanced if he or she had greater flexibility to negotiate competitive remuneration packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the Auditor-General Bill be amended to allow the Auditor-General to determine the terms and conditions of audit office staff. However, the committee is aware of concerns that the terms and conditions of staff would be eroded if staff were no longer employed under the Public Service Act. Accordingly, the committee recommends that the terms and conditions set by the Auditor-General must be consistent with government industrial relations and employment policies and principles decided by the Industrial Relations Commission from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise that the process of establishing the terms and conditions of audit office staff is likely to be a complex and lengthy process involving negotiation between the relevant parties. For this reason, the committee recommends that audit office staff should continue to be employed and appointed under the Public Service Act 1922 until such time as new terms and conditions are agreed with staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation made by the Auditor-General is that former auditors-general should not be able to take up further employment in the public sector. The Auditor-General is concerned that there could be seen to be implications for the independence of the Auditor-General if an Auditor-General is reliant on the executive for future employment when his or her term of appointment is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges that the position of Auditor-General is unique and has a special place within the system of government. However, inclusion of such an amendment to the bill would prevent a former Auditor-General from making a further and valuable contribution to Commonwealth administration. Accordingly, the committee believes that there should not be restrictions on former auditors-general seeking offices of profit under the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is also concerned that parliament is not adequately involved in the process of appointing the Auditor-General. The bill requires auditors-general to be appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the responsible minister. Before this stage, the minister must consult the Minister for Finance, a nominee of the Leader of  the Opposition in the House of Representatives, and the chairman of the JCPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agrees that parliament should have greater involvement in the appointment of the Auditor-General. In the committee's view, it would be preferable if representatives of parliament were given the right to veto a nomination for Auditor-General. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that the appropriate minister must seek the approval of the JCPA, an Audit Committee of Parliament and the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, or his or her nominee, before making a recommendation to the Governor-General. The committee does not believe it is necessary that the finance minister be mentioned in the process, as it can be assumed that the finance minister will be consulted in the normal decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the functions and composition of an audit committee. The honourable member for Oxley has already outlined the additional functions that the JCPA envisages for an audit committee and why the JCPA has recommended that the functions of an audit committee should be conducted by the JCPA itself. I would like to stress three principles about the Audit Committee of Parliament that have arisen from the JCPA's recommendations. Firstly, the JCPA believes that it is highly desirable that an Audit Committee of Parliament have statutory recognition to give the necessary permanence to such an important committee. The JCPA, as has already been discussed, recommends that this be done by way of amendments to the Public Accounts Committee Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the JCPA believes that its function as an audit committee should be clearly distinct from its traditional functions. For this reason, the JCPA has recommended that the JCPA convene as an Audit Committee of Parliament when performing audit committee functions. Thirdly, the committee believes that minority parties and Independents should be represented on the audit committee. This can best be achieved by increasing the JCPA's membership by one and reserving the extra position for a representative of any minority groups or Independents in the parliament. These recommendations will provide parliament with a strong and efficient audit committee that will strengthen links between the Auditor-General and parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the committee believes that parliament needs a strong Auditor-General with adequate powers and resources to carry out his functions. I believe that the committee's recommendations in toto will enhance the quality of the Auditor-General Bill 1994 and strengthen links between the Auditor-General and the parliament. The end result should be a more efficient and accountable public administration. I add my thanks to Grant Harrison and his team on the committee secretariat, who performed their duties admirably in a process that was strictly limited by the amount of time we had to review this report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I am pleased to be speaking on the tabling of this report, which is an advisory report from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As previous speakers have pointed out, it deals with a combination of three bills and the proposal to establish an Audit Committee of Parliament. As the chairman of the JCPA has already given a substantial overview, I will confine my remarks to the Auditor-General Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill seeks to more closely define the powers, functions and role of the Commonwealth Auditor-General. The Auditor-General's functions include auditing the financial statements of all Commonwealth agencies, authorities, companies and relevant subsidiaries. Performance audits are also the responsibility of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this bill, the Audit Act has enabled the Auditor-General to hold office for any length of time subject to retirement at the age of 65. This bill establishes a term of office of up to seven years. This gives flexibility to the government and allows for the appointment of a person for a lesser time should that be the arrangement between the government and the desired appointee. With this flexibility there exists the possibility of suitable candidates from private industry being able to be appointed. The public good is served by mixing the administrative cultures of both the Public Service and private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has spent a considerable time on the question of the appointment of the Auditor-General. The final say is in the hands of the government. But this bill requires that consultation shall be had with the Leader of the Opposition and the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. This consultation process is to be encouraged not only for the position of Auditor-General. Members will be aware that in the United States Congress the appointments to very senior positions, such as Auditor-General, are preceded by public hearings and questioning of the nominee by an appropriate congressional committee. This is a useful method for involving the legislature in the major appointments of the executive. Perhaps members of parliament should give some consideration to looking at the American system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee hearing system for senior appointments is especially correct for the position of Auditor-General, as there has been some discussion on whether or not the Auditor-General should be an officer of the parliament. Some people may see the consultation mechanism of this bill as being inadequate. Even with consultation, the system is very heavily weighted towards the executive. Ultimately, the government could consult with everyone in parliament and end up doing as it wanted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House should remember that the Auditor-General is part of the accountability mechanism which parliament uses to hold the government accountable. With this fact, the House should look carefully at the question of the Auditor-General being an officer of the parliament. In discussion on this matter, it was proposed that one approach could be to allow the parliament or its representatives to veto a nomination for appointment to the position of Auditor-General. It would be possible to confer the right of veto over an appointment by making the instrument of appointment a disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way would be if representatives of the parliament were given the right to veto a nomination for Auditor-General. Examples of this practice can be found in the New South Wales and United Kingdom parliaments, where the chairman of their respective public accounts committees has such a right. Members should be aware that, in the United Kingdom, the chairman of the committee of public accounts is a member of the opposition. This situation, allied with the existence of veto power, results in the appointment of an Auditor-General who enjoys the confidence of both sides of parliament. This is a desirable situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also discussed the question of the Auditor-General's remuneration. This bill will alter the way that the Auditor-General is paid. Currently, the Auditor-General's remuneration is pegged with the second tier of remuneration of departmental secretaries. This bill will now have the Auditor-General's remuneration determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. I suggest that this is not before time. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case can be made that it is necessary that the Auditor-General be paid at the level of those officers who are being audited. The committee's view generally recognised the importance of the office of the Auditor-General and thought it appropriate that this matter be dealt with as a specific case by the Remuneration Tribunal. In dealing with this bill, the House should emphasise the independence of the Auditor-General and take steps to enhance that position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to make a few brief remarks about report No. 331 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is interesting to note that the committee, which is a joint standing committee with representatives from most political parties in the parliament, has been given the opportunity to comment on three very important bills being proposed. Those bills are going to have a profound effect on the way the Commonwealth's operations are run, particularly through its commercial enterprises&mdash;GBEs and the like. The Auditor-General Bill will have an effect on their accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was timely that we were given the opportunity to review the proposed legislation, because one of the sectional committees of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is currently coming to the end of an inquiry into the efficiency and effectiveness of government business enterprises. The report on that inquiry will be presented later this year. The JCPA's report No. 296, which some time ago recommended a number of changes, was probably one of the instigating factors in the three bills being brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is relevant to comment on a few areas of the chairman's foreword in report No. 331. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that the Financial Management and Accountability Bill will establish an appropriate structure for financial management and accountability within Commonwealth agencies and the Committee has made only two recommendations for change.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it would be fair to say that, during the deliberations of the committee, we reduced the number of recommendations we made for change. The foreword goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the underlying principles of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill and believes it is important to establish consistent reporting and accountability requirements for Commonwealth authorities and companies.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a few recommendations in that regard. Most importantly, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also broadly supports many of the provisions in the Auditor-General Bill. However, the Committee has recommended that Parliament be given greater opportunities to request the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits of Government Business Enterprises . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There are also a number of other recommendations. The committee consulted very broadly on these bills with a lot of government business enterprises and government departments. Some people who gave evidence and who gave the committee submissions expressed some concern that there may have been a lack of consultation by the Department of Finance in doing its research before putting the bills together. We highlighted in the report that the responses we got from some government departments were less than satisfactory. Notwithstanding that, generally it has been a very good exercise. It has given members of the opposition the opportunity to have input into the finalisation of legislation before it is debated in the parliament, which we certainly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to highlight a couple of the  recommendations with regard to the Auditor-General and the audit committee. As the parliament would be aware, report No. 296 recommended&mdash;and it has subsequently been recommended in other reports that have been tabled&mdash;that the Auditor-General become an officer of the parliament. I think it is important that the Auditor-General not only be totally independent but also be seen to be totally independent. This issue was debated and discussed at length. Some of the recommendations in report No. 331 do not go that far but certainly move in that direction. I think it is important that we recognise that, regardless of which side of the House we sit on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had numerous discussions with all different sorts of bodies, including public accounts committees from other countries. The recommendation that is pertinent to the Audit Committee of Parliament is recommendation 37, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Public Accounts Committee Act of 1951 should be amended by inclusion of a separate section empowering the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to perform the functions of the Audit Committee of Parliament. The amendment should:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) change the name of the Committee to Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) list the functions to be performed by the JCPA when convening as the Audit Committee of Parliament and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) confer the same powers and privileges to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts when carrying out its audit committee functions as when carrying out its traditional duties.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 39 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 5 of the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 be amended to increase membership of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to 16 members. The Act should state that the extra position is to be reserved for a parliamentarian nominated by any minority groups or independents in the Parliament. If no such person exists, then the position should be filled according to the practice of the Parliament at that time for joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to note that we do receive all the audit reports from the ANAO now for review. The committee is established, and the view of the committee is that we do not believe it would be wise to establish another layer, another committee, above what is there now. The function can be easily fulfilled by the committee that exists. Certainly under the proposal in the current bill we suggest amendments to that clause. The positions that are there would logically be filled by nominations from the opposition and the government, by the members who are already on the public accounts committee now anyway. We urge the government to be cognisant of those facts and of the work the committee has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I pay tribute to the staff of the secretariat, led by Grant Harrison, and the work they have done in getting this together and getting it ready. It is difficult to deal with a bunch of politicians who are spread right across Australia and get a consensus view on things. The secretariat has done an excellent job. We commend the recommendations in report 331 to the government and trust that it will take those on board in its deliberations and hopefully make the necessary amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I endorse generally the comments that have been made by the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), and by other members who have spoken in connection with the tabling of this advisory report on the three draft bills concerned with financial management and audit and on the proposal for an Audit Committee of Parliament. I also endorse generally the sentiments which have been expressed by them in relation to this matter. I want to concentrate my comments more on process rather than content. It was only at the end of June of this year that the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) referred the three draft bills to the public accounts committee. A motion which was in the process of being considered by the Senate concerning the possible appointment of an audit committee was also referred to the committee. The committee chose&mdash;as the chairman indicated&mdash;to deal with the three bills and the Senate motion at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister referred the bills to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for review, he emphasised that the bills were concerned generally with financial management and accountability. That initiative by the Minister for Finance represented a significant development. I believe the Minister Beazley should be commended for deciding to undertake this process. To my knowledge, this is the first exercise of this kind which has been undertaken by a minister, certainly in this House, in referring to a statutory committee of the parliament, consisting of members of all major political parties and of both houses of the parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate, questions of this kind to review draft legislation which has been prepared by the government and, as was indicated in response to us by Dr Michael Keating, the Secretary to the Treasury, items of legislation which had clearly been examined in detail and carefully prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, in his speech referring the bills to the public accounts committee, likened this process to providing an exposure draft. He also said that the matter required `decent handling' by the parliament. In concluding those comments at that time he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chairman of the public accounts committee endorses that comment. That paragraph indicates that the minister was genuine. He referred the bills and in effect said to the committee, `Make your recommendations.' This is a very important initiative as far as the operation of this parliament is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the minister, by that decision, has injected a new process into the procedural continuum by which legislation is prepared, considered and enacted by this parliament. The usual players in that process are: the ministers and their immediate advisers, operating within the context of a general framework of government policy; the bureaucracy, working with the minister and essentially preparing legislation to satisfy his and the government's policy objectives; parliamentary counsel to make sure that the legislation is appropriately constructed and phrased; individuals and groups who are consulted in that process; the government's own policy committees; cabinet; and then, finally, the government's full caucus, which then has the responsibility for giving approval for the legislation to be introduced into this chamber. It is only at that stage that, in the past, the opposition has been given a formal opportunity to become involved in the process. That has been in the past. This represents a very significant departure from that past practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, by this decision, has sought to involve all of the parliament in the process&mdash;both government and opposition, both the House of Representatives and Senate, and all of the major political parties within this institution in what effectively has become a new, pre-debate stage in the preparation and consideration of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that it is only a competent and confident government which could deliberately choose to pursue that course. This government is such a government. This government and the minister by this process are showing respect for this institution of parliament and are giving evidence of a respect for and recognition of the contribution members can make through the structures of the parliament, which in this particular case is the public accounts committee, to the construction of good legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of recommendations&mdash;there are 39 in total, but not all of them are suggesting amendments to the draft legislation&mdash;should not be taken as reflecting unfavourably on the quality of the draft legislation. To my mind, the draft legislation is good, solid legislation. It is progressive, it is innovative and it is responsive to the need for reform in these areas with which it is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three draft bills modernise and consolidate the important elements of government financial management and accountability. That was referred to by the chairman of the committee in his tabling speech when he said that, in effect, they bring together regulations, memoranda, procedural principles and different items of legislation from a whole range of agencies and authorities as well as the core legislation which they will replace. To my mind, this is the first time since Federation, when the federal Audit Office was established, that such an exercise has been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in that context, Minister Beazley charged the public accounts committee with the task of reviewing that draft legislation. We have done our best to discharge that responsibility. I give credit to all of the members of that committee, particularly those who found it possible to participate fully in this inquiry. All of those members&mdash;I am talking about members from the opposition and the government, members from the House of Representatives and the Senate, members from the three major political parties represented in this place&mdash;who participated made a genuine and bipartisan approach and applied a diligent level of effort to that consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to commend the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Oxley. He is an outstanding chairman of the public accounts committee. He chairs the committee with tact and is able to encourage the best responses from members.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to extend that commendation to a very professional and competent secretariat. In particular, I want to mention Grant Harrison and James Catchpole, who were the principal officers of the secretariat involved. I also want to commend all of their colleagues, four of whom have accompanied Grant here to listen and be available if we need them for final advice. We are very well served in this place by officers of the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretariat's contribution was simply outstanding. As the honourable member for Fairfax pointed out, we have been charged with this responsibility only since June, and here is the report. There were many occasions when evidence was brought before the committee on which I did not feel confident to make a judgment, but the secretariat, because of its expertise, was able to show us where, in some cases, the evidence was in error or where it just represented simple confusion. The quality of this report depends greatly on people such as Grant and his colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mention has been made of the audit office, the Department of Finance, individual people, organisations, businesses, authorities, government bodies and departmental officers involved. All of them made a collective contribution to a very valuable and, indeed, essential exercise in the development of this report. We examined a large number of issues. I will not canvass them. My colleagues on the committee have already canvassed some. We will hopefully have the opportunity to look at some of those issues in more detail when the actual legislation is being debated here in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from commenting on the three draft bills, I just want to refer to the question of whether or not there should be a separate audit committee. I think not. As the member for Fairfax and his colleague the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) have indicated, the audit committee would very likely consist of essentially the same people who are on the public accounts committee. There were, I believe, good reasons why the suggestion was made that a separate audit committee should be established. I think the case we have made in that report more than adequately disposes of those points. I hope the government considers those as closely as we expect it to consider the others. I am sure it will. We examined a number of possible models to allow the public accounts committee to convene as an audit committee. The one we came down on the side of resulted from very close consideration of the various options we had identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise the point that I opened with. This process is a significant departure from what we have done in the past. I know the government would not have referred this draft legislation to us unless it wanted us to genuinely respond to it. We have genuinely responded. I know the government will give every consideration to those recommendations. It may be that the government cannot agree with them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations have been unanimously endorsed by the members of the committee. I accept the discipline necessary for the effective operation of political parties in this institution, which is the most important core of our whole liberal democratic framework in this country. The discipline of parties is essential. The government, having given honest and serious consideration to that report, will determine its position. It will do that through the normal forums and processes of the government. I will endorse that position. We all have to respect, understand and recognise that position. If we cannot understand, recognise and support that principle, then we may very well damage the motivation which lay behind that commendable decision by the Minister for Finance to refer those draft bills to a joint committee of this parliament. </PARA>

I thank my colleagues on the committee for their comments this morning in relation to the tabling of our previous report No. 331. I welcome this opportunity to table the 332nd report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which reviews two audit reports on the Australian government credit card. The first audit report was tabled in parliament in December of last year and a follow-up audit was tabled last June. Both reports attracted considerable public attention with occasional sensational articles appearing in the media. It was in this environment that the committee decided to review the credit card system and act, as it were, as the umpire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers that overall the Australian government credit card provides a useful purchasing tool for government agencies. However, there are areas at both the macro level, oversighted by the Department of Finance, and at the micro level, administered by individual agencies, where improvements can be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the macro level, the committee recommended that responsibility for oversight of the credit card system should remain with the Department of Finance, as this fits well with Finance's role as administrator of the public account and overseer of financial management policy. Consequently, the committee does not support the Auditor-General's suggestion that the Department of Administrative Services be responsible for the management of the credit card system or be the sole supplier of training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, credit card bills are paid through a system of agency settlement accounts. Although there is evidence that the settlement account system is not working as well as it should be, the committee is not convinced that the system should be abolished. Instead, the committee considers that the current system should be made to work better. We have recommended that various options to improve the system should be developed, tested and trialled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the micro level&mdash;the administration of credit cards by individual agencies&mdash;the committee has made several recommendations aimed at promoting tighter control. However, the committee found no evidence that the credit card system was subject to a greater level of fraud than any other method of payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current credit card contract expires in June 1995, and the committee considers it is opportune for the Department of Finance to obtain feedback from agencies concerning their experiences with the credit card with a view to incorporating improvements in the new contract. Finance should examine options for incorporating new product developments and improved statistical analysis and management reporting into the new contract. Also the contract should be flexible enough to enable the Commonwealth to take advantage of any product or technological improvements which may emerge over the life of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises that Commonwealth agencies operate in a devolved environment and are therefore responsible for administering the credit card system. Nevertheless, the committee considers that Finance, as the responsible central agency, should provide ongoing guidance and support to individual agencies to help promote the efficient and consistent use of credit cards throughout the Public Service. An example of the role that we believe Finance should play is to develop general guidelines on the appropriateness or otherwise of expenditure on items such as travel, hospitality, conferences and other staff related activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, until the Auditor-General decided to conduct an audit, the credit card system had not been evaluated since its introduction in 1987. Although the committee has not endorsed all of the Auditor-General's recommendations, I commend the audit office for focusing attention on this important issue. I believe that the work undertaken by the audit office has already resulted in significant improvements in the operation of the credit card system. I believe that our recommendations will produce still further improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the JCPA's secretariat has been acknowledged today by other members, but I do not think we can thank those officers enough for their hard work and their usual high standard of support for the committee members. I particularly want to thank Yolanda Campagna, Cliff Lawson, Ross Allen&mdash;who was with us for a while and who came back on a couple of occasions to assist in finalising this report&mdash;John Carter, and our secretary, Grant Harrison. I also thank the staff in the House of Representatives printing unit who assisted us in printing this report so promptly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Before I make a criticism of the use of credit cards, I want to make it quite clear that I think both sides of the House would support the use of credit cards by government agencies. The reason for that is that in the past governments have been notoriously slow in paying their bills. Many members of parliament have received complaints from constituents in business who have had to wait sometimes for months and months before they are paid the smallest amounts. It is quite frustrating. This situation was brought home to me many years ago when I worked for the then Minister for the Northern Territory. The secretary of the department, while driving from Darwin to Alice Springs on a familiarisation tour, tried to buy some petrol with a government voucher. The fellow at the garage said, `No way, mate! Not in your life! I'm not waiting six months to be paid for a few gallons of petrol.' Credit cards overcome this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland brought home to people the need for accountability, particularly with credit cards. Given the findings of Fitzgerald on the misuse of credit cards, I do not think anyone on the public payroll has any excuse not to know that the severest of penalties should apply to misuse of any Commonwealth funds. It is true that the committee received no evidence to indicate that the level of fraud associated with credit cards was greater than that associated with other methods of payment. However, there are two aspects to which I would like to draw attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is that credit cards are perhaps more open to fraud and misuse than any other means of payment. This is because the decision to purchase can be made by the card holder alone, and only after the payment has been made are the agency checks activated. This is in contrast with the cheque based system, where two or three people may be involved before the payment is effected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect which is not covered in the report but which is nonetheless an important issue is expenses incurred by ministers and ministerial staff. The credit card is issued to ministers' offices by their home departments, but when  ministerial staff claim travel allowance they do so from the Department of Administrative Services, a totally different agency. Thus there arises a real possibility of double dipping&mdash;paying for travel related expenses on the credit card acquitted through the home department and claiming travel allowance from DAS. I have no evidence that this has happened, but the system is open to that sort of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of double dipping in relation to travel allowance has been addressed by one of the committee's recommendations which advocates the use of the credit card for travel related expenses only where there are appropriate systems in place to check credit card expenditure against any travel allowance that might have been paid. I think ministers' home departments should pay special attention to credit card expenditure by ministerial officers and liaise with DAS to make sure that double dipping does not occur. There is another aspect to be considered when ministers or staff use credit cards for accommodation or meals. I believe a fringe benefits tax liability could well be incurred. I believe agencies should monitor that carefully and make sure their obligations are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by elaborating on a remark made by the committee chairman, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), concerning some of the more sensational reports in the media relating to unusual credit card transactions. The committee reviewed several of the purchases reported in the media&mdash;for example, expenditure on lingerie by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service for a patient undergoing hydrotherapy treatment; and the purchase of sunglasses, which caused quite a sensation and much media interest. The sunglasses were used by Australian troops engaged in United Nations peacekeeping operations in the Western Sahara. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure of this type is clearly official and appropriate, although the fact that the legitimacy of these transactions was not immediately evident to the Auditor-General points to a deficiency in the audit trail. It was this sort of sensationalised environment that the committee found itself in when it reviewed the audit reports. I think that, in supporting the use of the credit card, the committee has acted as a good umpire and should not allow itself to be influenced by the roar of the crowd. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to make a short statement on report 332 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the Australian government credit card. I do not think anybody will argue against the benefits that accrue not only to Commonwealth departments in easing their operations but also, more importantly, to the people in the private sector that we deal with when settling the accounts of government purchases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important elements in this report were highlighted by the Auditor-General. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), indicated, there was a certain amount of embellishment in some of the examples that were used in the auditor's report which, on inspection, were quite legitimate but they certainly made good reading in the national media for a few days. There were examples of larger items of expenditure and these made for good reading too. That scrutiny by the media also made for a bit more accountability and transparency in the process of the use of the Australian government credit card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of the important recommendations in this report revolve around the education of the officers using the system, the issuing of the cards and the operation of the settlement accounts. Recommendation 2 of the report states:</PARA>

<PARA>That is very important. I think something like 16,000 or 18,000 of these cards are in use. To maintain control, and to maintain the level of knowledge of how these cards should be used, it is important we implement that process. Recommendation 3 states:</PARA>

<PARA>These are the areas I want to touch on in my speech this morning. Recommendation 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All agency heads should:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)ensure that credit cards are issued on the basis of need rather than status;</PARA>
<PARA>A very important element of the recommendations is contained here: the cards should be issued on the basis of need rather than status. Keeping in mind, on the one hand, the frequency of purchases of a particular department and, on the other, the fact that the private operator is providing a service or goods to the Commonwealth, the department should make sure that the accounts are settled within a reasonable time. Recommendation 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All agency heads should:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)ensure that Australian Government Credit Cards are used for travel related purposes only where there are appropriate systems in place to check against any travel allowance that might have been paid to the relevant cardholder and to check expenditure against entitlements;</PARA>
<PARA>I know this point was raised by the previous speaker, the member for Fairfax, but it cannot be emphasised strongly enough that this be monitored, that the process&mdash;particularly in this area&mdash;be absolutely transparent and that there be accountability on those aspects. That is one area where many people in different states of Australia involved in government and the bureaucracy fell into a bit of a trap. This government should be very mindful of the pitfalls in that area concerning double dipping. The auditor highlighted that aspect as a possibility for abuse. The ministers and the departmental heads in charge of officers of the Commonwealth who have the use of an Australian government credit card should certainly watch for those pitfalls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most alarming element in looking at the process of how a credit card is used; how the goods are charged; and how the statements come in, are checked and are passed on for payment concerned overdrawn settlement accounts, which were to the tune of $34 million during 1992-93. The system was not designed with the intention that settlement accounts be overdrawn. Anybody who has a private credit card, whether it is theirs or their spouse's, does not overdraw on it. The idea is to charge the goods and pay the account within one month so it attracts minimum interest. The banks would love such an overdraft. Part 2.14 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ANAO survey of 419 Settlement Accounts for the month of May 1993 showed that about three quarters of them were out of balance after the May sweeping cycle.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that after the time that those accounts should have been settled, 75 per cent of them had not been because the paperwork had not been done. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of those out of balance, about two thirds were overdrawn, and one third overfunded. The total balance of overdrawn accounts was approximately $35 million, and approximately $1.3 million for overfunded accounts. The net overdraft balances of the Settlement Accounts averaged about $34 million during 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, the system was never devised with the intention of those accounts being in that situation. When the cards are used, they should be at least square with the account when the reimbursement comes in. They should not be overdrawn. There is a challenge before the government. In progressing the educational process within departments about the use of the Australian government credit card, the challenge is there to make sure that the system works properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The system is probably more cumbersome than the operation of a private credit card. But if the system is to work correctly and if the Commonwealth, and ultimately the taxpayers, are to get maximum advantage, we should ensure that the process is adhered to. As stated in the report, there is a challenge before the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I acknowledge the hard work and diligence of the secretariat in putting this report together, and in assisting the committee in its deliberations on report 332. I certainly support the recommendations in the report and trust that the government will be cognisant of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Departure Tax Amendment Bill, together with the Departure Tax Collection Bill 1994, implements the government's decision announced in the 1994 budget to replace the existing departure tax with a passenger movement charge to achieve full cost recovery for customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and to achieve the cost of the issue of short-term visitor visas. The cost of these services has been calculated at $27 per departing passenger. Today we are being asked to agree to this new system of collecting departure tax. We are also being asked to agree to the increase from $25 to $27 per passenger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that this is a budget bill, I understand the convention is that we will not oppose it. However, I want to say very clearly in my contribution to this debate that I am opposed to the continual imposition of new taxes on the tourism industry. I call this a tax because I notice the government prefers to call this a charge. The government has a history of calling taxes anything other than taxes. We have superannuation guarantee levies, training guarantee levies, and today we have the replacement of a departure tax with a passenger movement charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us not be caught up in this. Let us not misunderstand the intention. We are talking about government revenue raising. We are talking about taxation. More importantly, from my point of view, we are talking about the taxation of the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is very important to Australia. It has taken a long time for the government to realise how important tourism is to Australia. It is one of our greatest sources of overseas earnings, if not our greatest source&mdash;depending on how it is defined. The definition of the industry is of itself a problem. It is essentially an industry which earns export dollars for Australia, yet that has not been fully grasped. It is not digging things out of the ground, cutting wool off the sheep's back or manufacturing and sending goods out of the country. Nevertheless, in effect it earns money for Australia by bringing tourists to Australia who spend their money here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be very clearly understood that the tourism industry is an export industry. The sooner we come to a full realisation of that, and come to grips with the implications of that, we will begin to treat the tourism industry as the important contributor to the Australian economy it really is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism is the lifeblood of my Gold Coast based electorate. In 1992-93 the Gold Coast had almost two million domestic visitors and just over 500,000 overseas visitors. Those two groups of visitors combined spent almost 14 million visitor nights on the Gold Coast. Tourism is very important to Australia, particularly to my electorate. The taxation impact on this industry is an important element. Today we are being asked to agree to a further imposition of tax on the tourism industry. That is contrary to the interests of an industry which is important to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total tax collected from tourists leaving Australia will be $140 million&mdash;not only from domestic tourists leaving Australia but also from foreign tourists leaving Australia. The effect of this measure on the cost to a tourist coming to Australia might be considered fairly marginal. But, in the end, how inelastic does the government think demand for tourism is? It obviously takes the point of view that it can continue to slug tourists who come to Australia in all sorts of ways. We are talking about the total taxes that visiting tourists have to pay. How far can we go before we reach the point where Australia is too expensive a destination? Our tourism industry is competing in a very competitive industry on a worldwide basis. We are attempting to attract tourists from Europe, Asia and America. And we are competing against many other parts of the world that are equally concerned to gain as much benefit as they can from their tourism industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt in my mind that Australia has a fabulous product to sell. We ought not to undersell it. In many respects, we have done that in recent years. We have undersold many of the wonderful attributes we have in this country. We have a marvellous tourism destination. I make no apology for saying that my electorate, the Gold Coast, is a world-class tourism destination. That is not only reinforced by the number of Australians who go there&mdash;it is the most popular tourist destination for Australians&mdash;but also by the number of overseas tourists. The Gold Coast is certainly a world-class destination&mdash;not only because of what has been created there, with its attractions and its standard of accommodation, but also because of its marvellous natural environment, which we go to great pains to maintain. We have clean water that people can swim in, and we have a wonderful hinterland with national parks that border the Gold Coast. In that sense, it is a marvellous destination which we should not undersell. We need to be acutely aware that Australia is competing internationally for overseas visits. How far can we go in continuing to add costs to a ticket fare to Australia before we start discouraging people from coming here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Governments generally have always assisted primary industries. They have assisted mining and quarrying. They have poured money into developing our film industry. They have put money into research and development. Why? These are important industries to Australia. They are industries which have generated export earnings for Australia. The tourism industry has received very little assistance from the government. The tourism industry does not want government handouts, and it is does not necessarily want subsidies. It wants to be recognised for what it is&mdash;an export industry&mdash;and to be treated equally with other export industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge raft of taxes which are imposed on the tourism industry&mdash;industry specific taxes&mdash;put it at a considerable competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis other countries which do not tax their tourism industries in the same way. I challenge the government to treat the industry as it treats other industries. Let me mention the most glaring and obvious matter that came up in recent days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been prepared to go to enormous lengths apparently to rescue the Australian National Line. The shipping line is losing a fortune for Australia. It has accumulated losses on its balance sheet of, I think, $180 million. It is broke, as the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) told us. It is not even worth selling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done a deal with the shipping line that it has not done with anyone else in Australia. The employees, members of the maritime union, for the sake of helping to rescue the line&mdash;I am not sure exactly how this does that&mdash;will not have to pay income tax in the future. The people who work for the Australian national shipping line will be the only people in Australia who, for some reason or another, will be exempt from paying income tax. That is hardly equal treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the recession which this country has endured in recent years, the tourism industry has continued to grow. Also, let us not forget that it suffered very badly as a result of the 1989 pilots strike. I might coincidentally, for the benefit of government members, contrast the way the government handled the pilots strike with the way that it handled the recent strike on Australia's wharves. </PARA>

The Prime Minister of the day did everything he could to inflame the pilots strike. The cost of the 1989 pilots strike to Australia's tourism industry would have measured in billions of dollars. The pilots were not the mates of the government. Mr Hawke said that. He called them `glorified bus drivers', which of course was insulting; it inflamed the whole situation.

The pilots strike cost the tourism industry in this country dearly. The worst affect was not so much on destinations like the Gold Coast but on some of the more remote destinations. The member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) is in the chamber. If he were to tell us about the pilots strike, he would say that it cost the tourism industry in the Townsville area enormously. The pilots strike went on and on and on. There was no rush to do a deal, as there was when the wharfies went on strike. What was the difference? The difference was that the wharfies were the mates of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism industry is labour intensive. It provides many entry level jobs, both full- and part-time, for both men and women&mdash;particularly young men and women. For that reason, it is important to Australia&mdash;not only as an export industry. There has been a lot of discussion about the impact of taxes on the tourism industry&mdash;taxes such as the training levy, the superannuation levy, the wholesale sales tax, and the fringe benefits tax, which has gone absolutely mad. It is a plethora of garbage that nobody can sort their way through. The fringe benefits tax has an enormous impact on the tourism industry and the hospitality industry. It has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. The government suddenly found that it had this fantastic way of raising money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that a review of the fringe benefits tax is going on at this moment&mdash;and rightly so. The fringe benefits tax has impacted heavily on the tourism industry. We have payroll tax, land tax, stamp duty, capital gains tax. We are almost taxed out of existence in this country. This morning we are being asked to approve another tax, or `charge' as the government prefers to call it. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is still a tax. It is an extension of the government's tax and spend budget, the strategy of which has totally failed anyway because the government's whole plan was underwritten by its plan to sell government or taxpayers' or Australian owned assets for the sake of raising money to meet its commitments. The government seems highly unlikely to be able to deliver on that plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This departure tax is predicated on and justified by, from what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) has said in his second reading speech, cost recovery. Cost recovery is a new concept but, once again, it is one that governments have readily rushed into as a way of collecting more revenue. Another neat little trick used by governments to collect more money is the concept of `user pays'. The concept of user pays is quite rational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in this and many other cases at federal, state and local government level where there is this great commitment to user pays government has decided to measure the cost of a particular service and then, of course, how much per taxpayer it will cost to recover that&mdash;hence user pays has been introduced. But governments do not reduce their other revenue. That is where we are tricked into perhaps accepting that user pays is a good idea. It perhaps would be if it were applied consistently and if the result were that less tax was collected. But that is not the case with user pays. We are often tricked into accepting user pays, because it is a rational concept, without realising that very often the net effect is that we end up paying more not only for what the user charge is for but for what we were already paying for in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of user pays is one of those things which we might ultimately consign to the same category of ideas as those covered by the statement Gareth Evans made&mdash;it was something that seemed like a good idea at the time&mdash;but which come back to haunt us. That is now the rationale for a huge range of new charges, as I say, often on top of the existing tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departure tax of itself may not be too objectionable in the sense that governments have to raise revenue somehow; they are always looking at creative ways of raising revenue, just as taxpayers, through their accountants, are looking for more and more creative ways to avoid paying revenue. I suppose that is a battle that will go on forever. We introduced this departure tax concept back in 1978-79; it was then $10. But it was never entirely hypothecated, to use that technical term, on tourism promotion. Tourism promotion was part of the rationale for the departure tax, and that is a fairly appealing sort of a concept too&mdash;the concept of what is called, technically, `hypothecation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that more money needs to be put into the promotion of Australia as a destination; we need to do that to remain competitive. I recognise that the government has consistently put more and more money into tourism promotion, and the Australian Tourist Commission does a very good job in using those funds. But we now have the potential for this new passenger movement charge, which will be hidden in the ticket price. Nobody will know they are paying it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a consumption tax. It is like wholesale sales tax&mdash;it is a hidden tax. We found, when we tried to expose wholesale sales tax and replace it with a visible tax, that such a visible tax is very difficult to argue for. People actually prefer not to know about the tax. People have difficulty when we try to demonstrate that wholesale sales tax is a huge tax which collects billions of dollars; it is a consumption tax which applies to just about everything. So we are going to hide the departure tax now; it will become a hidden tax. But I guarantee that, whilst it is $27 this year, it will go up and nobody will know. It will go from $27 to $30; it will be $60 within five years, and nobody will know about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that the previous method of collection was not difficult and I am not even advocating that we continue with it. I accept that there has always been a better method of collecting this tax. It has always been difficult for people departing the country to find the cash they need. Often they will get to the immigration point and find that their ticket does not have its stamp. There have always been difficulties with departure tax, but the one endearing feature it had was that it was visible&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And honest and up-front, and we all knew we were paying it. My concern with this particular tax is that it will be hidden. I have no doubt&mdash;and Australian people, who are not silly, will have no doubt&mdash;that the government will now use this charge not to pay for what the government and the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech have said it would be paid for, and which added up to the $27. The minister made it quite clear that it would be used to meet the costs of customs, immigration and quarantine processing at Australia's borders and the cost of issue of short-term visitors visas. The government added up the costs&mdash;incidentally, without justifying them&mdash;of all those services. It assumed that those costs were somehow status quo and based on efficient practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But putting that argument aside, which is a whole new ball game, the government assumed the status quo, divided that by the number of people leaving Australia and came up with $27. That whole mechanism is flawed. That is what the government did with fuel excise when it was first introduced. The government said, `How much does it cost to maintain Australian roads; how many motorists are there, and how many litres of petrol do they use? This is what the fuel excise will be.' It was 5c a litre, but what is it now? It is 30c a litre and it is hidden. Every time we go to the petrol pump, we are not paying to maintain the roads that we use; we are putting money into the government's coffers. That is exactly what the government will do when it increases this charge, as it inevitably will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support this legislation because it is a budget measure. But I hope that, in the remarks I have made this morning, I have made very clear my objection to taxing tourism. It is an export industry, it deserves to be treated better and, until we treat it better, it will not be as successful as it has the huge potential to be. </PARA>

<PARA>The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill provides for the classification of films, publications and computer games. The agreement of the states and territories to the bill proceeding provides a unique opportunity, on a cooperative national basis, to make Australia's censorship laws more uniform and simple, with consequential benefits to the industry and the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is the Commonwealth's contribution to revising the current legislative structure in cooperation with the states and territories. When enacted, the bill will not be able to be brought into force until complementary state and territory enforcement legislation is enacted. The model state and territory legislation is currently being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's censorship laws are in an unsatisfactory state. They comprise regulations under the Customs Act 1901 which, among other matters, establish the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review, a Commonwealth administered Australian Capital Territory ordinance, and state and territory legislation. For many years, the Censorship Board has performed the classification function for films under state and territory legislation. There are considerable difficulties in administering the current laws as they are unnecessarily complicated and not uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this background in mind, the Australian Law Reform Commission was asked to report on how the laws could be simplified and made more uniform and efficient while preserving the cooperative nature of the current scheme. The commission presented its report on censorship procedure in 1991 and the bill has been prepared in consultation with the states and territories, following the recommendations in that report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reflecting the cooperative nature of Australia's censorship laws, the bill is for a federal act for the Australian Capital Territory under section 122 of the constitution. The Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation reserved to the Commonwealth the power to classify material for censorship purposes. This was to ensure that a national censorship scheme was preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and set out the procedures for classification. Classification decisions will be made in accordance with the national classification code and guidelines to help apply the code. Both the code and the guidelines must be agreed between the Commonwealth, states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new scheme, it is proposed that state and territory legislation will adopt, in enforcement laws, the classification decisions made under the Commonwealth act. It is the state and territory legislation that will, in effect, govern the submission of films, publications and computer games to the Classification Board for classification. It will also deal with the consequences, in the respective jurisdictions, of the different classifications given by the board to films, publications and computer games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recommending the structure reflected in the bill, the commission observed that it accurately reflects and maintains the balance of responsibilities that has currently been arrived at between Australian jurisdictions. It also recognises that, in relation to the classification criteria and categories, the Commonwealth, states and territories are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived from agreement between all jurisdictions. The commission noted that the benefit of the new scheme was that `there will be a single procedure, avoiding the overlaps and duplications that presently exist, and the classifiers will derive their powers from a single source, removing the difficulty that they sometimes face now of conflicting legislation from different jurisdictions'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislative scheme is an excellent example of cooperative federalism. For example, the bill will only apply by its own force in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. The extent to which classification decisions under it have effect in other jurisdictions is a matter entirely for the state or territory concerned. The Commonwealth and the states and territories have equal voting rights in settling the criteria and guidelines under which classification decisions are made. The states and territories are given the right to be consulted about appointments to the two boards, and the states and territories will receive a guaranteed share of the revenue from fees collected to assist with enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case all states do not agree to adopt the classifications under the Commonwealth act in relation to films, publications and computer games, the bill, in order to preserve a national scheme, makes provision for the states and the Northern Territory to confer functions on the Classification Board under their own legislation in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the jurisdiction concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is essentially procedural in nature and reflects the current approach to censorship matters agreed by the Commonwealth, states and territories. Under the bill, material will continue to be classified on the basis of the principles that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, that children should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and that everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive. The bill also introduces a new principle, namely, the need to take account of community concerns about depictions which condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence, and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the unsatisfactory state of our current laws, Australia is at the forefront of other comparable countries in its approach to censorship matters. The basic approach adopted is to give adults sufficient information, through the classifications given to material and the consumer advice provided, to make an informed choice about what they want to see, hear or read and what material they allow their children to have access to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note from a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey, commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, that significant use is made of the classification system by adults in selecting suitable viewing for their children and themselves. In relation to the content of the material to be found in the various classifications, I and my state and territory counterparts are well aware of the genuine concern in some sections of the community about the amount of violence in films and the possible harmful effects this might have on children and some adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments have already taken positive action to address community concerns. The measures include the tightening up by censorship ministers of the guidelines for the M and R classifications, the introduction of the new MA classification, and a stricter regime for the classification of computer games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of whether classification decisions reflect community attitudes and thereby enjoy general community acceptance is ultimately dependent on the individual and collective decisions of the people who constitute the two classification boards. There is a need, recognised by all censorship ministers, to ensure that the board members who make the classification decisions on behalf of the community are, as far as practicable, broadly representative of that community. I have been paying close attention to the composition of the current boards in consultation with my state and territory colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that board members remain aware of community attitudes, the Censorship Board has, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, a continuing community consultation program which includes arranging for ordinary members of the public to come in and review films and indicate the classification and consumer advice that they would award to them. This is supplemented by research projects on community standards, the results of which are made available to board members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the provisions of the bill itself, I have already mentioned that it establishes the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. It also contains procedural provisions relating to applications, decision making, the notification of decisions and the review of decisions. As the government intends to establish the Office of Film and Literature Classification&mdash;which services the two boards&mdash;as a separate business unit, there are also standard financial and accounting provisions in the bill to achieve this end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new scheme, the current compulsory classification of all films and videos will continue. In relation to publications, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the current voluntary scheme be replaced by a partially compulsory scheme, and this is reflected in the bill. Under this scheme, publications will be classified by the new Classification Board and not departmental officers, as at present. A partially compulsory scheme is achieved by, in effect, requiring publications that straddle the category 1 restricted classification, which is the lowest classification for restricted publications, and the upper end of the unrestricted category to be submitted for classification. Failure to do so will be an offence under state and territory legislation. This should result in many more publications being submitted for classification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the bill will enable the director to call in publications that fall within this class&mdash;which are called submittable publications in the bill&mdash;for classification. Failure to abide by the director's request will be an offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes provisions to enable the classification of computer games. An interim scheme to enable computer games to be classified was introduced earlier this year through amendments to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983, which is administered by the Commonwealth. Following the decision of the states and territories to not allow `X' or `R' classified computer games to be available, the bill makes no provision for these classifications. It also clarifies the definition of `computer game' in response to anomalies arising from the interim scheme that have been brought to the attention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current arrangements, fees are levied under state and territory legislation, collected by the Commonwealth and shared equally between the Commonwealth, the states and the Northern Territory. The bill provides for the Commonwealth to levy classification fees in the future. In return for the states and territories forgoing their fee powers, and in recognition of their enforcement costs, it is proposed that they each receive the average of their share over the last five years&mdash;a total of $600,000 in 1994-95. This amount will be adjusted in future years by changes in the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also enable the Commonwealth to increase, over several years, charges for classification services so that there is substantial cost recovery. This will be done by introducing charges for new initiatives and increasing existing charges to reflect the cost of the service provided, thereby providing savings to the Commonwealth. These changes will not only fund the government's initiatives to address the community need for readily accessible classification advice but also enable the provision of a more efficient and timely service to clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, as introduced, was discussed at the most recent meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory censorship ministers. As a result of the decisions taken at that meeting, and other matters that have arisen since the bill was introduced, the government will be moving some miscellaneous amendments to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this bill represents a significant advance in an area which has a daily impact on the Australian community. It is a welcome cooperative initiative between all Australian governments. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

The concerns of the opposition and other members of the Senate can be properly addressed in that forum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties will therefore say more on this subject when the report is tabled in the Senate. In particular, I have no doubt that my colleague Senator Vanstone, the shadow Attorney-General, who has carriage of this matter on behalf of the coalition parties, will speak on the issue in the Senate in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) said in his second reading speech, this bill is the product of a cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the states and follows the examination of this issue by the Law Reform Commission, which culminated in its publication of a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Censorship procedure</EMPHASIS>. The bill proposes to establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and sets out the procedures for the classification of publications, films and computer games. Classification decisions will comply with the national classification code and guidelines, which help to apply the code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When enacted, the bill will not come into effect until complementary state and territory legislation is enacted. I understand that model state and territory legislation is currently being drafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a range of concerns which, as I say, I know will be given greater airing in the committee. Very briefly, the sorts of concerns include those which relate to bulletin boards. I understand that the amendments foreshadowed by the Attorney-General, of which we have received copies, delete the exclusion of computer bulletin boards from the definitions of  `computer game' and `film'. According to the explanatory memorandum, it will be on this basis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">while the Government has not made a decision on the regulation of material on computer bulletin boards, the removal of this exclusion will allow the Classification Board to classify material on computer bulletin boards should there be a future requirement . . . to do so.</PARA>
<PARA>This move would appear to include bulletin boards in the ambit of the bill, although the explanatory memorandum states that, under the bill, there will be no requirement to submit material on computer bulletin boards for classification until there is some compulsion to do so&mdash;for example, through a</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth, state or offence provision. A representation we have had from PD Software Services claims that the previous exclusion of bulletin boards is unfair, because game sellers who sold their product via bulletin boards would not have the burden of the classification fee. One question is this: what is the situation now, taking account of the amendments? Hopefully, that question can be answered in the Senate's inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues relating to the definition of `computer game'. It may be that it does not include the soundtrack of the game. That may be a matter of some contention, depending on the nature of that material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I am told that the Video Industry Distributors Association has made representations concerning the exemptions in the definition of `film'. It apparently contends that the exemptions&mdash;business, accounting, professional, scientific or educational&mdash;should be extended to include classical music and sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has apparently also been a representation from a firm called Brilliant Interactive Ideas concerning sex education products. It produces educational CD ROMs. I understand that it is concerned that its products would receive the R classification and, thus, would be unsuitable for students. It has apparently been advised previously by the Office of Film and Literature Classification that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . each item of software that contains elements which may be contentious will be examined on its merits in terms of the classification scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The question is how this will sit with the bill's definition of `computer game' or `film'. Again, it is a matter that I believe is appropriately dealt with in the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity of moving from the particular to the general. I am pleased that it was in the second reading speech of the minister that, in principle, adults should be free to read, see, or hear whatever they choose. However, this principle must be qualified and subject to some restrictions in the interests of community standards, the safety of people and, in particular, the protection of children. Subjects such as child pornography, bestiality, sexual violence, incitement to drug taking, terrorist activity and exhibitions of extreme violence should be completely banned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People also need to be properly informed about the material which might be available to them, with suitable warnings to advise people of material which might be offensive or harmful, particularly to children. So an information campaign must be an important aspect of Australia's censorship laws. This framework, which has been established in this cooperative way, attempts to deal with that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in modern times, technological advances have made a lot more material a lot more available. Video material has presented a particular problem because of the easy access to it by children. I have four sons and my wife and I, like many parents, sometimes wonder when the younger ones are off to stay with one of their mates overnight whether or not the parents require the same high standards as we do. This bill brings about a responsibility on politicians and our legal system to ensure that we have a fair and balanced approach to the availability of the material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the coalition have been concerned for some years now that out of the ACT, for example, the federal government allows the distribution of X-rated material. I have been the lower House representative for the shadow Attorney-General only since the resignation of Mr Andrew Peacock, but I have held the position of shadow Attorney-General once before. This was a major issue six or seven years ago, so I got out the Canberra <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages </EMPHASIS>this morning to see where we were at on the X-rated video debate. I can tell the House that X-rated material must still be very much in distribution, because there is page after page of it advertised. Of course, a lot of X-rated material was advertised as mail order. I think this is an area where members of the federal government are out of touch with community opinion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than that; it actually believed that that material ought to be available. Rather than failing to make a decision, it has positively continued to support the distribution of X-rated material to make Canberra the porn capital of Australia. Recognising the various points of view on this issue, I say to the minister at the table, the Attorney-General, that he is out of touch with community opinion. Whilst I hold out no expectation that he will move on that issue, he should. It reflects very poorly on the government's attitude to this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at these issues, ultimately one has to go back to basic principles. I have outlined very briefly the libertarian principle that people ought to be able to see, read and hear whatever they choose, subject to qualification. Qualification is important because a fair bit of evidence suggests that there is or may be a link between the material that people see and people's conduct. For example, television may reinforce attitudes, if not create them. Television may sometimes trigger a violent response in a person who may have had a propensity for such violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen incidents over the years referred to as copycat effects. The Hoddle Street massacre in Melbourne was one. The Hungerford incident was an English equivalent, where the perpetrator of a violent crime was wearing a Rambo headband. No-one can prove causal links, but the advertising industry spends billions and billions of dollars every year as it believes that, through the medium of television and advertising generally, people's behaviour can be influenced. Particularly when it comes to children, I do not think that we as a society can ignore the sense that there may well on some occasions be a link. That places a responsibility on us in the legislature to ensure that we have a proper framework for the adoption of proper standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not oppose this bill. We want to see a proper framework established. As I understand it, the framework that is being established will also allow the states to, by their own act, inject into the system their own views where they have a differing view from the national scheme. In other words, we have a national scheme, but I understand from my reading that that will allow some diversity. Provided that can be done in an efficient way and not add confusion to the system unnecessarily, then that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to contrast the proud boast of the Attorney-General of his cooperative attitude to this legislation and establishing this censorship regime to the attitude the Commonwealth takes on other matters when dealing with the states. We often hear it said that these debates are all about human rights versus state rights. It is a very glib and easy thing to say but, of course, it betrays a much more substantial debate which is ongoing in Australian society; that is, the debate about who should make decisions, the debate about the distribution of power. When it comes to censorship decisions, a government of a state may have a different view from that which we in the national capital have. But it seems to me quite reasonable that we should have a system whereby&mdash;subject to some other considerations, but as a general rule&mdash;when people in a particular state have a particular view, their views can be reflected in their state parliament and in their local laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a good idea. Not all wisdom resides in Canberra. That would not only give us a more diverse society but also go to one of the absolutely fundamental characteristics of Australian society&mdash;one which I hope will be stronger and not weaker in the future, and that is certainly my aim and, I believe, the aim of people on this side of politics&mdash;which is that we are trying to build in the future a more participatory system of government. We want people to be involved in government. I have been here for 10 years and I have great respect for all my colleagues. They are wonderful people and my policy is a very simple one: we love them all. But they do not always get it right. If we can have a political system where decisions are made by the people most affected by them, we will have a far better political system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we have a cooperative approach on a matter such as this. I welcome the attempts of the state ministers to ensure a cooperative system. It is in very sharp contrast to what the Attorney-General said yesterday when I asked him on a different matter&mdash;constitutional arrangements&mdash;whether or not he would consider it a live option for the Commonwealth, in establishing a republic, to actually put up a referendum to knock off a state's constitution against the wishes of the majority of its electors. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House, in providing that legislative framework for the Australian Capital Territory, will form the centrepiece of national uniform legislation. Federal, state and territory governments all have powers over censorship of films and publication. For its part, the Commonwealth has relied on the customs power derived from section 51 of our constitution for legislation to control the import of material which might prove offensive to the general community. But this division of power has developed a complex network of laws between the jurisdictions. Hardly surprisingly, shifts in community attitudes and increasingly sophisticated technologies have created a further overlay of problems for regulators. In recent years it has become apparent that a need exists for a national unified approach in this sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In formulating this legislation, our government has been guided by recommendations from the 1991 Law Reform Commission report, research findings of the Commonwealth Office of Film and Literature Classification, which is referred to as OFLC, a Senate select committee and the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers. With variations on each other's findings, including that there is a high degree of public concern about the impact of video games on children, the gist of those groups' recommendations is that children should not have easy access to offensive, violent and sexually explicit material, that there should be a national classification scheme to overcome some of the difficulties and shortcomings in regulating certain aspects of computer technology, in particular, and that the provision of warnings relating to films and literature apply equally to computer games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nature of the many games where players are able to participate actively, legislation to impose stricter classifications is relevant. Against that background, our federal government has acted, remaining mindful of the importance of maintaining a balance of responsibilities between jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government has always been cognisant of the need to respect people's rights to freedom of expression and privacy. To be a responsible government, we must ensure that our children are protected from material likely to harm or to disturb them and that people are protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they may find offensive. But the mere hint of censorship becomes very tricky indeed, invoking spirited and heated debate. It can be a particularly vexed issue, irrespective of the stance that one might take. Writers and playwrights find it difficult at times to get it right. Conveying their true messages is not always easy to do without offending somebody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil libertarians might note, however, that the argument these days is about more than just the reading of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Chatterley's Lover</EMPHASIS>. Some computer games involve serious depictions of violence, such as Knight Trap, where players seek to defend a group of college students from being molested and mutilated by a group of zombies or, another one, Mortal Kombat, where the player pushes the opponent off a ledge and impales him on a sharpened spike, having the option of electrocuting the opponent and then either ripping out the still beating heart or tearing off the head and holding it aloft with its spinal cord dangling. These are games that our children have available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another very bad one is Custer's Last Stand, which involves the rape of American Indian women by uniformed soldiers. Often pornography centres on the hatred of women. It is not uncommon, therefore, to see women physically immobilised and abused, bound, trussed, gagged and mutilated. Little wonder that community concern has increased. Phillip Adams, who is renowned for his civil libertarian stance, was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>on 23 April 1994 as expressing dismay at the escalation of nastiness he sees in both popular media and in high art, especially in film, as technology goes on providing bigger and more convincing thrills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sources from the video industry itself acknowledge a need for guidelines. Speaking on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program on 14 June 1993, the managing director of Sega-Ozisoft, Kevin Burmeister, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've currently introduced censorship teams within our own organisation, but that's as an interim measure. We are hoping to work with the censorship authorities to make sure that we do develop that action that we are taking, but we are crying out and looking for some guideline.</PARA>
<PARA>That is from the people who put these games together. Video shop operators may complain that censorship rules will detrimentally affect business. So what? Conceivably though, the classification system may be the industry's only hope of continuing successfully in the face of such widespread public concern. Video games are pervasive. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures&mdash;again I refer to April 1994&mdash;commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification of film, videos and computer games, reveal that, of households with children aged one to 12, 58.1 per cent of the children had watched a videotape and 46.4 per cent had played a computer game in the previous fortnight. In households that have 13- to 17-year-olds, 54 per cent of the children had watched a videotape and 50.5 per cent of the children had played a computer game in that previous fortnight. A high percentage of parents interviewed held serious reservations about the content of the games. Importantly though, that survey showed that a large number of adults used a classification system in selecting appropriate material for their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parents and guardians, I believe, are entitled to know what their children and young teenagers are watching or participating in. Consumer information is available on the packets of all kinds of other products, so why not on these goods as well? Research about community standards commissioned by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the OFLC showed clearly that people wanted a clearer distinction between M and R classifications. Many people wanted a scheme which would advise what level of sex, violence or coarse language to expect. For television, 89 per cent of the population agreed with this statement while, for film and video, the figure was 87 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arguments on censorship have raged since Socrates' day between the libertarian and authoritarian perspectives. Contemporary arguments centre on the correlation between violent and sexually explicit material and the violence expressed. Critics of video games, I know, charge that many are violent, sexist and racist, providing negative role models for children. A recent study by the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia indicates that teachers found that many of those video games encourage emotional detachment and promoted questionable values and unacceptably negative responses in real life situations&mdash;these are our children they are talking about&mdash;of the shoot `em down, bash `em up ilk. We do not know how an adolescent's concept of sexuality is shaped while gazing at pornographic videos. In the past 30 years a number of psychologists&mdash;Zillmann, Bryant, Malamuth and Donnerstein are the most prominent&mdash;have conducted hundreds of laboratory experiments into the effects of pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly, this research has demonstrated that a diet of either violent or non-violent but degrading pornography has a profound and negative effect on the socio-sexual attitudes of our young population. It has also shown that male university students who are exposed to such kinds of pornography become desensitised to sexual brutality. They become more aggressive and callous towards women, more willing to believe that women are responsible for their own rapes, more tolerant of rapists, of rape fantasies in themselves, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many statistical indicators link the consumption of pornography and the commission of sexual crime. According to one study of 36 serial killers in the USA conducted by the FBI, 29 were attracted to pornography and incorporated it into their sexual activity, which included serial rape-murder. Another study of more than 35,000 sexual offenders conducted again in the USA by the Michigan Police found that in 41 per cent of all sexual assault cases pornography was involved in, just prior to or during, the act. A Chicago Police study found that pornography was incorporated in one way or another in almost 100 per cent of the paedophilia cases that they dealt with. Sexual serial killer Ted Bundy, executed in America several years ago, described reaching a point where pornography only went so far and wondering `if maybe actually doing it would give you that which is beyond just reading or looking at it'. Such evidence may not be conclusive, but it surely must be of interest and concern to us, the legislators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former head of the Australian Institute of Criminology, Professor Duncan Chappell, who chaired the 1990 study by the National Committee on Violence, says that the causes of violence are extremely complex and that simple answers are not always available. The solution itself does not lie just in banning violent television programs, films, videos and video games outright but in helping our children become more discerning consumers. I believe the classification scheme contained in the bill before the House will assist us as parents to make informed choices about the games our children play and participate in and will certainly ensure that our children are not exposed to material deemed unsuitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the scheme, computer games will be labelled in a general viewing category ranging from G to MA. Because of the nature of interactive computer games, the level of violence attracting an M rating in film and video would be likely to be rated MA in computer games. This is reassuring. Similarly, the computer game equivalent of a film that might be borderline between MA and R will now be covered by a Refused Classification rating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation can work well and we must make sure it does. Cooperative agreements are in place, recognising that the Commonwealth and the states and territories are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived from agreement between those jurisdictions. As has already been stated, the bill will not be brought into force until complementary state and territory enforcement legislation is enacted. As well, the new legislative scheme allows for a range of cooperative mechanisms between the Commonwealth government and the states and territories. These are: the appointments to the classification boards, voting rights, classification decisions and apportionment of revenue collected in&mdash;this is important&mdash;a flexible framework administered by each jurisdiction according to its particular needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill allows for continuing community consultation on the censorship board and for ordinary members of the public to be represented on classification boards, in line with the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendation, I believe is testimony to the consultative approach of our government. Further, as with films and videos, the Commonwealth will classify material according to an agreed classification system. Each jurisdiction, however, will decide which classifications it will admit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us does provide remedies for people concerned that particular computer games on the market that I am referring to have not been classified. Such games can be called in by the censorship authorities, and so they should. Penalties are in place for anyone deliberately not presenting a game for classification. These safeguards are necessary for many reasons, not the least of which is to help protect our most valuable asset, our children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to support this bill before the House. I certainly hope and trust that when the Senate committee deals with this bill it will look realistically to what the community is asking for and, particularly, will recommend little alteration to the bill. It can only improve&mdash;we can only go from strength to strength&mdash;but at least this bill provides the framework on which we can build as a Commonwealth and as a nation. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), I commend all those who have been involved in a lot of years of work in bringing this together and I hope and trust the legislation has community support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994 is one of the most important bills to come before this House, dealing as it does with the potential for children and young adults to be exposed to moral degradation through advances in technology. The high technology of the times presents a new social problem and creates a new issue for the parliament to consider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The huge advance in the availability of offensive and violent material is simply frightening. These days it is possible for a child or young teenager to turn on the computer and call up the sort of material that was previously only available as a `video nasty'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing we in this House must remember is that we are dealing with an increasingly complex problem. I suspect that this is not the last time the House and the community at large will be considering just how to combat this problem of access by young people, unbeknown to their parents or guardians, to violent and sexually explicit material. However, it does need to be said that the parliament is facing up to its responsibility and is coping with the issue as best it can, at this stage at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not dealing today with a problem that is static; we are dealing with today's problem and a future problem because technology will continue to march on and access to all sorts of material, both educational and destructive, will become easier day by day. For that reason we must now take a strong line and do something that will deter those in the community who take advantage of youthful vulnerability or curiosity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me is the potential for misuse of the home computer. On making inquiries in response to concerns by particular constituents but also in response to concerns already prevalent in the wider community, I have found, as have so many other members and of course the government&mdash;hence the legislation&mdash;that pornographic, violent and other immoral material is distributed through what are known as computer bulletin boards. This is the name given to a centralised pool of computerised information&mdash;pictures, moving images and games. Generally speaking, access is available to anyone who has a computer and a modem, provided the user knows the passwords and codes. With computers so common in homes now, it is no problem for children highly skilled in the use of computers to access this information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The gravest concern I have is that bulletin boards can be used to convey images of pornography, including the basest forms of pornography, and violence and to give information about drugs. A major problem of this potentially out of control use is that normal parental control is often circumvented or limited by the technology available. Many parents do not have the knowledge required to even see what their children have access to, let alone to make an evaluation of its content and suitability for children's viewing. What is more, many parents do not, at the moment, regard computers in the same light as videos and television. To many parents, the computer is a new way of doing homework. So many parents do not yet realise the deleterious effect the computer can have on their children if misused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a recent survey showed that in households containing one- to 12-year-olds, nearly 80 per cent of parents had a close look at a video before they allowed their children to watch it. It is very commendable and very reassuring to see that 80 per cent of parents take their responsibilities so seriously. But, sadly, only 45 per cent of parents were involved in choosing computer games. We cannot blame parents for that; there is yet to be a widely held apprehension about the potential misuse of computers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As children get older the problem increases. In households with 13- to 17-year-olds, that is, teenagers coping with or, in so many cases, struggling with emerging adulthood, only 28 per cent of parents were involved in choosing computer games. This means that, in many cases, teenagers and younger children virtually have free rein on computers without the capacity for parents to control what they do and watch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that must be made is the interactive nature of many computer games. It is one thing to watch a violent video; it is another thing altogether to be involved in the violence. That is what computer games can allow&mdash;the actual involvement in the assault or, in some of the worst cases, the rapes of the images on the computer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, let me draw to the attention of the House, as have other speakers earlier in this debate, a game called Mortal Kombat. According to reports, this is the goriest and most explicitly violent video game ever to go on sale. I have not seen the game. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> recently reproduced an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Independent</EMPHASIS> in the UK which described one scene of the game as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an enemy is punched off a ledge and impaled on a sharp spike&mdash;the player has the option of electrocuting the opponent and then either ripping out the still beating heart or tearing off the head and holding it aloft with spinal cord still dangling!</PARA>
<PARA>I trust the House will tolerate my explicit recitation of that monstrous game called Mortal Kombat, but it is very necessary to illustrate the potentially dangerous effect on children. That decision whether to electrocute or dismember the opponent has to be made by the player. This decision could be made by someone who is as young as nine, 10 or 11 years of age. The worst part of this obscenity is that the game is at present, and has been for some time, readily available in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my strong view, and, I believe, the very strong view of the general community, that these sorts of games should not be available in Australia. We already know that the media, television in particular, has a very powerful influence on young people. In fact, it is somewhat trite to make that comment because previous members, particularly the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), have cited numerous studies which draw the link between violence on television or videos and an individual's behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have to be completely oblivious to what is going on around us if we did not recognise, from our own experiences and our own readings, the link between the obscene and violent material available publicly and the effect it has on people. I say `people' because it is not just young children who are susceptible to this material; it is also adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine for a moment a 10- or 11-year-old watching Mortal Kombat. Although there is perhaps no empirical evidence that would satisfy everybody, you would have to believe in your own mind that that child must grow up with a lesser value for human life than he or she should. Nothing, no pop psychology or psychologist beating a different drum, will convince me that it will not have some effect on a child. Heaven knows, I do not want to watch Mortal Kombat for fear that I, myself, would be desensitised in some way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not be distracted today by violence on television even though I believe this parliament has been played on a break by the networks. A couple of years ago, at the urging of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we raised the need to review the viewing times of violent movies on television. The networks made all the right noises and for a short while they shifted some of the violent movies on a Sunday night to 9.00 p.m. or 9.30 p.m., but when the clamour died down, sure enough, the worst of the violent movies were back to prime time viewing at 8.30 p.m. We cannot rely on the television networks in this country for self-regulation. As I say, we will save that for another day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House has to be resolute in these matters. Self-regulation is an ideal principle, particularly in industry, but when it comes to the communications sector I have very grave doubts that it will ever do anything except put the buck first and community sensitivities and responsibilities second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent South Australian education department submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in relation to violence in schools stated that a range of violent behaviour in schools is becoming more complex and varied, often influenced by film and video. There is a welter of evidence that children cannot cope with the images they see portrayed through media outlets, including, naturally, the issues before the House dealing specifically with computer games. The parliament and the government must then ensure that adequate protections are in place when it comes to accessibility of unsuitable videos and some computer games. As I said earlier, we have to think not only of today, but also of tomorrow. We must ensure that adequate restrictions are placed on the production and circulation of this material within Australia and we have to ensure that high penalties are in place for those who try to foist those games upon us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am therefore very disappointed and concerned that the contentious subject of bulletin boards is not included in this legislation. As I said earlier, I am sure we are going to be back here to deal with further advances in technology. I would hope that the bill, having been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies for further examination will deal with the issue of the need to control bulletin boards. The committee's report is due, I understand, on or around 10 October and will be very carefully considered, not just by the government but by all members of this parliament. This is an ongoing issue. The legislation makes a good, if somewhat tentative, start. But I am very glad to see the government starting to take the lead in this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill is an important piece of legislation for this House, our children and our society. I commend the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), for his stance on this bill. It is essential that a bill which is important to our future has everyone's support. I would like to begin by reading an article written by Adrian McGregor in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 10 February 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was a crime which shocked a nation and violated an idyllic community. On November 27, 1987, Sian Kingi, 12, was abducted from near her Noosa home, raped and murdered. There were no witnesses, few clues. Yet two weeks later John Watts was jailed for life, damned by the testimony of his wife Valmae Beck, herself imprisoned for her willing acquiescence.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sian Kingi, 12, emerged from a hot bread shop at Noosa Junction, told her mother, with whom she had been shopping, she would see her at home and rode off on her bike.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Home was only a kilometre away. Sian's mother, Lynda, walked across nearby Pinaroo Park, Shan rode around, flying on her prized possession, her 10 speed, yellow, girl's Repco racing bike.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her other prized possession, her long, straight, blonde hair streamed out behind. She rode out of sight and with every pedal a thread linking her to her mother stretched, thinner and thinner, until abruptly it snapped.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In their white, 1973 HQ Holden station wagon parked in a bay on the perimeter of the park sat Barrie John Watts and Valmae Fay Beck, an ill matched couple from Western Australia who had recently arrived in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They had been driving around Noosa Heads, Sunshine Beach and Tewantin all afternoon seeking the object of Watts's obsession&mdash;any pretty young schoolgirl, no more than thirteen, flat chested, didn't matter about the hair colour. But she had to be a virgin who Watts intended to rape.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every time he saw a potential victim, she was with friends or parents, or passersby would happen along. Beck was tiring of the wait. They had parked for 15 minutes when Watts suddenly whispered to Beck, "There's a girl coming on a bike. Stop her. Talk to her."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sian filled Watts's fantasies. Exceptionally pretty, blue eyed, tanned skin. Though only aged 12, Sian was already 167 centimetres tall. She was gentle, charmingly shy and very popular, with a brilliant smile which lit a pixieish quality in her personality. She liked sport. She was a true daughter of sunny, carefree, friendly Noosa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beck called out to Sian asking if she had seen a little white poodle with a pink bow. Sian slowed and stopped. No she hadn't. Beck continued to attract Sian's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Watts crept up behind, slammed a cloth over Sian's mouth and dragged her with him onto the back seat of the station wagon. Sian's screams were muffled. Beck's blue healer, Rajah, leapt out, excited, barking. Sian's bike fell over. Beck frantically fetched the dog, stood the bike up, jumped in the driver's seat and sped off.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It took perhaps thirty seconds and was so brazen that one glance from a witness would have saved Sian. People in a service station 150 metres away. Had they been looking, they might have seen. Passing cars, just 50 metres off had full view.</PARA>
<PARA>I use this terrible case to provide background to the legislation which we have before us today. Now that honourable members have heard some of the facts of the case I will draw to the attention of this House some of the things that motivated that awful act. Adrian McGregor addresses them in his article, when he states that Barrie Watts and his wife:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . argued, principally over Watts's fantasies about schoolgirls. He told her that if she valued their marriage, if she loved him, she would help him get rid of his aggression.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He told her that once he had sex with someone for the first and only time&mdash;a virgin&mdash;he would never look at another woman in his life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In early October 1987, they drove to Queensland, via Melbourne, and rented a house in Lowood, a small farming town 50 kilometres west of Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the crux of the matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Watts had a bent for pornographic videos mostly to do with teenage prostitutes.</PARA>
<PARA>The availability of this material to Watts caused, motivated and stimulated him to act out his sick fantasies on a poor, unsuspecting, innocent child whom he raped and murdered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating will, in cooperation with the states and territories, form the basis of a uniform approach Australia-wide to the classification of publications, films and computer games. Whilst it may not prevent the availability of the type of material outlined in the bill, it will make sure that it is regulated to a certain category and treated in a uniform manner across the nation. There have certainly been examples of materials slipping from category to category between the states. This legislation will prevent that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently a number of difficulties in dealing with the nation's censorship laws. They are far too complicated and totally lack uniformity. This bill is a result of a report from the Australian Law Reform Commission. It was asked to provide information on how classification laws could be simplified and given greater efficiencies whilst still maintaining the cooperative nature of the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major provision of this bill is that it sets up the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. It also spells out the procedure that is to be adopted for the classification of publications, films and computer games. This board will determine the classifications in accordance with the national classification code and guidelines. All of this must be agreed between the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will be fruitless without the cooperation of the states and territories. Complementary legislation must be enacted in each state and territory parliament for the provisions of this bill to work. From what I have heard this morning, I hope that my colleagues opposite will go to their colleagues in the states and territories and ask for an assurance that they will comply. We need bipartisan cooperation on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important aspects of this legislation is that it provides for compulsory classification of computer games, which we have heard quite a lot about today. Computer games will be treated for classification purposes just as films and publications will. This is very important as some video games are moving into the realms of explicit pornography and very worrying levels of violence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased, in the amendments to this bill, that the Classification Board will be empowered to act on material available on a telecommunications network. This will mean that the 0055 telephone service will be correctly regulated. The Classification Board will be able to provide advice in response to complaints about this material. I have personally had a number of complaints from my constituents about the 0055 service. The service is questionable because the material is loaded with sexual innuendo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Classification Board will now provide an avenue for complaint and regulation. One worried mother in my electorate brought me no less than 26 or 27 0055 numbers. I took the opportunity to call one of those numbers to check it out. We have to consider the innuendo involved in the material. It should not be available to anyone who can pick up a telephone. We have to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a good bill. It is a commonsense bill which will finally do away with the complicated and difficult to regulate system which now exists. Make no mistake: we have a duty to classify all material of this nature. To illustrate this point, I would like to quote from an article by Louise Robson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 22 August 1994. The articles states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Melbourne: Almost all classes contained a child whose combination of anti-social tendencies and the taste for violent entertainment made them a possible risk to society, a conference on effects of electronic media was told yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">La Trobe University Professor of clinical psychology Margot Prior said that more than 1000 research papers had clearly shown links between television violence and aggressive behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Prior said research showed watching violent media in combination with existing aggressive and anti-social tendencies produced high levels of violence in childhood and adult life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings were also true for movies, video and computer games and Internet, a computer bulletin board network through which children could gain access to violent and pornographic material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`A vivid example was seen just last year in the case of the murder of the Bulger child in Britain by two 11 year olds,' she said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Toddler James Bulger was lured to his death by two boys found to have been influenced by a horror movie.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`A history of problem behaviour along with some influence of violent video watching were influential in creating a situation in which these very high risk children could go on to engage in such horrific behaviour,' she said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Prior warned of many more potential aggressors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`I want you to know that there are numerous children in our society who have these at risk characteristics. Perhaps one or more in any classroom,' she said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A typical at risk child had aggressive parents who used harsh and inconsistent punishments. The parents applauded media violence but paid little attention to their children and failed to nurture them or encourage learning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These vulnerable children were rejected by their peers because of their anti-social behaviour and were driven away into more anti-social pastimes and more TV watching.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Prior went on to call for laws in the public interest to tighten controls over the availability of material. I believe that we consider some of those laws today. Bear in mind that the burden for this is not solely a legislative or government one. Professor Prior called for TV networks to program responsibly. This must occur. There is also a burden on parents and society to regulate access to this sort of material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, and during this year, I was involved in the report by the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on violence in schools. It was a very concise report. It has been well received in my community, and I hear that is the case in other communities. One of the areas that we looked at was how violence in schools might be affected by media and entertainment industries. I want to quote some of the findings and information that we received during that report. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The influence exerted on children by the media and the entertainment industry in general, was overwhelmingly identified in evidence as a contributor to the acceptance of, and use of, violence by children.</PARA>

<PARA>this is what is astounding&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">he or she would have seen some eighteen thousand murders on television. They referred to three thousand studies which identified a connection between the impact of media violence and the instigation of later violence.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an indictment of our society&mdash;18,000 murders witnessed before a child is 16 years of age. Where are we going to? The report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear view expressed to the Committee from a broad spectrum of submissions was that un-monitored television and video viewing&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `unmonitored'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was commonplace and had the effect of desensitising our children . . . The behaviour was reinforced when children dressed up and/or pretended to be their special hero, such as Batman, a Mutant Ninja Turtle or G.I. Joe. Teachers in particular identified the effect of programs which justified violence and portrayed demeaning attitudes as clearly identifiable in schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, teachers referred to changed playground behaviours, such as kicking and punching by primary pupils, which coincided with the televising of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a prime example of that behaviour in my own family. After viewing that particular program, my two nephews were extremely aggressive in their behaviour towards each other and their friends in their younger years. These programs have to have some effect on what happens to our society. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little dismayed that the government has been somewhat short-sighted in regard to the real need to control violent and sexually explicit material within the community. I suppose that, in a sense, it has been in danger of being left behind due to the inadequacy of the clause in the bill dealing with computer games and images. That is likely to change when the parliamentary secretary deals with that matter in a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is flawed in a number of other ways. Firstly, the bill in its current form cannot be used until the states and territories enact complementary legislation. I understand that there are indications of some concern from the states of Western Australia and Tasmania in relation to their position on some of the classifications. The bill specifically embodies an opt-out clause for states and territories which enact legislation and later decide that it does not meet their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a certain extent, I suppose there is a Claytons aspect to the bill. It is designed to give the impression that the government is going to do something about the problems associated with sexually explicit and violent material in this country. Possibly, as a result of that particular provision, it may not be able to achieve what it is setting out to do. I urge that there should be more lengthy consultations with the states which have indicated concerns with the classifications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the definitions contained in the bill are woefully inadequate to provide any real protection. As we have already heard, as far as computer games software is concerned, the bill's definitions fail to acknowledge the possibility that such a game, unlike a book or a slide show, may well contain audible material on the soundtrack which could be deemed pornographic or in other ways offensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation specifically refers to computer games. If you stretch the definitions included in the bill, child pornography could be seen as a publication of some kind. The bill classifies `publications' as any written or pictorial matter but does not include a film, computer game or advertisement for a publication, film or computer game. So a single pornographic picture may come under this definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Computer games are moving pictures often accompanied by sound effects. As I have said, nowhere in the definitions of the bill is the soundtrack of a video game mentioned&mdash;unless the parliamentary secretary can satisfy me as to that. It would be possible then, within the confines of this bill, to produce a game with acceptable graphic images but which contains profanity of the worst possible kind and have it classified purely on the basis of the definitions provided. This point in itself is reason enough to send the bill away for redrafting. It could be argued that the use of obscene language in the context of a computer game is as unacceptable as actual physical depictions of cruelty, very gross sexual behaviour, sexism and pornography. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the bill, until the indication of the circulated amendments, will prove useless as a tool of classification with regard to many computer games that would otherwise be refused classification and, subsequently, sales. The bill however is based on the presumption that the authors of works, in this case computer games and/or pornographic material, will voluntarily submit them for classification because of their desire to sell them within Australia. That seems like a reasonable way of approaching business but the presumption that items, games and the like are always produced for sale and profit in the new age of computers is as old fashioned as some of the clocks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). It does not hold for a great and increasing number of authors of computer games in this country and around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak shortly about the danger this bill poses as regards accessing unsuitable material by our children through the rapidly growing information superhighway. Firstly, let me inform members that there is a growing tendency for software authors to produce programs and games that require no payment. This type of product has already been classified without the government's help. It is called `freeware' and, occasionally, `shareware' or even `crippleware'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these cases, the authors are not driven by the dollar; they do it for the experience, to prove they can do it and often just for the sheer delight they can cause through the effects of their programs. Often the author is just exhibiting his largess by giving away the fruits of his hard work at the computer keyboard. Often the finished product just is not worth the trouble of pushing it in a very competitive market and, occasionally, it stems from the same philosophy which brought us computer viruses and graffiti vandalism. More importantly, there is a trend to authors of simply placing the item in a public place for use by anyone without his or her name being associated with the product simply, as Sir Edmund Hillary is quoted as having said of climbing Mount Everest, `because it was there'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address this issue in more detail in a moment. It is a problem which effectively renders this legislation useless in controlling the distribution of a huge proportion of computer games and other suspect software in this country. Because of this, the bill should be sent to the appropriate committee where it can be examined and given some more teeth. Despite the softness of the bill, however, I have concerns about the legislation if passed as it is now particularly, as I have indicated, where it applies to the area of computer and video games. These are areas of the publishing industry which are set to explode in number and variety over the next few years, and certainly in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a society, we have had enough experience by now to know where to draw the line regarding the issues of pornography and violence in relation to books and other hard publications. As far as films are concerned, there is a system in place which offers scrutiny and effective censorship in some areas in the public interest. Occasionally the censor gets it wrong, like in the situation regarding the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>, which was reclassified with an R rating on appeal after being refused classification on its release in 1984. This was a film of such depravity and debauchery that it is difficult to imagine the depiction of its litany of inhuman acts of violence and degradation. The film should have been completely banned in this country. The fact that such a film is available for viewing under any circumstances is a reflection of the inadequacies of the current classification system. But that is another matter entirely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the film was the subject of some scrutiny and comment. It was a physical item which could be viewed by a group of people charged with protecting the community from that type of material. If it had been a computer game it could have been, and will continue to be, distributed quite effectively without ever having been subjected to that sort of scrutiny. Here is the nub of the problem as far as computer games are concerned. More often than not young people use computer games and other computer software unsupervised. Access to information by children and other persons via computers is increasing in scope and variety at a rate which is of concern. It is a meteoric rate of increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, this is the information superhighway: a highway on which our children can play but which is no less a dangerous place than, in some instances, a physical bitumen roadway teeming with loaded vehicles. What parent would leave an unattended child in the middle of the Hume Highway on a Saturday afternoon? But more and more parents feel safe to leave their charges in front of a computer screen, behind which are information and images that could damage them in ways far more seriously than a traffic accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear a lot about this information superhighway these days but very few of us get to ride on it. Mostly we are content to take the benefits it brings without realising that with those benefits also come many dangers. Like technology generally, to many of us this `cyberspace', as it is called by many young computer enthusiasts, is a mystery because it is not immediately visible like a book or a photograph. Even video games while they are not being used are inert uninteresting objects, just data on a storage device. But the information superhighway has the potential to make a mockery of ill-considered bills like the one before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government misses the boat on this one, all manner of material, desirable and undesirable, will flood into this country without any effective controls. It is precisely because of the government's inability to really foresee any of the problems which will be created in a few years by the burgeoning of electronic networking that I am less enthusiastic of its ability to control or combat the threat when it arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if my concerns for what may happen in the future do not move me to oppose this bill in its present form, the bill as presented is flawed in several areas, which would make it less effective and less useful. It is time the government looked deeper and sent this bill to the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies for a complete overhaul to ensure that it addresses the problems which may arise. This may not be a simple task either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information superhighway is not only invisible to the government to a certain extent but also unseen by many Australians. Many members of this place may not even be aware what the term `information superhighway' means. In the next couple of minutes I will indulge them. The electronic superhighway is the increasing web of technology which allows computers, television, telephone and all manners of electronic communications to link up across the world and give access to information and other data instantly at ridiculously low costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of leaping in with a knee-jerk bill like this one, the government should take the opportunity to embark upon a detailed scrutiny of the potential that the unseen web of electronic telecommunications connections will soon weave in our society. There is a view that the information superhighway needs some policing. With that type of scrutiny or oversight, the information networks can potentially provide enormous benefits for our community, but abuse of the systems may cause disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, President Clinton has indicated that he supports all Americans having access to the information superhighway by the year 2000 through schools, libraries, hospitals and clinics across the country. Several states in the United States have indicated some concern at the speed of these changes. In fact, the National Conference of State Legislatures adopted a policy at its 1993 annual general meeting that stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since states share regulatory responsibilities with the federal government, a co-operative approach is necessary . . . the federal government must recognise that states have unique priorities that require state and regional specific solutions.</PARA>
<PARA>While much of the problems perceived by the American states were connected with the cost of telephone services, local competition and infrastructure standardisation, the important point to be made here is that the American government has clearly identified the information superhighway as important and that it must be regulated to a certain extent to be of most benefit to its citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By comparison, the Australian government seems to ignore the growing inevitability of the problem, although, as I have indicated, there are some changes; I have already given the parliamentary secretary the benefit of praise for those changes. The government somewhat tries to pretend that the webs of this type of interconnectivity are not growing at the rate at which they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the Aarnet, which is this country's door to the global Internet service, currently links 110,000 computers to other users around the world. Traffic volumes grew by a staggering 130 per cent in 1993 alone. By 1996 it is estimated that more than 450,000 users will be regularly accessing the Internet system. Anyone with a computer and a modem can access the Internet&mdash;man, woman or child, regardless of age, race or religion. To the computer, all operators are equal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Though this may sound like some form of egalitarianism, it has with it some inherent problems. Children, for instance, are treated no differently from other users and can have access to the same files, data, images and games as their adult co-users. Often the children, having grown up in the computer age, are able to far outstrip their parents and other peers in their ability to be able to navigate through the information superhighway. As I have already indicated, in many cases, parents are content to leave their children to their own devices on computer networks and bulletin boards in the belief that the inert computer and the fact that the children are generally quiet and well behaved will do them more good than harm. As I indicated earlier, that may well not be the case. Computers can be powerful tools when used as teaching aides or when used to spark a child's imagination but, as baby-sitters, they display some particularly schizophrenic features. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, lest anyone form the impression that I am forming a case against Internet or any similar computer network, I make it quite clear that I am talking here about the unknown&mdash;something that none of us are in a position to really be able to quantify or estimate accurately. Much of what goes on in Internet is uncontrolled. This is the very essence of the attraction of accessing networks like Internet. In the `net', as it is called, there is a certain freedom from observation provided, in the main, by anonymity. The Internet is not the only place where this freedom can be found. The Internet is not the only system of network communications that can be accessed by children and adults. There are more than 200 registered private bulletin boards in Australia and many times that number which do not register their operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Australia's first arrest was made of a computer systems operator using his equipment to distribute child pornography. Last year, an interdepartmental inquiry was set up by the Attorney-General's Department to look into the use of computer bulletin boards by paedophile networks in this country. As a member of the Joint Statutory Committee on the National Crime Authority, I have proposed an inquiry into the extent and the way in which paedophile networks are infiltrating and spreading across this country. To date the minister has refused to release the findings of the interdepartmental inquiry. If this legislation is similar to some of the other types of responses we have had on this important issue, the question of commitment becomes an important one and the subject of some concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving aside the question of how this government&mdash;any government&mdash;can effectively police the type of exchange on the Internet, there is the question of the profusion of private bulletin boards across the world. Like the Internet, this private system can be accessed by anyone with a computer and a modem. Unlike the `net', however, these bulletin boards have little or no surveillance or control on what is placed on them and what can be removed; they are almost completely autonomous. Anyone could set one up and distribute the appropriate telephone numbers, giving users access to any files, messages, games and other data which the operator cares to put forward for public consumption. To be fair, many bulletin boards in this country are run by scrupulously honest and attentive people who ensure that copyright and/or pornographic material that may be uploaded by a user never makes it to an area where it could be retrieved by children or people with less than honourable intentions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worrying that many others embody the philosophy of the computer `hacker'. `Hackers', for those members who may not know of them, are computer users who revel in some of the extra freedoms that I have alluded to. They do not accept society's rules. In the fluid thing that is cyberspace, they find an environment which does not require them to adhere to society's wishes. To control these types of elements in society will be an enormous challenge in future years for the government of this country&mdash;to be able to achieve the very delicate balance between individual freedom and the interests of protecting people like minors, children and others, from the sort of offensive, sexually explicit or violent material that can be distributed through that medium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was going to point out that it was time for the government to address this situation. I now find, of course, that it has done so. It is good to see that those amendments have come about. They have come about partly as a response to some of the concern that has been raised publicly about the effectiveness of the legislation. Under clause 5 in the definitions of the bill&mdash;line 5 of page 3, paragraph (a)&mdash;a bulletin board is omitted from any definition of computer game. I understand that now a computer bulletin board will not be excluded from the scope of the act. I see the parliamentary secretary nodding. In other words, a computer bulletin board will now be drawn within the scope of the legislation. That is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other `products' on the information superhighway which are worrying. How many members, for instance, have heard of computer demos? A demo is not a computer game; it is not a static picture either. As far as I can tell, the definition in this bill does not cover it. No input is required from the user. It could not be referred to as an advertisement for a book, film or computer game. Therefore, while it is not a book, film or game, a demo could be circulated without restriction. A demo is a computer program which, once started, shows off the coding or programming skills of its creator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These demos are often wondrously colourful and interesting with breathtaking computer generated effects&mdash;such as movement, three-dimensional images and words. The images are often accompanied by involved soundtracks. You do not actually have to use a demo. It is just there to look at, to listen to and, in some instances, to be amazed by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these demos push the limits of taste and sensibility. A member of my staff has informed me that, on one occasion, he was able to download from a bulletin board a highly pornographic disk, which contained a throbbing soundtrack based on a then popular song, accompanied by digitised images of nudity and oral sex. That was out there on the open information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a fact. Any child with access to the appropriate computer equipment could have got hold of this type of material and viewed it. The item itself would almost certainly not have been considered as the subject of the classification guidelines and definitions, as outlined in this bill&mdash;unless the parliamentary secretary can convince me otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that members concede that this bill does not even begin to address that issue. No doubt, if this bill is passed, we will all be called back to this place to debate other amendments as the bill proves to be less effective than the task it set out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there are a number of matters of concern in the bill&mdash;notwithstanding the amendments that are to be proposed by the parliamentary secretary and which have already been circulated. I reiterate that some issues of the computer or information superhighway, networks and bulletin boards still need to be looked at more thoroughly. It would be good for the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to release the findings of his departmental group in relation to the issue of networks, bulletin boards and paedophile networks. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill. The classification of publications, films and computer games, as conveyed in this bill, is vitally important to the moral fibre of our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say at the outset that I am not one who leaps onto the bandwagon of censorship. In a free society, censorship is something to be avoided at all costs. However, I do not believe that there can be any dispute with the proposition that there should be classification of all of these activities so that people who are confronted with the possibility of using, hiring or buying them know exactly what they are getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly pleasing that the states and  territories have agreed to this bill. That shows an increasing maturity in Australia's federalism. We need to have many more examples of the states, the territories and the Commonwealth acting together in concert in areas where we need to have a similar, if not an exact, legal system for particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does not mean there is not some benefit in having separate streams of development in other areas. Many times state and territory governments have to go their own ways. This legislation is a great step forward because there is absolutely no doubt that Australia's censorship laws have been in a totally unsatisfactory state. The current laws are totally and far too unnecessarily complicated; they are not uniform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very appropriate for the Australian Law Reform Commission to be asked to report on how those laws could be simplified. The commission presented its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Censorship procedure</EMPHASIS> in 1991. It is now 1994. I suppose a degree of criticism could be levelled at the length of time that the report has taken. Nonetheless, I think it would be unkind to embark on that criticism. It is very pleasing that this bill, after consultation with the states and territories and following the recommendations in the Australian Law Reform Commission's report, is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and sets out the procedures for classification. An essential priority is that there should be a review board as well. Once the national classification code and guidelines have been completely established, classification decisions will be made in accordance with those guidelines. The commission in its report noted that there:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . will be a single procedure, avoiding the overlaps and duplications that presently exist, and the classifiers will derive their powers from a single source, removing the difficulty that they sometimes face now of conflicting legislation from different jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally agree with what the Attorney-General (Mr lavarch) said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will only apply by its own force in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and the extent to which classification decisions under it have effect in other jurisdictions is a matter entirely for the State or Territory concerned;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the States and Territories have equal voting rights in settling the criteria and guidelines under which classification decisions are made;</PARA>
<PARA>That is the way it should be. There is still the let-out provision for the states and territories. If they do not agree to adopt the same classifications, they can legislate the classifications which will apply in their areas of jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having started by saying that I am opposed to censorship, I reiterate and reinforce that I am totally in support of the classification provisions put forward in this bill. Adults should be able to read, hear and see whatever they like. Equally, as a foundation of my belief of the way that censorship laws should apply, children should be protected from any material that is likely to do them any harm or to disturb them. I believe that all Australians should be protected from unsolicited material of a sexual or violent nature. The bill takes account of community concerns about video activities or whatever which either accept or try to incite people to violence, particularly sexual violence; it is totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain people do use the classification system. I have spoken to quite a large number of people about this. If you go into any video shop around Australia, you will see people making choices on the basis of the classification of the video. I am very happy indeed that there will be a strengthened form of classification so that there will be little opportunity for kids to get hold of and see material they should not see which their parents have taken out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depiction of violence on television, I believe without any doubt, has an impact on some&mdash;but not all&mdash;people. We are fed a stream of violence in our television news. I, for one, object to the gratuitous depiction of bloodstains on footpaths and things of this nature. It is totally unnecessary. It adds nothing to the story. It just satisfies some form of&mdash;dare I say&mdash;bloodthirstiness on the part of the people in the television stations and networks. I do not think we should be pandering to anybody's desire to see pools of blood on the road. I think it is totally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been told when talking to people around Australia that a great many people&mdash;perhaps people who are unemployed, unfortunately&mdash;are becoming TV or video addicts, seeing up to five videos a day. In a free society, if people want to, they should be able to do that. This is an area where the administration of this bill could have some worthwhile activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the important thing about Australian classification and censorship laws is that adults should be able to make their own decisions without big brother government telling them what to do. The classifications and the content of that material should be clearly stated so that nobody can be inadvertently exposed to something they do not want to see. The indicator of a civilised society is how it treats its children. I hope this bill will ensure the rights of children not to be exposed to violence and all sorts of perversities. The protection of children should continue to be strengthened. We should be protecting our children at all times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. The bill originated in report No. 55 in 1991 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Censorship procedure</EMPHASIS> of the Australian Law Reform Commission. In the report the commission recommended that the current state by state legislation dealing with the classification of films and publications be rationalised into a national legislative scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national scheme was to consist of a federal act establishing the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and it was to set out procedures for classifying films and publications. There was to be attached to the act a code containing the criteria for classification. It was envisaged that the code would be agreed to by the Commonwealth, states and the Northern Territory. Finally, the national scheme was to be completed by state and territory laws adopting the classifications made under the federal act and restricting the dissemination of films and publications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law Reform Commission recommended that the states and territories retain their existing responsibilities for regulating the dissemination of classified material. The bill, to this extent, adopts the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission and does not purport to do more than provide for the classification of material within its purview. It does not regulate the exhibition, sale or advertising of classified material. I will return to this point later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between the delivery of the Law Reform Commission report and the introduction of this bill, the issue of the classification and distribution of video games and computer games came to some prominence. Excessively violent computer programs became available for use in the form of computer games. Programs containing material that is sexually explicit, pornographic and demeaning to women also became a feature of some computer game programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These computer games and the technology for getting access to them&mdash;for example, over telephone lines&mdash;have become readily available to children. In many cases children are so adept at using computers and computer technology, and their parents are not, that their exposure to unsuitable material is not screened by the protection of parental control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond computer games, there is the issue of so-called bulletin boards. Anyone with a home computer and telephone modem in Australia, with the appropriate inexpensive equipment, can have access through a bulletin board to material from all over the world. Bulletin boards have been used to spread extremely offensive and often illegal material, such as child pornography or defamatory information. This material flows in unobstructed by any form of censorship. There is an urgent need to address this problem, and I will return to it later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies looked at the issue of computer games in 1993. In its report handed down in October 1993 the Senate committee recommended a scale of classifications for video games. The classifications ranged from G for general, through G-8 for games suitable for children over eight years, to M for games suitable for persons over 15 years. The Senate committee also recommended that an MA classification be introduced for computer games that should not be sold or hired to persons under 15 years unless they were accompanied by an adult. The Senate committee further recommended that amusement arcades operating coin operated games should be restricted to offering the G and G-8 categories only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that the bill does not purport to legislate for control of classified material. It therefore does not deal with this recommendation of the committee. As a result, computer games that are classified as unsuitable for viewing by a person below the age of 15 years unaccompanied by an adult, or below the age of eight years, will be excluded from amusement arcades only if state and territory legislation imposes such controls. The bill therefore leaves a heavy burden of responsibility to the individual states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee also recommended that a community committee be included in the classification scheme. The Senate committee in its report envisaged the formation of a committee of community representatives including parents, teachers, church groups, academics, women, youth, and Aboriginal and ethnic representatives. The community committee was to have input in the decisions of the classification board and the review board. This contribution would be particularly useful, for example, where the review board varied a decision of the board to refuse to release a film or computer game. There is no reason why this should not extend to publications also. The bill has not adopted this recommendation. The community has a vital and direct concern in matters of censorship. This is an appropriate matter for direct participation by the community in making classification decisions. For my part, I would urge the government to reconsider and to amend the legislation accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When enacted, the bill will not be able to be brought into effect as a national scheme until complementary state and territory legislation is enacted. The state and territory legislation will also have an opting out provision which allows the state to classify material separately from the Commonwealth. This means that the one piece of material could have different classifications around Australia. The effect of this is to detract from the notion of a truly national scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reference to the issue of computer bulletin boards, I have had the benefit of seeing the amendment proposed to be moved by the government. This amendment removes the exclusion of bulletin boards from the definition of computer games and therefore means that the provisions in the bill relating to classification of computer games will apply to bulletin boards. There are still no specific provisions dealing with bulletin boards. Due to the specialised and unusual nature of bulletin boards as a form of electronically supplied information, there is a need for specific provisions. I urge the government to deal more closely with the matter of bulletin boards before this bill is passed in order to avoid the need for future amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of computer games is also deficient in that it does not include the soundtrack to a computer game. This could allow a visually innocuous computer game with an obscene and explicit soundtrack or verbal commentary to be classified G. This also should be dealt with before the bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national classification code is in the schedule to the bill. It is not clear whether the code comprises only the principles set out at the beginning of the schedule to the bill, or whether it also comprises the table set out in the schedule. This should be clarified in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment of the code is to be done by the Attorney-General reaching agreement with the censorship ministers of the relevant states. The bill does not require the amendments to be tabled in parliament, nor is there an opportunity for them to be disallowed. This method of amendment of what is an important part of the proposed classification scheme is an inappropriate delegation of the Commonwealth's legislative power. The exercise of legislative power is not sufficiently exposed to the scrutiny of the parliament by the process proposed by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is made mandatory by clause 9 of the bill for the classification board to make classifications in accordance with classification guidelines. However, clause 12, which provides for the Attorney-General and the censorship ministers of the relevant states to make classification guidelines, is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory terms. The `may' should be changed to `shall'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 27 provides that a classification decision of the board takes effect on the day on which notice of the decision is given to the applicant under clause 25 of the bill. However, clause 25 does not make it clear when notice is `given' or deemed to be given. Clause 25 merely says that the board and the review board must give written notice of the decision to an applicant or to a person having an interest in the classification decision&mdash;for example, the publisher. The notice must be given as soon as practicable and, in any event, within 30 days of the decision. A copy of the classification certificate is sufficient notice. The question that then arises is whether notice is given for the purposes of clause 25 only when it is received by the addressee of the notice. This should be cleared up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up, I simply want to compliment each and every one of the speakers who has spoken in the parliament on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994. As this is a broadcast day, I might say that very often the media have it that the parliament is an exercise in cut and thrust in which very little cooperation takes place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That agreement has arisen from the fact that the processes involved in dealing with this matter started in the report of the Law Reform Commission in 1991.

I think that this indicates a good example of an area of legislation where, through the proper processes, a large measure of agreement has been reached.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>This bill introduces a range of important reforms in the social security portfolio, stemming primarily from the 1994 budget and the government's 1994 white paper on employment and growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has provided a valuable opportunity for a fundamental review of the income support system for unemployed people. The current system has been outpaced by social and labour market changes and the changing structure of employment&mdash;changes such as a higher incidence of long-term unemployment, greater participation by women in the work force, increasing part-time and casual work, and a decreasing gap between low wages and income support. The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. Further measures contained in the white paper will be included in social security legislation to be introduced later in these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes to commence in March 1995 will broaden the range of work related options that the long-term unemployed, and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, can pursue while continuing to receive income support. These options will include developing and participating in group or cooperative enterprises, more courses of study and training approved by the Commonwealth Employment Service, and a wider range of voluntary unpaid work such as on environmental projects or community and cultural activities. Also, eligible clients will be able to continue to receive income support for up to 12 months while developing self-employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further important reform is the introduction of two advance payment options for eligible jobsearch and newstart allowance clients. After three months on payment, clients will have access to an up-front lump sum payment of up to $500 to assist in jobsearch and other activities related to finding paid employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the long-term unemployed, and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, there is an option to take an advance of their income support of up to $1,000 for activities approved by their case manager as assisting their return to work and included in the client's jobsearch or newstart activity agreement. In either case, the proportion of payments to be advanced will be limited to 14 per cent of the rate of the allowance, not including remote area allowance. The period over which future payments may be advanced will be up to six months for the $500 option and 12 months for the $1,000 option. The remaining fortnightly payment will be paid in the usual way. There will be no interest charged and advances will be available only to clients who can show that they have the ability to manage their finances while taking up this option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for jobsearch or newstart allowance, a client must satisfy the secretary that he or she is taking reasonable steps to comply with the terms of a jobsearch or newstart activity agreement. It is also generally necessary to satisfy the activity test either by actively seeking and being willing to undertake paid work that is, in the secretary's opinion, suitable for the person or by taking reasonable steps to comply with a requirement to undertake certain activity. There have been broadly varying decisions made about what constitutes suitable work and what steps are reasonable. As a result, the application of the legislation has lacked uniformity and has caused confusion for clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill rectifies this inconsistency by codifying the suitable work and reasonable steps issues. In future, the emphasis will be altered to create a presumption that any paid work is suitable unless the secretary forms the opinion that it is unsuitable for the person. A range of circumstances will be prescribed to establish that the work is unsuitable, such as the client lacking the requisite skills, experience or qualifications for the job; the existence of a pre-existing illness or injury that would be aggravated by the conditions of work; and the wages of a job not covered by an existing award being below the minimum rate for comparable work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasonable steps issue will be addressed by a new provision that deems a client not to have taken reasonable steps to comply with the activity test or the terms of a jobsearch or newstart activity agreement. This will apply if the main reason for failing to comply involves a matter that is within the control of the client or if the circumstances which prevented the client from complying were reasonably foreseeable by the client. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes the jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance liquid assets test more equitable. This test is essentially a deferral of payment to a client whose liquid assets&mdash;that is, cash and readily realisable assets&mdash;exceed established thresholds. First, the liquid assets waiting period will apply to clients only once in any 12-month period instead of each time a claim is made. Secondly, allowance will be made for a client's liquid assets to be reduced by any one-off lump sum payment of non-housing related debts such as clearance of a car loan. Also, the proceeds of the sale of the client's home may be deducted as long as settlement occurred in the last 12 months and the money is to be used to buy another home. Lastly, avoidance of the liquid assets test will be prevented by having it apply to both the client and the client's partner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill relaxes the residence requirements for refugees applying for certain social security pensions. The qualification criteria for most pensions require a period of qualifying residence or a continuous period of being an Australian resident. As a result, refugees cannot qualify for most pension payments. It will now be possible for refugees to satisfy the residence requirements as long as they reside in Australia and hold a class of visa approved by the Minister for Social Security. Provided that other qualification criteria are satisfied, refugees will have access to Australian pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More equity is being introduced into the payment of additional family payment outside Australia. At present, additional family payment can continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks if the qualified person is absent from Australia, as long as the child remains in Australia with the other parent. The unintended effect of this on sole parents is that they lose additional family payment as soon as they leave Australia, because they have no partner in Australia to care for the child. In the case of a couple, it also precludes payment of additional family payment if both parents leave Australia. This restriction is being relaxed to allow for additional family payment to continue to be paid for up to 13 weeks to a qualified person who is outside Australia, whether or not the person has a partner who remains in Australia with the child. It will still be a requirement that the child remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill closes a loophole in the provisions that allow the value of certain employer provided fringe benefits to be taken into account under the family payment income test and the parental income test for jobsearch and sickness allowance recipients aged under 18. Some employees may be paid rental or mortgage subsidy payments that are not captured by the fringe benefit provisions in the Social Security Act because they are cash payments. Amendments are now being made that will result in these payments being treated as income for the relevant income tests, if the payments made by an employer to an employee are to assist the employee to meet costs associated with a housing loan or rental payments. However, this bill also includes special measures for Defence Force members so that low cost housing or a housing rental payment is given a lower fringe benefits value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act contains definitions that refer to certain sections in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 relating to the calculation of an undeducted purchase price&mdash;that is, a UPP. Amendments to these social security definitions are necessary in the light of recent amendments made to the calculation of UPPs under the tax act. They will ensure that there is not an unintended tightening of the income test treatment of pensions and annuities taken out on or after 1 July 1994; that is, the status quo will remain for social security purposes. This will be achieved by applying the pre-1 July 1994 income tax definition of UPP for social security purposes so that social security clients with superannuation investment products purchased with eligible termination payments will be treated the same irrespective of when they purchased these products. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY (NEW ZEALAND AGREEMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the incorporation into the Social Security Act 1991 of the new social security agreement that was signed by Australia and New Zealand on 19 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1943, Australia and New Zealand signed a `host country' social security agreement under which each country agreed to pay pensions to residents who had come from the other country. Reimbursement arrangements have gradually been introduced to ensure that the arrangement can withstand imbalances in migration patterns between the countries. During the latter part of the 1980s there was a significant net intake of New Zealanders into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new agreement takes account of the ease with which people may travel between Australia and New Zealand. It means that neither country will suddenly face an excessive burden in paying pensions to people who have spent most or all of their working lives in the other country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new agreement, New Zealand will reimburse Australia for pensions paid to people from New Zealand with less than 10 years residence in Australia during their working life. Australia will similarly reimburse New Zealand for the pensions it pays to people from Australia. The level of reimbursement in these cases will be based broadly on the percentage of a person's working life spent in each country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new agreement provides a far more equitable sharing of the cost of pensions paid to people who move between Australia and New Zealand. These new cost sharing arrangements are to begin from 1 January 1995, the date the new agreement comes into effect, and will cover all new arrivals from that date. The arrangements will be phased in over five years for people who arrived after 1 January 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reimbursements by New Zealand to Australia are likely to triple over the next three years and then rise to around $90 million a year as arrangements are phased in under the new agreement. The agreement does not cover reimbursement for benefits to the unemployed or family allowances. These benefits are not normally included in the scope of cost sharing agreements. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When it was suggested that the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994 and the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill 1994 be cognate, I indicated the opposition's reluctant concurrence with that course of action. One may wonder why we would be reluctant in relation to this matter, but it needs to be understood that originally these bills were to be one bill. The government sought the cooperation of the opposition and, presumably, of other, minor parties in relation to the handling of the matter and said that it wanted two bills. The reason it wants two bills is that it is a little uncertain as to what course may be adopted in another house in relation to the way in which the major bill&mdash;the budget and white paper amendment bill&mdash;might be dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned that there may be items contained in that which would require further detailed examination and referral to a parliamentary committee for elaboration. In seeking our cooperation, what it wants now is to have its cake and eat it too. It wants two bills but it does not want two debates. Of course, the cognate arrangement truncates the discussion. One may wonder why I am emphasising that when, ultimately, we will not oppose the legislation in either bill before the parliament. The fact is that each bill raises major issues. The budget and white paper bill, in particular, raises a whole host of issues, all different. Each of the eight or so different propositions that are involved in the legislation could require a debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal first with the Social Security (New Zealand Agreement) Amendment Bill. It is a relatively short bill that has annexed to it a new agreement with New Zealand. However, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) failed to detail some of the history of this matter, because that agreement had been in place for about 40 years. It was negotiated some time ago before migration patterns between Australia and New Zealand changed, such that many New Zealanders saw a virtue in retiring to Australia. Of course, if they do retire to Australia, under the existing agreement, their pensions are fully paid in Australia by the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides for a new arrangement in relation to reimbursement. The fact is that, under the existing arrangements, there is about a $500 million shortfall between the amount of money that we are paying to New Zealanders in Australia and the amount of money that is being paid to Australian pensioners retiring to New Zealand and other beneficiaries in New Zealand. This is a very significant shortfall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) flew off to New Zealand last year and said that he was going to do the right thing by Australia and renegotiate agreements to remove that disadvantage. He told us that he would at least be able to redress that shortfall substantially. If we look at the briefings that were given to the press in advance of the Prime Minister's visit&mdash;he was undertaking a little bully boy exercise to New Zealand&mdash;we will see that he expected to get back $70 million to $80 million per annum from that exercise. They are the amounts that were being reported in the news at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we got as a result of the efforts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin)? We now have an agreement which will be phased in over five years. In the first year it will recoup 15 per cent of pensions granted before 1 January 1995; in the second year, 40 per cent; in the third year, 60 per cent; and, in the fourth year, 80 per cent. After the fifth year there will be full reimbursement on the basis of certain calculations as to the proportion of time that people were in the work force in each country. Some benefits will be the subject of recoupment action and others will not, as explained by the parliamentary secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The savings, as outlined by the parliamentary secretary,  resulting from this exercise are estimated to be $2 million in the first year&mdash;what happened to the Prime Minister's $70 million to $80 million?&mdash;$16.7 million in the second year and $34.2 million in the third year. When you look at the outcome that is to be achieved, it means that the Prime Minister's assertions have been totally blown. I think the government ought to be held accountable when it builds up expectations in that way and then walks away from them in agreements of this sort. I think it demonstrates the paucity of the government's negotiation skills. It also demonstrates the extent to which it leaves Australia hostage to the advantage that other countries&mdash;in this case, New Zealand&mdash;have been able to obtain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also object very much to the way in which the minister, in particular, deals with this matter when he attempts to explain it to his constituents, the constituency being the members of the Australian community reliant upon income support through pensions and benefits. The Department of Social Security publishes a document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age Pension News</EMPHASIS>. The September 1994 copy has a banner headline which reads `New Zealand and Australian pension agreement signed'. The writer goes on to say that many pensioners, including age pensioners, who move from Australia to New Zealand and from New Zealand to Australia can be `assured of continuing support following a new agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an outrageous proposition to put: that, if this agreement had not been concluded, pensioners from New Zealand in Australia, and vice versa, would have been without support, and that the existing arrangements would have fallen to the ground! There is no cause to sow that sort of fear in the minds of the most vulnerable people in the Australian community and to hold yourself out to be a big fellow for having been able to negotiate an agreement which recoups a very small part of the shortfall that the Australian taxpayers have to make up at this time. This issue has been outrageously handled, and all because this country's Prime Minister wanted to make a few cheap points before he went on a trip to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the issue is all about in relation to this legislation. Sure, we do not oppose the agreement. It is the best the government could do. It gets a little more money for the Australian taxpayers, so we are not going to vote against it. But it ought to be understood that it is grossly below the government's own expectations, that it is grossly below the significant disadvantage that the Australian taxpayers now suffer and that it has been compounded by the outrageous proposition that the existing agreement was somehow going to fall to the ground if this new agreement were not negotiated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second bill we are to discuss is the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill 1994. This bill, again, is one in which the provisions, while they can be debated, will not be opposed by the opposition. Because I want to put clearly at issue the question of unemployment, which this bill is meant to deal with, I now move the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House is of the opinion that the Government should be condemned for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)its policies which have created record levels of unemployment;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)its inability to address the associated social inequity and hardship which has resulted; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)its failure to solve the ongoing unemployment crisis, in particular, the problem of long-term unemployment".</PARA>
<PARA>That amendment is seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). The issue needs to be debated every time we look at the measures the government puts in place which are designed to ameliorate the pain of the unemployment that it has created. Of course, the measures will be supported; but those who are culpable for producing the highest rates of unemployment that this country has seen since the last depression should remain accountable for them. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that sight is not lost of that issue, which is the major issue that needs to be addressed every time we look at these palliative measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first of three bills to be introduced in this session that give effect to measures announced in the 1994 budget and also in the white paper on employment and growth. Once again, the government having introduced an omnibus bill, we are debating eight separate measures. I want to make it clear that, when the bill introduces amendments which modify the liquid assets test waiting period applicable to jobsearch, newstart and sickness allowance recipients, that measure will not be opposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes a number of changes, some of which benefit the revenue. We will test the liquid assets of both partners in a relationship but, where people are in and out of unemployment, we will not liquid assets test them each time in a year that that might occur. Those reforms seem sensible enough to us and not of a controversial nature. They are designed to provide for a fair and more equitable system and, while one might want to talk about liquid assets issues in relation to unemployment, it seems to me that, in the context of the amendments that are before us, it is not appropriate to oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security said, relaxes the residential requirements for refugees to enable them to access certain social security payments. Currently the qualification provisions for social security benefits can vary between periods of five and 10 years, depending upon whether it is a pension or other forms of benefit. If people are continuously resident, they can access benefits. As a result of provisions of that sort, refugees&mdash;people that we have brought here because of their situation in relation to the international convention that requires them to have protection that cannot be provided elsewhere and who in most cases do not have families in a position here to support them and on whom they could rely&mdash;ought to be able to be granted benefits. They can in fact be granted benefits in certain circumstances, but we are of the view that it is inappropriate in relation to refugees&mdash;and we have always taken this position&mdash;that they should be disadvantaged in relation to being able to access, because of their refugee status, benefits that other Australians would be able to access. So, in a situation where a refugee resides in Australia, holds a visa which evidences that he or she has been granted refugee status and meets the residence criteria, in our view the amendment is one worthy of support. It takes into account the plight of refugees, and we do not oppose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also ensure that additional family payments will be made in certain circumstances, even if parents are temporarily absent overseas. It is interesting that the government is proposing an amendment in relation to this, because recently, when we proposed an amendment to another bill dealing with a like matter&mdash;accessing the home child-care allowance&mdash;the government was not so minded to adjust its legislation to take account of those people who might be overseas and who, if they were receiving the dependent spouse rebate, would have been able to access that benefit. However, the government saw fit to introduce provisions which emulated those that operate in relation to the family payments. Now it is going to ameliorate the harshness of that in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in my view, the government should look at this question generally, because people sometimes go overseas as aid workers, sometimes for the government, or in a policing role such as was recently announced in relation to Haiti. In each of these situations there needs, in my view, to be a basis upon which some accommodation can be made to continue support to the Australian families where their parents are carrying out a task which can sometimes be for the benefit of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will mean that, where children remain in Australia, the benefits will still be payable, after a 13-week period, to parents who might otherwise be required to be here. That, I think, is a measure that should not be opposed, but it ought to be judged against the lack of consistency by this government in relation to these matters, even when the problems have been clearly brought to its attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter relating to the closing off of loopholes in relation to accessing family payments. Recently the government, with our support, moved to close off loopholes in relation to fringe benefits which are paid in the nature of salary where they relate to housing benefits. The view was formed that if, when we were income testing people's eligibility for family payments, somebody had a fringe benefit in the nature of salary then that ought to be added to the salary and taken into account for the application of the test. That is a reasonable proposition. The government did not catch everything, because it said it wanted to deal only with the big payments. I assumed it had done the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find here? We find an amendment to now extend it to cover other forms of housing payments. So what is it telling us? The government is slipping through an amendment designed to remedy a significant defect&mdash;some might be generous and say it is an oversight, a mistake, an error&mdash;in legislation that was designed to address this question and which we dealt with a mere six months or so ago. Quite frankly, the government forgot to cover the cash payments that might cover housing costs. We will not be opposing the amendment, but government members need not think that when they make mistakes of that sort I will not draw attention to them. Other changes were made recently to the tax act, dealing with superannuation payments, and this bill brings the social security legislation into line. We will not oppose that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matters that I want to deal with are the measures for the amelioration of the hardship of unemployment, the major issue that I think ought to be debated in respect of this legislation. The amendments deal with compliance with activity tests and activity agreements, and we will not be opposing those measures. Enabling an advance payment of jobsearch and newstart allowances to be made in certain circumstances is a measure we will not be opposing, although one of my colleagues will be raising in the course of this debate the way in which the administrative arrangements might be applied in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to give people an advance of their benefits to enable them to buy a suit or to get some tools to undertake a job and it achieves its objective and they get a job, how are you going to recoup the money later on? You need to be sure of a reasonable prospect that these advances will be properly administered to prevent abuse and to ensure that the advance payments will be recouped if no further payments are to be made. We do not oppose the principle, but those administrative arrangements need to be addressed. One of my colleagues will be raising that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the new activities that will be available to jobsearch and newstart agreement clients are reasonable. In fact, I have advocated that course of action. The sort of activity that ought to be tested and available for people to choose should include voluntary work and training programs. You can go through the variety of activity that might be appropriate in proper cases beyond just mindlessly seeking employment opportunities where none exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these agreements between the unemployed and the government will be supported by us. But it is interesting that agreements, or contracts&mdash;that is what agreements are&mdash;are being negotiated with the most vulnerable people in the Australian community, the unemployed, when the legislation provides that you can be punished if you do not adhere to the contract. Yet this is the same government that tells us that in relation to less vulnerable people, those that are in employment, agreements of this sort are taboo and the government will have no part of them. So the government will trot them out for the unemployed but, for everybody else, it will largely ignore them. My colleague the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) will deal with these matters because I know he takes a personal interest in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that these amendments are merely bandaids for the problem that has been of the government's creation. That is what these amendments highlight. These amendments are designed to ameliorate the hardship that people suffer, but they do not solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of this debate I want to draw attention to a number of papers. There was a paper released recently by the Catholic bishops, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Putting people first: a word in support of the unemployed</EMPHASIS>. I think it is a very important paper. In chapter 4, `What can we do about unemployment?' the paper makes a number of points against certain principles and values. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any worthwhile unemployment policy should seek:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to help generate more jobs than might otherwise be available, and ideally, enough jobs to absorb all those experiencing involuntary unemployment . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.to try, through training and other means, to match the skills of the unemployed members of the workforce (and new entrants to the workforce) to the requirements of jobs likely to be available . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.meanwhile, to support (financially and otherwise) and offer comfort and counselling to those unable to find jobs . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It then makes a very simple point when it says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The White Paper&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">focuses heavily on the second and third of these objectives and many of the initiatives are to be commended. It is arguable, however, that the policy framework in place will not produce the forecast five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000. In any event, Australians should aim to regard such a level of unemployment as unacceptable. Justice demands that the aim should be to have no involuntary unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very simple statement, but what the church is telling us is that the white paper&mdash;that is, the government&mdash;does not have in place policies to generate more jobs than might otherwise be available. That is what the church is telling us. The paper does not go further and say the government should be condemned for that, but I think that is the course that should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that even the government's own advisers now tell it that that objective cannot be reached. I refer to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 13 September where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans, yesterday said it would be `extraordinarily difficult' for the Federal Government to achieve its goal of getting the unemployment rate down to 5 per cent by the end of the decade.</PARA>
<PARA>The report further stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Evans said Australia had not seen the necessary investment levels since the end of the 1980s. `We have not had continuous growth for a very long time' he said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`We need continuous growth over the decade if we are to get unemployment down . . .</PARA>
<PARA>It talked about getting unemployment down to that level which the government tells us is its objective. As honourable members know, this is a government that is seriously divided in relation to the way in which these matters are to be addressed. It cannot even get people to come into this chamber and participate in this debate. I notice only one government member is listed to follow me on this matter. I would like to know where the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) stands in relation to this debate, because I noticed that in the media he has had some things to say about unemployment. Of course, the member for Fraser, in the book that he has released, makes it very clear that the unemployment rate is likely to remain above the eight per cent level for the remainder of the century unless government policy is changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the government's own members are saying, but one could not get agreement in relation to it. I watched a debate last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> involving the former finance minister, Peter Walsh. Of course, he said the prescription of the member for Fraser was wrong. He said that the member for Fraser, who is advocating that we should increase taxes to deal with the situation, should not be followed. What I thought was particularly germane was that this man said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> last week that growth is the key and, as new alarm bells are sounding for deficits, he made it very clear that, while this government continues to oppose mining projects that are important for Australia's future in the way in which it does, it will not be able to address the employment question, the investment question or the deficit&mdash;the debt question. I think that was particularly poignant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Helen Hughes, a very eminent professor, indicated when she spoke here on the unemployment question that if we embark upon another period of recession&mdash;and they do seem to come round every so often&mdash;with unemployment levels at eight per cent, at the next recession we can expect them to be at 15 per cent. She was saying that the fundamental changes need to be made now in a period of recovery or growth, and that if you do not get it right you are storing up hardship for the future, hardship for our children's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was also saying that you have to look at the United States&mdash;the government does not like to hear that because that means you might have to have a more flexible labour market&mdash;and you need to look at the way in which it gets investment and uses investment. In America the machines wear out because they are often run 24 hours a day. We invest in new plant and equipment that remains as new because it is hardly ever used. It is interesting, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the Asian tigers that roar and manage their economies effectively to give low levels of unemployment. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 7 September we saw a report on the world competitive indexes. That report showed that it was not some low labor cost Asian country that was winning&mdash;although those countries were doing pretty well&mdash;nor the low cost ones such as Japan and Singapore; it was the United States of America that headed the list. And where was Australia? Australia was 15th. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us that it knows and understands that fundamental reforms of the sort that were outlined in our paper The Things That Matter are essential.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this cognate debate I wish to make some comment on the Social Security (1994 Budget and White Paper) Amendment Bill. The effect of that bill is to implement in part some of the measures adopted by the government in the recent Working Nation statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commence by quoting some of the points made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) in her second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a range of important reforms in the social security portfolio, stemming primarily from the 1994 budget and the government's 1994 white paper on employment and growth.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, of course, the Working Nation statement. The parliamentary secretary went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has provided a valuable opportunity for a fundamental review of the income support system for unemployed people. The current system has been outpaced by social and labour market changes and the changing structure of employment&mdash;changes such as a higher incidence of long-term unemployment, greater participation by women in the workforce, increasing part-time and casual work, and a decreasing gap between low wages and income support. The income support changes made in this bill are among those that will make the unemployment system responsive to the realities of the labour market of the 1990s. Further measures contained in the white paper will be included in social security legislation to be introduced later in these sittings.</PARA>
<PARA>The second reading speech goes on to say that some of the changes in this particular bill will include measures to broaden the range of work related options that the long-term unemployed and those at risk of becoming long-term unemployed can pursue while continuing to receive income support; in particular, a wider range of voluntary unpaid work. Those are the measures that I wish to speak on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members opposite will understand that the philosophical approach of the government's Working Nation statement was one of `growth plus'. That shorthand phrase is code for a need to maximise growth in the economy. We do that by ensuring that the economic parameters are right, and I will come to that in a moment. But if long-term unemployed people are to benefit from the recovery then we need to take special measures and additional steps to ensure that they share in the benefits which flow from economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will start by drawing attention to some of the current economic parameters and unemployment statistics. I refer honourable members to the most recent set of labour force figures, the August ABS labour force figures, which show that the number of people out of work in Australia has fallen to just over 830,000, the lowest level since August 1991. The unemployment rate in the same set of figures remained at 9.5 per cent. The encouraging statistics behind that figure were indicated in the press release of 8 September 1994 by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). In the preceding two months employment had grown by over 50,000, while over the year employment growth had been `a healthy 266,000 or 3.5 per cent.' The next important and very encouraging point that the minister makes in his press release on that day is the continuing fall in long-term unemployment, which is now 290,000; down from a peak of 366,000 in March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans), both opposition members present, will be particularly interested in the figures for our own state, Western Australia. Unemployment has fallen to eight per cent, from a high of 10 per cent a couple of years ago. Richard Court happened to arrive at the scene at the right time, but none of Richard Court's policies have had anything to do with increasing employment in Western Australia. On the contrary. I will not divert myself by giving the two honourable members opposite a lecture on the benefits which have come to the Western Australian economy as a result of the fundamental changes made by this government over the last 10 years. The sheepish smile on the face of the member for Forrest tells me there is no need to continue on that particular line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as some general economic parameters are concerned, it is important to remind members opposite that, as the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has been saying for some time, we now have the best set of economic fundamentals that we have seen in this country for some time. We are on a budget deficit reduction program, to bring it down to less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. We are 30 per cent more competitive than we were a year ago. Our economic growth to March of this year was five per cent, and we continue to do better than our trading partners in terms of inflation. The last inflation figure, from memory, was about 1.7 per cent, and the trend line for inflation continues to go from just over two to about 1.9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, we have consolidated low inflationary expectations. Our exports continue to thrive, particularly the increases in services exports and in elaborately transformed manufactured exports. Despite the efforts of Premier Kennett in Victoria, we have had the lowest industrial disputation in this country for about 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the highest levels of business confidence in 30 years and the highest levels of consumer confidence since those figures were taken. In the growth equation, I referred to our philosophy on this side of the House of `growth plus'. There are further steps in the white paper to maximise economic growth but the fundamentals are already there&mdash;low inflation, low inflationary expectations, business confidence, consumer confidence, productivity, international competitiveness, low industrial disputation and increasing exports. The white paper incentives for business to invest bring to almost $3 billion for the 1994-95 financial year the amount of incentives for business to invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the incentives for business in the white paper include: increased access to capital for business, particularly small business; the coordination of the full range of government assistance programs and services for business under one agency, which is AusIndustry; the suspension of the training guarantee levy; a training wage for adults and juniors; reform of the CES and private competition for the CES in the case management area; a more effective government purchasing policy; increased access to business to research and development tax concessions to develop good Australian ideas; further measures to encourage exporting companies; and measures to further enhance trade in our region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see from these measures that the central aim of the white paper is to build stronger industry in Australia and to maximise the capacity and potential for economic growth because continuing strong rates of growth are essential to job creation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, we are committed to the view that long-term sustainable jobs can come only from the private sector and that is why the white paper provides further real incentives to business to invest and to create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspects of the white paper package are on the plus side. These are special measures taken to ensure that long-term unemployed people reap the benefit of economic recovery. For the long-term unemployed, the purpose of the white paper is essentially to break the cycle of long-term unemployment and to do that through work opportunities, work experience and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central measure in the white paper, to ensure that long-term unemployed people are picked up, is the job compact. The purpose of the job compact is to break the cycle of long-term unemployment. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley), wearing that cap before him have said, it is about making long-term unemployed people more productive and more adaptable. It is not about `make work' schemes; it is about giving the long-term unemployed a helping hand, not a handout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In return for those special measures, we find in the white paper the reciprocal obligation measures that this bill in part refers to. The long-term unemployed will have an obligation to take all reasonable steps to accept work or to accept government offers of a placement in the compact. So the compact guarantees to a long-term unemployed person of over 18 months one of the following measures: provision of the training wage; private sector job subsidies; new self-employment opportunities; public sector work experiences; new work opportunities in the voluntary community area; training and placement opportunities for unemployed young people who immediately leave school; and further voluntary work options for people to take in the voluntary community section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, we have the changes which again are, in part, reflected by this bill. There are changes to make sure that the social security system, and its mix and its match with low income families, provides a greater choice to ensure that there will always be a reward to take a low wage job rather than relying on income support or welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What attitude and approach do those opposite take to the white paper and what is their solution to long-term unemployment? The first categorisation that one needs to make is that those opposite would not have spent any money on the white paper measures. So the first thing we need to understand is that the measures here would not have gone ahead under those opposite. The second categorisation that one needs to make is that those opposite went to the last election with very firm commitments in this area. Their solution to unemployment and long-term unemployment was threefold: to tip people off the dole after nine months; to slash $800 million out of outlays for labour market programs and the unemployed; and, their central focus, to slash wages. That is their ever-present solution to all perceived ills&mdash;to slash wages. I will come to the question of wages and those opposite shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the House, the Working Nation white paper reflects our commitment to ensure that we do not have an underclass in Australia comprised of long-term unemployed people. The measures which those on the other side would adopt would have that effect. We stand for taking special measures to pick up long-term unemployed people. The effect of the measures that those opposite are handcuffed to would be to create an underclass in Australia&mdash;a permanent underclass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a key point to be made about jobs. Jobs are, of course, vitally important to our quality of life&mdash;not just to reduce unemployment but to provide long-term, secure, better paid jobs. Our philosophical commitment goes to ensuring that we see an Australia which is a high wage Australia, a high productivity Australia, a high growth Australia, a high employment Australia and a low inflation Australia. That will see the provision not just of jobs but of better paid jobs. In addition to the effect of the measures that those opposite would adopt, being to create a permanent underclass in Australia, their policy on wages would see, effectively, a working poor in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make some comments about the national wage case which came down yesterday and to contrast the response of the government to the national wage case with that of those opposite. I refer to the report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Thursday, 22 September. The front page article on the national wage case by Mark Davis says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yesterday's decision also awarded in full the ACTU claim, supported by the Federal Government, for a wages "safety net" worth a total of $24 a week to protect real living standards of workers without the industrial muscle to secure enterprise deals.</PARA>
<PARA>There are two key points there: firstly, the government's commitment to the safety net; and, secondly, the government's commitment to ensure wage increases for those workers not covered by enterprise bargaining arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A subsidiary point is referred to in a block on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which refers to an inside story at page 10 by Mark Davis. I simply quote the block on the front page, where Mark Davis says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Forget "$24 pay rise" headlines . . . the news is how little yesterday's decision will add to the nation's wages bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an important point which those opposite have comprehensively failed to understand. Those points become crystal clear if one turns to the coverage of the national wage decision in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. I quote from the front page story in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industrial Relations Commission yesterday opened the way for hundreds of thousands of workers to receive pay rises of up to $24 per week.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Opposition, conservative States and employer organisations bitterly attacked the decision to grant the wage increases . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission reaffirmed the award system would remain the appropriate safety net of wages and conditions. . . The Federal Government and the ACTU yesterday welcomed the decision. . . In its decision, the commission found the national economic recovery was "well established", with a strong potential for growth.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that just about summarises the attitude that we on this side of the House take and the attitude of those opposite on the question of working people in this country getting a fair share of economic recovery. Those opposite oppose the $24 safety net. We never hear from them when the question of executive salaries is raised, but whenever there is a national wage case we always hear them opposing it. Honourable members opposite should indicate to us the last occasion on which they supported a national wage case increase for workers. You have got to go back a long time to find it&mdash;if, indeed, you can find it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers in recent years have worked harder and with greater productivity; they have worked longer and have restrained their wage claims. Yesterday's national wage case is a welcome acknowledgment of the sacrifices that those workers have made. On this side of the House, we believe the decision is a responsible one. It recognised the sacrifices made by workers in recent years in the interests of job creation and of making Australia more internationally competitive. This is basically a decision for those who are industrially weak and who cannot access enterprise bargaining. If those opposite had their way, over time, those industrially weak workers&mdash;for whom we support a safety net and a $24 increase&mdash;would basically be working for slave wages, and would become working poor in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The philosophical commitment on this side of the House is twofold: economic recovery is also for the long-term unemployed and for low-wage workers as well. It is not an economic recovery for the top end of town. Those groups are entitled to responsible wage increases and to their fair share. When we summarise those differing philosophical approaches, as far as this side of the House is concerned, when it comes to long-term unemployment and the policies that we adopt to help the long-term unemployed, our philosophy is reflected in Working Nation, and in the bill before the House: it is to maximise economic growth but to take special measures to ensure that those groups are picked up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of my colleague the shadow minister and member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) and his amendments. I want to make a few comments about the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith). I want to address a couple of things that he said in his last speech and question a few of the points that he brought forward. Firstly, he said that, at the last election, we would have been tipping people off the dole at nine months. That is quite a fabrication; it is nowhere near being the truth. Later on I will be explaining how the Labor government will in fact be tipping people off the dole with its job compact, and I will be giving some evidence for that particular case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Perth also spoke about the $24 increase to salaries that was announced yesterday. I wonder whether he actually understands the concept of small business. A $24 increase in salary may in fact be okay, but he does not seem to realise the on-costs associated with such an increase. It will not just be $24; it will in fact be more like $72 a week in costs to the employer. So this feeling about it being `only $24 a week' should be seen in the total context of on-costs associated with applying this $24 increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also said that unemployment was coming down. He stated a lot of figures associated with the long-term employed&mdash;and I will go through them&mdash;and how the great unemployment hoax is being perpetuated. If that is the case and if the government is creating all these jobs, why do we still have over 800,000 people out of work? If it has created 250,000 jobs in the last period, why are there still over 800,000 people out of work? He said that business confidence was up. I do not see a lot of business people, in particular small business people, saying how wonderful the economy is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who listened closely to the member for Perth would get the feeling that there is absolutely no unemployment problem in Australia now. Everyone is so confident; everyone is so happy; everyone is so wonderfully pleased about the current situation in Australia now. If you had listened to the statistics that government members continually talk about on the other side, you would come to the notion that there is no problem. Unfortunately, there is a problem. Over 800,000 Australians are out of work in Australia right now&mdash;and this is not a problem that should be addressed by parliamentarians in this place; it is a problem that should be addressed by the whole community. We all should be working together, not ignoring the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular bill is an omnibus bill and is fairly typical of how the Labor Party handles legislation through this place. It couples together a number of aspects of legislation, hoping that the whole thing will be discussed at any one time. It leaves us limited time to be discussing certain elements of it, thus forcing the parliament to approve it, as we will be doing. The effect of this is to reduce the whole concept of parliament&mdash;raising issues in parliament and bringing those issues home to the community&mdash;and not to allow proper debate. The bill primarily addresses the white paper. It attempts to amend the bill, apparently to fix some administration problems associated with applying the white paper concepts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the white paper since its release. If we look at what has happened in our economy since the release of this great white paper, Working Nation, what has actually happened? Nothing has happened. We have still got high unemployment. We have still got a lack of small business confidence, although the government will quote figures that business confidence is going up. Talk to any small business people and what will they say? They will say that it is pretty hard doing business out there right now. So business confidence is not really improving at the moment in small business areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the current status of Australia with regard to jobs. I saw some press reports recently which stated that there was a low level of trades personnel in Australia right now. There are fewer trades men and women in Australia than there have been for a long time. What that means is that we need apprentices in Australia to overcome the shortage of skilled labour we are going to have in a couple of years time. Looking at the current apprenticeship level, we have the lowest level of apprenticeship that we have had for over 10 years, in fact over 20 years. The figure for apprentices as a proportion of the labour work force is 1.6 per cent, which includes trainees at the moment. That is the lowest figure since 1968. That is from the ABS labour force statistics. So apprentices are down. Tradespeople are down. We are going to have an ongoing shortage of skilled tradespeople in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has been in parliament long enough to understand that there is a wide ranging debate on unemployment at the moment, and I am covering a number of issues which the government continually perpetuates in this place. The government says that university places are up 30 per cent. That is in fact true. Why is there this 30 per cent increase? Because people are staying at university, and therefore younger people still cannot get places in universities. The youth of our country are being denied the opportunity of tertiary education, therefore they are trying to find work, and therefore there are more of them unemployed. The unemployment rate for our youth in Australia is over 30 per cent. The parliamentary secretary was trying to deny me the opportunity of talking about the youth of Australia, which is typical of the ALP's attitude towards our future.</PARA></TALK.START>

But I will quote, for the honourable member's benefit, some facts. I have a fact sheet called `The great unemployment hoax'. The first fact is that unemployed people will be dismissed from receiving unemployment benefits. As evidence of this I will quote from the statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) in the House on 24 August. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to enter into a case management activity agreement&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or to abide by the conditions of a case management activity agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>read `performance contract'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will have the same effect for the job seeker as failure to enter into a Newstart activity agreement or a job search agreement or failure to comply with the terms and conditions of those agreements. In other words, it will lead to a loss of allowances for some period of time.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that taking people off unemployment benefits? The answer to that is clearly yes. Page 116 of the Working Nation policies and programs document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">long-term unemployed people will be under an obligation to accept a reasonable offer of a job or lose entitlement to income support for a period.</PARA>
<PARA>Is that taking people off unemployment benefits? Answer: yes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second fact is that unemployed people will be required to sign performance contracts. No-one else in Australia, no working person who comes under an award system, is required to sign a performance contract, yet the ALP government wants our unemployed people to sign a performance contract. The evidence was stated by the minister on 24 August 1994. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Case managers will work with the job seeker to negotiate a case agreement activity agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>read `performance contract'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will set out a course of action tailored to particular needs of a job seeker and agreed between the case manager and the job seeker&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a performance contract&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of delivering case management services, a case management activity agreement will be developed and agreed by the case manager and the job seeker.</PARA>
<PARA>The third fact states that the signing of a performance contract is compulsory and that unemployed people are required to sign a job compact. The job compact will apply to all people who have been in receipt of a jobsearch or newstart allowance for 18 months or more. That is on page 117 of the Working Nation statement. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V5">Mr RICHARD EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking to the amendment, parliamentary secretary. The fourth fact states that if people do not perform, if they do not accept a job offer and if they do not keep the job they will lose their benefits. On 24 August the minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The case management activity agreement will require a job compact client to accept any offer of suitable paid work or any offer of a placement under new work opportunities or the new enterprise incentive scheme and case managers will have a responsibility to monitor a job seeker's activity against his or her agreement and provide relevant information to the CES.</PARA>
<PARA>The white paper is nothing but a hoax. After six months of being on the jobs compact, the unemployed are guaranteed a job offer, if not a training program. To support this claim, page 116 of the white paper, Working Nation, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will offer an employment place to people receiving NSA who have been on allowance for more than 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, if people do not take a job offer, they lose their benefits. Imagine a person living in Manly in Sydney who has been offered a job in Cronulla. Say that person is 45 years of age, has no car and has been offered a labourer's job. If that person does not take that particular job, he or she is off the benefits. Is that dropping people from the dole? Yes, it is. Page 115 of the Working Nation document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An offer of a job is the core feature of the "Job Compact" which the Government is providing to those who have been on unemployment allowances for over 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA>We are talking here about a job offer, not a job. If a person does not take the offer, he or she can go onto a training program such as the LEAP program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us work our way through this. If people go on the LEAP program it lasts for six months. If they go on a subsidised training program, it lasts for six months. There is no guarantee that that subsidised job will be there after six months. What happens after six months? Clearly, they go back on the dole. Wow! That might be exciting. But the point is that they do not go back as a long-term unemployed person, they go back as a new unemployed person. They lose all the benefits of being long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP says, `Look at this: the number of long-term unemployed is coming down'. Let me tell members why it is coming down. It is coming down because people are being put into subsidised jobs or a LEAP training program for six months and that takes them off the long-term unemployment figures. When they have finished that, they go back on the unemployment figures. It is a great hoax; the great myth of the ALP. This is how the government is fixing long-term unemployment; it is moving people from one end to the other end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is dealing with figures but, in Australia, unemployed people are in fact people. They are fellow Australians and we as a community have a duty to these fellow Australians. Why do we allow statistics to be mentioned that claim that there is no problem with the unemployed in Australia, that the country is growing through the roof and that we are all getting the benefits of that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do benefits exist out in the community now for the 800,000 or more unemployed, including those of our youth who cannot get into university or into jobs? Why do Australian males who are under 25 have one of the greatest suicide rates in the world? Why are these young men suiciding? Does it have anything to do with the current economic situation? Does it have anything to do with the unemployment situation? Does it have anything at all to do with loss of hope and direction? Does it have anything at all to do with the blase way in which the ALP has been treating our people in Australia? Does it have anything to do with those factors at all? The answer to that is yes, it probably has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sit here and listen to those in the Labor Party tell us all these wonderful stories about the way things are going in our community. And do you know what? The press and other people in this place believe them. But the community as a whole, certainly in my electorate, does not believe them any more. We have had these stories for 11 years. Remember the great recovery we had in 1987, how well it was all going? No, interest rates were not going to go up! They are saying the same thing now. Remember unemployment back in 1987? It was not 10 per cent or nine per cent; it was more like three or four per cent. Then we went into a downturn. Those in the Labor Party created the most significant crisis this country has faced in the last 60 years. They are now saying exactly the same thing as they said in 1984, 1985 and 1987&mdash;and, as a community, we are beginning to believe it. It is time we said, `No more!' It is time we said that this government has to stand accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about 800,000 of our fellow Australians out there&mdash;they are not statistics; they are unemployed. What they want is a job. They want opportunity and they want hope. This Working Nation statement has nothing to with that. It is all about making people jobs-ready, about jobtraining people, getting people off the long-term unemployed list and putting them back at the start of the whole employment cycle again. This is the way those in the Labor Party work&mdash;they fudge the figures, and we begin to believe them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a growing anger out there about the lack of opportunity for our youth. They do not have the same opportunities we had 20 or 30 years ago. They do not have the choice of jobs that we had 20 or 30 years ago. They cannot get into university. They cannot get jobs. Who is responsible? Is it the employers who are responsible? Is it the churches who are responsible? Who is responsible? The government is responsible. The government is made up of the ones who are responsible. We have people like the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio), who has been in parliament for so long, yet she is still a parliamentary secretary, stating that social security is the preferred option. People do not require social security; they require a job. With this government, they cannot get the jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers have no incentive to employ. Those opposite say, `Look, it's not a problem; we've just increased salaries by $24.' Has that affected payroll tax? Mr Deputy Speaker, what if you as an employer have a payroll limit of $400,000 before you have to start to pay tax of five per cent? If your payroll is $380,000 at the moment, would you employ an extra person who will take your payroll over that limit necessitating the payment of tax on the entire $400,000? The answer is no, you would not. If you were to employ an extra person, suddenly five per cent of your profit would go out the door. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet here we are trying to encourage the Labor Party, the government, to use some sort of commonsense, bipartisan approach to create some jobs for our 800,000 Australians who are out of work. It is time that those in the ALP stopped this ridiculous playing with figures&mdash;statistics and damned lies&mdash;and addressed the problem and created some work. The only way they can create work is to give the incentive to employers to employ people. Yet, if we listen to their debate, all they talk about is social security and dragging people back down to the bottom line&mdash;lowest common denominator stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not rely on those in the ALP, the government, to get us out of this mess, because it will not. It will create a bigger problem.

On 25 August the committee was asked to consider the bills, including amendments and new clauses moved on behalf of the government, and to prepare a report. This is the third advisory report on proposed legislation prepared by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bills is to give effect to changes announced in the Working Nation white paper. The bills introduce an innovative approach to the delivery of services to unemployed people. This approach involves harnessing the expertise available in the public, community and private sectors to assist unemployed people to gain new skills and find jobs. The case management process established by the bills will provide individually tailored assistance to eligible job seekers registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. Widespread support for the bills was expressed during the committee's inquiry, and most groups welcomed the government's introduction of the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill, or the main bill, introduces three major changes. The first change is the introduction of competition into the delivery of case management services. The second major initiative is the establishment of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, or ESRA, whose role is to set up and regulate the case management system. Lastly, the bill provides for the establishment of Employment Assistance Australia, which will be the government's main case management organisation formed from part of the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill amends certain acts consequent upon the enactment of the main bill. These include the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988, the Privacy Act 1988, the Freedom of Information Act 1982, the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report I am tabling today makes 28 recommendations which are aimed at clarifying aspects of the bills. The main issues addressed by the committee include the regulation of the case management system; privacy and the protection of confidential information; the extension of the administrative law package to organisations outside the public sector; and the amount of detail included in disallowable instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has paid special attention to the needs of job seekers who could be considered as the most disadvantaged in their search for work. The committee is keen to ensure that people in rural or remote areas have the same opportunities to access these new service delivery arrangements as all other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ESRA is responsible for the regulation of the case management system, which will involve an accreditation scheme, the introduction of codes of practice, and certain investigation and monitoring powers. The committee is of the opinion that the powers given to ESRA by the bill are appropriate and necessary for it to fulfil its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management system requires that substantial amounts of personal information are transferred between organisations. To ensure that this information is treated properly, the Employment Services (Consequential Amendments) Bill allows for the extension of parts of the Privacy Act and the Freedom of Information Act to all contracted case managers. The committee is satisfied that personal privacy will be protected, but believes it is essential that an education and training strategy is implemented to ensure that contracted case managers are aware of their responsibilities under these acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the detail of the bill is contained in disallowable instruments. This issue engendered much discussion and was investigated by the committee. The bill allows for 13 disallowable instruments to be created either by the minister or by ESRA. The committee believes that the main bill would be clearer and more effective legislation if some of the information contained in the disallowable instruments was included in the bill. However, the committee also understands that it is necessary to implement these initiatives as soon as possible and that a certain amount of flexibility may be required in the early stages of operation of the case management system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has therefore recommended that the situation be reviewed in 12 months, when the case management system will be more established, with a view to including in the act much of the information that is contained in the disallowable instruments. The committee also recommends that, in the interim, the government release drafts of the disallowable instruments prior to the passage of the bills through the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 7 September, after the public hearings of the inquiry had been conducted, the committee received an additional set of amendments to the consequential amendments bill. These amendments relate to the reciprocal obligations of people in receipt of the jobsearch or newstart allowances, and partly remove the effect of amendments to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Act 1994, which came into effect on 12 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the Social Security Act provided for an additional two payments to be made to job seekers whose allowances had been deferred due to a breach of obligations. The amendments to the consequential amendments bill before the committee remove the requirement to make these two additional payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not have sufficient time to consult widely on the effect of these amendments, which involve a complex policy matter that the committee could not investigate fully. The main issue to be addressed is the amount of notice that is given before income support payments are deferred due to a breach of obligations. The committee is of the opinion that it is essential that due warning be given before payments are deferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that remove these two additional payments are not consequent upon the introduction of the Employment Services Bill. The committee accepts, however, that such provisions are not outside the broad scope of the long title of the consequential amendments bill, which is to amend laws `in consequence of the enactment of the Employment Services Act 1994, and for other purposes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practical necessity of the amendment must be recognised, but the committee does not consider that it is acceptable practice to introduce amendments by means of a bill that deals with a related act. Proposed provisions that affect the rights of individuals and are significant in terms of policy should be introduced to the parliament by way of a bill intended principally to amend the relevant act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case management system begins operation on 1 January 1995 and the community, the government and members of parliament, including committee members, are anxious to have the legislation in place as quickly as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is an advisory report on the Employment Services Bill 1994. The committee took considerable evidence in a fairly rushed period with regard to the government's decision to establish Employment Assistance Australia and the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. Whilst the original government decision was not canvassed by the committee, I know that some of my colleagues are in doubt as to whether this is an appropriate response to meet the government's claimed objective of giving assistance to the long-term unemployed and disadvantaged job seekers. Be that as it may, our job as a committee was to examine whether this was an appropriate process and whether the legislation before the parliament was an appropriate process to meet the government's objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I would have to say that we felt that, to a fair degree, the government's goals have been met by this legislation but that there are shortcomings in significant areas. The haste with which the process was being prepared&mdash;with multiple amendments appearing in the House even whilst the committee was in session&mdash;does not indicate that there has been a well thought through process. The fast-track proposal by the government to lobby to the parliament a framework of legislation and then attach disallowable instruments to it is not a very appropriate way to have the parliament, in an intelligent manner, consider what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the disallowable instruments come in at some later stage and may or may not meet the goals of the parliament. In order to make changes, the parliament cannot amend but must disallow holus-bolus. That becomes a very difficult process for members and senators and it is one that both houses of parliament have tended to reject. The parliamentary committee reflects the views of the members of that committee and the members of this House who do not like being given an option to suck it and see. They want to know the detail. They are responsible people acting on behalf of their communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Flexibility in some instances of job programs needs to be maintained. I think we all acknowledge that. You may suddenly find a group of people that you unexpectedly assess do not fall within the scope or ambit of a program, and you may need to move to bring them in to provide assistance to them. I think that everyone here understands that. But, in the view of the committee, 13 disallowable instruments attached to a framework of legislation is undesirable. Recommendation 18 of the committee's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in general, substantive matters should be included in primary legislation so that the content of the scheme is clear. The inclusion of such matters in disallowable instruments should be the exception rather than the rule.</PARA>
<PARA>In this instance, I think the government is inviting a fair degree of hazard in what it is proposing to do. This bill&mdash;and subsequent amendments to other bills&mdash;was approached with a lot of goodwill by members of the committee. They understand the government's goals. They questioned whether another statutory authority was needed, whether all of the carry-on that is attached to this legislation was needed and whether the programs could be delivered in another way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One new thrust here is that private individual counsellors and people expert in providing information to job seekers will be involved. That is an innovation. All of us who have been involved in jobclub, skillshare programs, NIESS programs or the like understand that there is expertise in charitable, hospitable organisations in the community and amongst private practitioners. They are excellent people who ought to be turned loose and given the opportunity to assist the unemployed equip themselves to gain employment. We all endorse that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives seem to be clear, but there is a lot of unthought out substance between where we are now and where the government would like us to be. Things such as conditions of employment, case loads and the role of private counsellors or case managers are lacking in the framework that we as a House are considering. Even the priorities given by private case managers are lacking. These are some of the things that the committee came to grips with. It was the view of the committee that we should not delay the commencement date of 1 January. That is commendable. We all want the scheme to start up. However, I believe that the government has to go like billyo to get things right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made its recommendation. If the government does not follow this recommendation, it is buying trouble. It must have before the houses of parliament the disallowable instruments in full and complete written form before the House passes the legislation. To do otherwise is to accept that somewhere back in the bureaucracy or in the minister's office there is all wisdom and it has all been sorted out and finalised, and we pass the legislation and hope it goes right. I think that a lot of people in this place are very closely involved in their communities, know what problems can arise and are fearless in giving advice to the government about how they can be prevented. So, in the view of the committee, the government must present the drafts of the disallowable instruments arising from the Employment Services Bill to be circulated before the passage of the bill through the parliament is completed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other matters in the legislation. It has been a very interesting inquiry. I would like to thank my colleagues who are part of that committee. We believe that the privacy factors have been well attended to. It was an area that concerned some of us. There has been reasonable effort to prevent any breach of privacy or information about groups of individuals through data matching or about single individuals through private matters becoming known. So, with the recommendations adopted by the government, we believe the legislation should go ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;First I would like to commend the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and its staff. The fact that there was in so little time such a comprehensive report produced is largely a tribute to those who have spent far more time in the consideration of these issues than I confess that I have, although I am a member of the committee. Judy Middlebrook and those with her deserve great commendation, as does the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to look at what we have and where we are going and to register my concern at the way the legislation on which this advisory report is presented has come into the House with inadequate consideration. The genesis was the green paper presented at the end of 1993 after about six months of deliberations by the government on what all of us see and what the government should recognise as a major social and economic problem, that is, continued high unemployment and its fallout and the way the far too many long-term unemployed are finding difficulty in getting jobs. Nearly five months later, in May 1994, the white paper Working Nation was presented. It was followed very shortly by this bill, the Employment Services Bill, on which this advisory opinion is presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty I have is that the government, if it had acted in the way that it should have, would never have got itself into the dilemma of presenting a totally inadequate piece of legislation to the parliament. It should not have been necessary for the committee to go through, as it has, a number of recommendations which suggest that when the government has worked out just what those other adjuncts to the administration of the bill are, which are going to come in by way of disallowable instruments, they should become part of the bill. Recommendation 28 essentially says that the disallowable instruments in clause 53 should be reviewed in 12 months to determine whether the definition of case management documents and case management rules can be incorporated in legislation. In my mind they should be in the legislation and the legislation should not be presented in the first place in a totally inadequate form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have several fundamental concerns. The first is with respect to the running and operation of unemployment services. While Hilmer may well be a base by which you can induce efficiency&mdash;although I remain to be convinced&mdash;I am concerned that the Employment Services Bill is going to restructure the Commonwealth Employment Service in such a way as to provide yet another field for bureaucratic intervention. There are some very good people in the CES. All of us as members have regular contact with them. I remain to be convinced that setting up yet another agency, in this instance Employment Assistance Australia, will provide any better service to the unemployed. I want to help the unemployed. I am not there to help the instruments that provide help. I want to get the unemployed genuinely into employment. I remain to be convinced that the Employment Services Regulatory Authority and Employment Assistance Australia are the vehicles we should adopt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At other times in other places I have expressed strong views about Mrs Joan Kirner having been appointed as chairman of the Employment Services Regulatory Authority in view of the fact that she apparently applied on the grounds of ill health to get an additional payout from the Victorian parliamentary superannuation scheme. If she is not well enough to be a member of parliament, in my mind, responsibility as the chairman of ESRA should also be a matter for which she should have a health clearance. I am not aware that she did so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the actual detail, the only other thing I wanted to refer to is a letter that came as one of the submissions to the inquiry. It has been accepted as submission No. 22, and is from the Brotherhood of St Laurence under the hand of Mr Ian Brain, director of the central highlands region. He makes two points. The first is that it is absolutely important that, if case management is to be introduced, you look at the extent to which case management is going to follow the long-term unemployed through the term of their search for employment and then eventually their employment in what is meaningful employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter he picks up the fact that there is worry at the moment about the way in which labour market programs such as LEAP and jobskill are treated as employment, meaning that perhaps the case manager will lose contact with the person entering so-called employment when in fact it is not continuing, unsubsidised employment. I would have liked to have seen that letter given greater prominence in the report for, to my mind, the whole basis of this report is to help the long-term unemployed more properly into full-time, unsubsidised employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has introduced various devices to conceal the numbers of unemployed. Case management may be a way to help those who are unemployed into employment, but I remain to be convinced of the whole process. I commend the report to the House. It does have a number of recommendations which I think will improve the legislation, but I suggest that next time the government should introduce the first draft of the bill with a little less haste and attend to the detail without having to rely on a parliamentary committee to try to correct it. </PARA>

It is another example, now the third, of the benefits of reference of bills to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In this case, issues outside the normal range of issues considered by that particular committee were considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill involves the significant innovation of involving the private sector, bodies other than the Commonwealth Employment Service, bodies outside the Commonwealth Public Service, in the management of long-term unemployed. It gave rise to consideration of new issues, such as how to apply the normal safeguards relevant to dealings between citizen and government, such as rights of privacy and the like, in this context. It is an experiment in many respects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one could disagree with the objective of the legislation. It is simply to get the long-term unemployed into jobs. No-one could disagree with the objective of getting that done as quickly as possible. I say that because it is only on that basis that the form of legislation which leaves important matters to delegated legislation, as yet unwritten, disallowable instruments, could be in any sense acceptable. The committee has sought by its recommendations to ensure that what is properly the subject of acts of parliament is dealt with in acts of parliament and not in delegated legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of its work, the committee has given some consideration to another bill, a legislative instruments bill introduced in the Senate but not yet debated. This is also an important piece of legislation and, in my view, could properly be the subject of a further reference to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I would urge the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) so to move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Employment Services Bill is an experiment. I hope very much that it is an experiment that works. If it does work it will mean that many long-term unemployed will actually get a job. If it does not work, I hope that the government takes prompt action to amend the bill to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that it does work. I commend the report to the House and join with other speakers in expressing my appreciation to the secretariat, who worked hard and long to ensure that the report was produced on a timetable set by the government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very comprehensive package. It costs about $164 million over two years. Because it is essentially demand driven, if the exceptional circumstance areas are extended, it will end up costing the budget more than what was announced yesterday. The change to income support is being sought by many farm families. Even though they do not have an income from their farm, because of the assets test, they were unable to get the jobsearch allowance. The payment made under the jobsearch allowance was incapable of being paid as the assets test debarred many farmers who had substantial assets but no income. A new payment, the drought relief payment, will provide farm families with sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments will be made to farm families, and exceptional drought declared areas will not be subject to the assets test but will be subject to the JSA income and off-farm assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great concerns of the drought is that it is putting at risk the whole notion of the continuation of family farms and rural society. People are leaving farms and their children are not taking up farming. We want to keep farmers on their farms. By giving them income support and farm finance, they will have the chance to stay on their farm and carry on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern that farmers expressed to me, to Senator Collins and to other ministers, was that children, because of financial necessity, have needed to be withdrawn  from schools. From yesterday, to overcome this problem and to assist here, the existing Austudy farm assets test will be removed for all families in exceptional drought areas. The current Austudy income test happens to be more generous than the jobstart allowance income test. The Austudy income test is the one that will apply, not the assets test. That will mean that many children from farm families will be able to remain in schools and in secondary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to farm finance, as I said a few moments ago, the changes to the rural adjustment scheme will be demand driven. At the moment, it is cash limited. Even though somebody may succeed in an application for support, that person is often not fully paid because the scheme does not have enough money in it. We have now topped that up to make it demand driven. Eligible people will now get the full amount due to them&mdash;up to 100 per cent interest subsidy for viable farms. With the 100 per cent interest subsidy farmers can make the decision to either go on and put in another crop or use the subsidy to help manage the debt they have picked up in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned a moment ago that we have increased the limits under that farm finance RAS assistance from a maximum annual assistance of $50,000 to $100,000, and we are lifting the cumulative limit from $100,000 to $300,000. Under that arrangement between $1 million to $3 million worth of debt could be handled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we are excluding bona fide retirement assets. Many farmers have bought themselves a house in town or a house on the coast so that when their children take over the management of the farm they have somewhere to live. Under existing RAS arrangements, they had to sell those properties before they could receive RAS support. We are excluding bona fide retirement assets and off-farm assets of that nature from the RAS assets test, and that will make a tremendous difference in the capacity to qualify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To help farmers in the recovery phase, we are extending these arrangements six months beyond the end of the declaration of exceptional circumstances. As well as that, we are looking at the development of a set of incentives, the provision of farm storage and water facilities, a generous investment allowance and possibly faster depreciation. But we want to work this out with the peak farm bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a package, it comes down to these five things: giving income support, looking after the education of children of farmers in the drought, providing additional financial assistance to farms for carry-on finance and increasing dramatically the limits for maximum levels of assistance, improving the ability of farmers to access RAS without first selling off-farm and retirement income assets and developing an incentive for the provision of farm storage and water facilities. All those things add up to a very large change in public policy which has been adopted by the government for the support of the farm communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of the coalition cavilling at all of these changes, it should have been supporting them. Rather, the first question the Leader of the Opposition asked today was about his fodder subsidy. I hope this will really be of material assistance to Australian farmers and Australian farm families. As a consequence, they and their peak bodies will believe that their consultations with the government have been real and worth while.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the member for her question. While the drought is a matter of enormous importance and severity for those people who are directly affected by it, it also has a wider effect on the whole economy. The significance of the drought is such that we are now seeing a quite significant impact on the whole of the rural sector in terms of its overall performance. Farm incomes are forecast by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics to fall by about 27 per cent this year, with gross farm product down 16 per cent and net farm product down 28 per cent. The grain crops in particular are very severely affected, with wheat production to fall by 38 per cent and barley by 50 per cent. Of course, with effects like that in the rural sector, the overall economy has to feel the impact as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put the budget together, we had made some allowance for the drought but, in the months since, it has become much more severe and therefore the impact on the overall economy has to be altered. As calculated by the Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the overall effect of the drought now will be to reduce gross domestic product by about 0.5 of one per cent. That one-half of one per cent effect is on top of the effects that we had built into the budget, so we are looking at a significant impact on economic growth this year but still, having started at 4 1/2 per cent, having substantial underlying growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the direct effect; on top of that, we must expect secondary effects. Farmers who have less income spend less; therefore, there is a flow-on effect to other people in affected areas, and so one has an impact which is accentuated in that way. The package that the Prime Minister announced yesterday and expanded on today is going to cushion that effect to some extent. We will also be cushioned, in terms of the effect on the overall economy, by other developments since the budget and, in particular, by what is happening in the world economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take the time of the House to mention some aspects of that. We are particularly looking at economies like the United States, which marked up its growth for 1994 considerably from earlier this year&mdash;from three per cent to four per cent. Japan has marked its growth up slightly, and much more significantly for 1995. Germany, which originally expected growth this year of less than one per cent, is now expecting growth of almost two per cent and 2 1/2 per cent next year. So growth for the OECD overall is expected to be one-half a per cent higher than originally expected for this year and much higher in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall effect of that for us is to push up our commodity prices. ABARE now forecasts that total international commodity prices will rise by five per cent in 1994-95, and the price of our rural commodities will rise by 11 per cent. Despite the drought, this will give us, according to ABARE's predictions, a record level of rural exports of $19.1 billion. I emphasise that, despite the drought, we will have a record level of rural exports.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But half a billion less than would otherwise be the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is certainly true. A major factor in  that record level is that wool prices are 30 per cent higher than last year, on the forecast, therefore giving us that record outcome. Other commodity prices&mdash;minerals&mdash;are also expected to be higher. Overall, we are seeing this as an offsetting factor of some considerable significance. The overall effect of the impact of the drought dragging growth down and the international recovery lifting growth up is expected to be that we will see growth for this year not at 4 1/2 per cent but about 4 1/4 per cent&mdash;a decline of roughly a quarter of a per cent of GDP. That is not an official forecast at this stage. ABARE's forecast is 4.3 per cent, and I think the view of the government at this stage would be that that is pretty right. So, despite the impact of the drought, we can see that the economy is fairly well cushioned from the overall effects, although there will be some impact of the order that I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of underlying features like employment, we are already seeing stronger growth than that which was forecast in the budget. There is no reason to expect that we will not do much better than the budget forecast on unemployment. We are already at the 9 1/2 per cent rate that was forecast in the budget. By the end of this financial year, we can expect to be well below that level. Severe as the drought is and important as it is for the rural sector, the overall impact on the economy is not going to be too severe as we see it at this stage.</PARA>

If the paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The rebirth of Australian industry</EMPHASIS> as cited by Tim Colebatch in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> is correct in arguing that sectoral policies not tariff cuts were responsible for the alleged rebirth of Australian industry, are we to conclude that Senator Cook's version of industry policy, which he described as the `next generation of industry policy', is simplistic and will do no more than bring uncertainty to the TCF industry and diminish rather than increase jobs in a significant Australian industry?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not read that article in any detail; I saw the headline on it this morning. There is no doubt that industry policy in Australia under this government has had two elements to it. The first element removed the notion that there is a right to easy profits and protection through the tariff barrier provided by tariff levels with effective rates for some industries in the 250 per cent area. It was believed that this was too large a burden to shoulder the Australian consumer with because there was not a decent trade-off in wages and employment for the kinds of costs which were imposed upon them, and that by removing the tariff wall we would introduce competition, competitive breezes, so that our industry was not only competent at import competition but also the whole notion would be supportive of the government's anti-inflationary policy. We have seen a very large change in tariff levels already, and the removal of tariffs is no doubt playing a role in maintaining inflation at a low level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important role of our industry policy is to change the psychology of industry. A notable member of an industry group came to me a week or two ago and said, `I'm a member of the 180-degree club.' I asked, `What's that?' and he said, `I'm one of those people who thought tariffs were 100 per cent right and I now think the policy has produced changes I could never have contemplated, with enterprise changes at the work place, people on the job looking for productivity improvements, and a changed attitude amongst executives. I have turned 180 degrees in favour of the government's policy. I never thought I would ever say that.' That is what I think has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support the government has given to particular sectors where it thought there was an opportunity for improvement has also helped. You can see this in shipbuilding, with the launch of the Anzac frigate this week, with the Collins class submarine when the government wanted a defence industry created, with the dual hulled aluminium catamaran ferries and with other lighter categories of ships, and in the computer software area. These things have made a difference, but I do not think you can argue that that is the reason why industry policy has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great respect for the person who wrote that article, but he does have a little axe to grind about tariffs and industry policy. I do not believe that an analysis of what has happened in Australia could lead anyone to conclude other than that the most telling policy change has been not the sectoral industry assistance plans but the removal of tariffs. That has been the primary change, and well it might have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked further about what trade-offs Australia might give for any removal of barriers elsewhere around the world. We have been principally through that with the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and the World Trade Organisation arrangements coming out of the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. So that is behind us. Of course, Australia's changes went far and away beyond anything that we might have been required to offer in the round.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In APEC, we are speaking about a GATT-plus set of arrangements. There is some prospect over time that, with a declaration of free trade in the Pacific, we could get to a point where there is a lot more market access for Australian industry. That may involve certain trade-offs at that point. If this ever happens, which I think it will, it is a long way off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has certainly happened is that we have seen an enhanced investment in the TCF industries. The growth in exports from TCF industries has been really quite profound. The fact that for the first time in decades we are now getting a real wave of quite strong investment in the TCF area means that the policy has worked. Those industries which the honourable member concerns himself with&mdash;and not unreasonably&mdash;and which went through a fairly substantial period of structural adjustment, particularly in Melbourne, have now stabilised themselves and are growing. They are finding that, with their new investments, they have more capacity to grow further. I think success breeds success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than fear any further change, what we want is a more pro-competitive, pro-trade environment. In essence, that has been the government's policy. We extended that in the GATT; we are extending that through into APEC. Were that to be the case, I am sure the Australian consumer would be better off. We would have lower prices but more volumes, and we would have an even stronger set of TCF industries in Victoria than we have this very day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government welcomes the decision of the Industrial Relations Commission yesterday to grant three $8 a week safety net pay rises. The decision is clearly consistent with enterprise bargaining principles and with the continuing low inflationary recovery of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first $8 is for those workers who have not received a wage increase as a result of enterprise bargaining since November 1991. November 1991 was some time away, yet we have seen an enormous pick-up in the economy and a huge pick-up in profits. It is not only sensible but just that such a wage increase should be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second pay rise is available from today at the enterprise level. It is subject to a number of tests, including that the union has genuinely sought an enterprise agreement and has been unsuccessful; in other words, that the union has not been able to access the enterprise bargaining stream. The third $8 will be available at the enterprise level from 22 September 1995. That will be for those without an enterprise bargain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a set of very just and sensible arrangements in a wage system which has served the country well for over a decade. Its safety net quality is such that, if an employee were to have received, say, a $20 a week enterprise bargaining related wage increase, he or she would be entitled to $4 under the safety net. In other words, this arrangement is of its essence a safety net, as the government said. When the legislation was introduced, the minister made clear why we think it is the sort of policy that holds together the award system as the guarantee of that safety net and, at the same time, why it allows for enterprise bargaining to go on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the commission has decided that it will develop a set of detailed principles by which awards can be reviewed through a pilot award review program. Where necessary, awards will be changed to make them easier to understand, easier to adapt to the needs of the enterprise, and non-discriminatory. Justice O'Connor said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have decided to introduce a range of measures to make the award system more flexible so that they are suited to particular needs of the enterprise. These measures will mean the effective use of enterprise flexibility clauses, facilitative provisions and majority clauses. In this process, the enterprise and its needs must be taken into account as well as consideration of an adequate safety net of award wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>So there you see, Mr Speaker, the commission comprehending the general view that the government has put and where we have seen these affordable increases come through.

You have to ask them what they want after there having been no wage increase for these people since 1991.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. Approximately 340,000 veterans receive some sort of entitlement from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Their average age is 73 years. Of those 340,000 veterans, approximately 40 per cent are aged over 75 years. It is envisaged that, by the year 2004, almost 70 per cent of them will be aged over 75 years. Interestingly enough, some 30 per cent of all males in this country over the age of 70 are, in fact, veterans.</PARA></TALK.START>

I have been told that there are some problems in terms of veterans getting appropriate aged care hostel places and nursing home places in certain areas. For instance, the War Widows Guild in Western Australia has a million dollars that it wants to spend to set up an aged veterans' home in Como in Western Australia, but it is unable to do so because there are not sufficient beds allocated to that region.</PARA>

That is what we are talking about. It seems that there is a demand for that sort of thing by the veterans, and that is what I am specifically being told.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. At the trial last week of former Western Australian Deputy Premier, David Parker, on charges of stealing donated campaign funds, the President of the Senate and former ALP state secretary, Senator Beahan, stated that the Labor Party had used campaign funds to pay the gambling debts of a Labor candidate. Yesterday, the Western Australian shadow Attorney-General, David Smith, on resigning from his shadow portfolio, was reported as saying that it was not true that the party had paid his gambling debts, that in 1991 and 1992 he had borrowed $40,000 from the Labor Party and that the loan had not come from campaign funds but had been borrowed by the party from a bank. Senator Chris Evans, another former ALP state secretary, is also reported as saying that the Labor Party had lent money to Mr Smith. In view of the consequence for Mr Parker of using campaign funds for private purposes, and in view of the conflict between the testimony of Senator Beahan on the one hand and the statements not under oath of Mr Smith and Senator Evans on the other, will the minister ask the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate the matter in order to determine whether the moneys came from campaign funds, from borrowings or indeed from public funding?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Victorian parliamentary committee found quite properly that the office of fair trading should act immediately in these matters. The committee made some strong recommendations to the Kennett government to establish an independent building disputes tribunal, which is exactly what the TPC has recommended, to increase the monitoring of the housing guarantee fund, to abolish compulsory arbitration clauses&mdash;the cause of so many of the problems&mdash;and to provide plain English contracts. There are many more recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Law Reform Commission was well on the way to developing just those sorts of answers to these problems&mdash;a uniform fair trading contract for home builders&mdash;which would have solved these problems, but the Kennett government has abolished the Victorian Law Reform Commission. So now we do not know where we stand on this issue. Yesterday I recommended that states follow this matter through; that, when the next ministerial council on consumer affairs meets, the states report that they have done something in this area for Australian consumers. I certainly hope that this report by the Victorian parliament will get some action going in that state.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which policy? That is well stated. They do not have a policy. They are ashamed. They have pulled every antic and trick to try to get out of this debate. But here they are and here we are to talk about drought, which is a matter of national importance and of great concern to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and the whole caucus of the Labor Party. It is a matter we have treated seriously. We have consulted and come out with a program of policies that has been extremely well received throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the way that that policy has been accepted throughout Australia. It demonstrates very clearly where the opposition stands with farmers and farm organisations. The Australian Council of Social Service said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This much needed initiative will be applauded by the whole Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, because not only country people but also people who live in cities are applauding it. It shows the way that community members in Australia support each other. It is also demonstrated in the `Farmhand' campaign that the Australian government&mdash;the federal Labor government&mdash;is supporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Farmers Federation president, Lex Buchanan, said on radio 4BC that he was very pleased with the package. National Farmers Federation president, Mr Donald McGauchie, said that the extra measures were significant and that they would be of enormous benefit to farm families in severe drought. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFF and our member bodies will work closely with the Government to develop final proposals in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA>The Grains Council of Australia president, Ian MacFarlane, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . PM and Bob Collins have done an extraordinary job in assisting drought-stricken farmers . . . quite outstanding . . . far better than (we) could have hoped for . . . closed off no avenues . . . gave a clear message there is hope . . . farmers can look forward to the future.</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales Farmers Association president, John Crawford, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very significant step . . . The government has taken an extraordinary step . . . a giant leap forward to solving a major problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister is to be applauded.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times </EMPHASIS>stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All reasonable people will applaud the drought relief package but especially the decision to abolish the assets test for assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>I wanted to go through these examples to show the sort of reaction we get from the opposition. Mr Garry Goucher said on 31 August in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that the opposition was a bit out of step with the industry. That was not a really strong statement. He understated the position. He also said that the centrepiece of the coalition's policy of a subsidy for fodder was riddled with problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of reaction did Garry Goucher, the director of policy for the NFF, really get? A person who is normally conservative and as straight and honest as they come was labelled an idiot by the office of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). In other words, if you do not agree with the opposition, you are an idiot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, Ian Causley, the New South Wales Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, said that groups which have supported the federal government's policy are out of touch with the farming community. In other words, what he is saying, and what you are really saying, is that the Australian Council of Social Service, the Queensland Farmers Federation, the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the New South Wales Farmers Association and others are out of touch. In other words, you are the only ones in touch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You come up with this line all the time. You say that the Labor Party does not understand and that the Labor Party is out of touch. But now you have gone that one step further. The Liberals think everybody else is out of touch with the farming community. The fact is that the Labor Party, all those farming groups and social service groups are not out of touch; the Liberal Party and the National Party are. Why did Ian Causley come out with that reaction? Because Donald McGauchie made this statement in his press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now up to the states&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>once again, an understatement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to meet their responsibilities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm organisations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>including the NFF&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be monitoring states' contributions closely.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why we got the reaction from Ian Causley, the New South Wales state agriculture minister, and that is why you have labelled all these groups as being out of touch with the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how do you develop your policy? Do you develop it through consultation and with integrity? Do you make it well constructed? No. Let us have a look at how you do it. A report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>of 9 September states:</PARA>

<PARA>in other words, the bloke in my position on your side&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Little time was spent debating the policy in the shadow Cabinet of August 29, despite the potential fiscal size of the package, although one proposal from Anderson for concessional loans&mdash;to help reconstruct the sector after the drought ends&mdash;was sent to a special shadow Cabinet sub-committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we go again. As soon as they are hurting a bit, it is rattle, rattle, rattle&mdash;a death rattle. That is the connection I want to make. I want to explain it to them. They have not consulted with all the peak farmer bodies such as those in New South Wales. They have not consulted. If they had gone through the proper process of developing policy, they would have come up with a policy very much like ours. But, no, the centrepiece of their policy is the old fodder subsidy, the oldest credited fodder subsidy, a fodder subsidy that provides a disincentive for producers to prepare for drought. Fodder subsidies tend to jolt demand, sending fodder prices through the roof. You have heard the Prime Minister today telling you about the corruption in the Queensland National Party in the past. You had a fodder subsidy up there in the 1980s of which 75 per cent&mdash;three-quarters&mdash;went to 16 per cent of the farmers. That is what you want to bring in again.</PARA></TALK.START>

The new president of the Cattlemen's Union, John Purcell, said he had concerns over the possible market distortions which such a scheme could hold.

You should not have too much trouble getting eligibility. After all, your last crop of policies was released in Fightback nearly four years ago and there was no pay dirt in that.

In comparison, the measures that we have introduced have been applauded throughout Australia by the peak bodies and by other bodies that you now say do not represent farmers. The drought relief payment will provide farm families with sufficient cash for basic necessities and services. Payments under DRP will be available to farm families in areas assessed to be in exceptional drought and will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to the jobsearch allowance. The existing Austudy farm asset tests will be removed for all families in exceptional drought areas. </PARA>

The first area is in personal abuse&mdash;we saw that today&mdash;and the second is that he deliberately misconstrues our position, implying that there is but one aspect to our policy when I know for a fact that he was corrected on that yesterday. He was brought right across our very comprehensive and longstanding policy position in a whole range of areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You, my friend, belong to an outfit that has essentially gutted many things when it could have prevented a lot of the heartache now in place. You come in here and ask us to pat you on the back for having returned some of the vital drought assistance measures that you yourselves gutted 10 years ago. You want to be congratulated for recognising the drought years after it got serious in many parts of this country. You want to make out that you have paved a new way when, in truth, all you have actually done in many areas is match the coalition's long established relief measures, without yet matching the thing you keep talking about&mdash;preparing farmers for drought in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You want us to call you the saviours of the bush when it is your policies that have so crippled the capacity of the bush to cope with this mess and it is your policies that are increasing the cost burdens at the very time that we need to be reducing them. An amount of $164 million over a couple of years might be quite a bit of money, my friend&mdash;and we have welcomed the package as far as it goes&mdash;but let me remind you that that is for two years. We have just seen a three-quarters of a per cent rise in interest rates which will cost $120 million across the farm sector. We have warnings that there will be another one per cent rise in interest rates before Christmas, so that will cost another $170 million. Strike a light, I think you have a hide, my friend: you have a hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made it quite plain that we welcome the package as far as it goes. Of course we welcome the package as far as it goes. In terms of the relief it provides, it neatly matches the essence of our package for relief. You want to focus on just one aspect of what we have put up. You want to highlight one bit that has engendered a bit of debate, but we actually set out our policy quite clearly in terms of three Rs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first was relief, which covered the need to provide effective quarantining from assets testing. Farmers facing decimation could not access what other Australians have been able to access for so long. You claim it is a big thing to finally put farmers in the package in the same bracket as others after years of hardship. You are beyond belief. That was No. 1. We put that up clearly. It has been there for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second was retention. It was about retaining as many of our viable farmers as possible, with as much of their farm infrastructure as possible. You have gone some way towards addressing that. You have gone a long way down the very way we recommended. The third is recovery. You have said you will talk about that as well. Welcome to the club, my friends. But we were there before you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You talk about consultation. You forget something. Where are all the farmers on that side? It just happens that a lot of us on this side are farmers. It just happens that some of us never stop moving amongst farmers. It just happens that some of us run farm businesses in some of the worst drought affected parts of this country. We have put up with the sort of economic environment you have imposed on us year after year. You have expected us to cope with the chill winds of every market force available, while you have quarantined and pork-barrelled your mates. You are outrageous. We have been fair enough to thank you and to acknowledge the value of what you have put in place. You might at least acknowledge the broad basis of our own policy approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not back off that point. We move around a lot. Our policy has been in place for quite a while. I recall visiting Toowoomba, Queensland, about 18 months ago. When I was in Toowoomba one of the things that particularly disturbed me was that I heard stories about food parcels being needed all over the place. I had it put to me that there was a family tragedy being played out there and that kids in particular were suffering. That was 18 months ago. I came back into this place on 11 May 1993&mdash;you can find it on page 516 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 11 May&mdash;and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I stand here now, much of rural Australia faces nothing short of economic and social ruination. Huge areas of the continent now lie in drought, some 38 per cent of Queensland, some 23 per cent of New South Wales&mdash;and a lot more by the end of this month at the rate we are going&mdash;and many farmers are now in their third successive year without income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coupled with disastrously weak commodity prices and the appalling economic environment in which they have to operate, created by this Government, the future now looks extremely bleak for many of our nation's farmers . . . much of the trouble the farmers face is the responsibility of this Government. What is more important is that the capacity of our rural industries to survive and return to prosperity will be determined largely by what the Government does from this point on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must act and it must continue to act decisively to secure the future of the nation's rural industries. It must do so not just for the sake of affected farmers and their families but also for others. This is a  matter of the survival of the towns and the villages that service the bush and, in the end, it is a matter of vital national economic importance. There are literally billions of export dollars at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost every sector out there in the bush faces agonisingly difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to outline what was happening. That was 16 months ago. Then I warned of the personal tragedies when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lately I have been moving around a little bit, and I would like to ponder a few of the grim realities, the personal tragedies, that are taking place out there.</PARA>
<PARA>I outlined quite a few of those and went on to talk about the impact on families, about stress and suicidal despair being a reality. I pointed out that this was backed up by the comments, widely reported at that time, of the Reverend Noel Parke, director of Lifeline for south-west Queensland. Despite this, we have waited another 16 months for the government to act, and then it appears it only acted because of some marginal seats. As Tim Stevens of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> pointed out in his article of 17 September:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The story of how Keating came to be kicking dirt for evening news bulletins is also the story of a drought catching everyone by surprise&mdash;politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>some politicians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">bureaucrats, even farmers. It is a story of how social and economic imperatives on the government to act eventually dovetailed with Labor's political imperative&mdash;winning marginal seats in non-metropolitan Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>He cannot have been talking about our side of politics because we have been talking about this issue for a long time and we have had a policy in place for a long time that broadly and comprehensively covers drought. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has only just woken up to the severity of the problem. Only four or five weeks ago in Townsville he said, `Drought is a naturally recurring feature of the Australian environment and it is a farm management problem.' He dismissed it. But he suddenly discovered that he was way out of touch with where Australians were at. He found that he was condemned the length and breadth of the land. You talk about criticism by some people of one aspect of our policy, but your leader, the Prime Minister of this country, was rightly condemned the length and breadth of this country for his outrageously callous and misdirected remarks. It was only when he was shamed into it by the reaction of the Australian people to what he had said that he realised he had made a massive political mistake and reversed his position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he goes out into the bush and spends two hours with farmers. How long did he spend at the fashion parade in Sydney? He is an expert on farmers now. He knows them inside out. He can come in here and tell them what they think of the National Party. We have had a very solid drought policy for some years. I can wave it right here now if you want it. Had that policy been in place at the beginning of last year, when the election was held, the relief part of our package would have prevented a great deal of the heartache that we have seen. Remember? Relief was the first part of the package that we put forward. What is so amazing is that the difference between the rhetoric and reality in this place is obscuring the facts. You make out these vast differences. The relief part of your package simply catches up with the essentials of our program. You are still a long way from matching our farm retention and recovery package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a couple of observations on direct comparisons. Firstly, the coalition's policy for a long time now has been that it would provide immediate family farm income relief by revamping the farm household support scheme and suspending the assets test on welfare payments. The government effectively has achieved the same thing, the same sort of relief, the same sort of outcome, the same sort of dimensions. Secondly, the coalition for years has been calling for children from rural areas to be given equal access to education by suspending the assets test on Austudy during times of extreme hardship. What did the government do yesterday? It did the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the coalition has called for greater flexibility in increased funding under the RAS for farmers experiencing drought exceptional circumstances. While the government has allocated more money for RAS and eased requirements for the sale of non-farm assets, which is welcome, the basic eligibility criteria remain unchanged. We have yet to see just how many more farmers will get assistance under this package. Let us see the t's crossed and the i's dotted before we get too excited on eligibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the coalition has long recognised the need for assistance to cope once the drought breaks. We welcome the  government's adaptation of this principle by allowing farmers to apply for RAS exceptional circumstances up to six months after the drought declaration is revoked with as yet unspecified assistance available for a further 12 months. That again is the direction that our policy clearly went in. But you accuse us of not wanting to debate these issues when you refuse to even acknowledge that it is in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us come briefly to the question of the fodder subsidy, which was a new issue we raised. Shock, horror! The question of our national breeding flocks and herds is a very important national economic issue. It will not go away. There is a lot of misinformation going around. I note that it has died down a little. But the so-called escalation in prices that will result has happened. Over the last 12 months graziers have found that the price of wheat has gone from around $100 to $200 and they cannot afford it. It is virtually capped now because it is getting very close to world parity pricing. We still have a massive problem determining how we are going to keep our breeding flocks and herds alive. This is an issue that is not going to go away. Let me quote a few people who have differing views on this. Here is the flagship of Rural Press in this country:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's all very well for Primary Industries Minister, Bob Collins, and the National Farmers Federation to dismiss fodder subsidies as a flawed concept but the mounting evidence suggests no other aid measure will achieve the very necessary result of preserving the productive base of our livestock industries.</PARA>

Last Tuesday I was delighted when caucus unanimously endorsed that proposal. Obviously, in the time between 30 August and when the decision was reached yesterday by the cabinet a lot of work had been done, including a very successful visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to some drought ravaged parts of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear the comments of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), on who understands rural Australia. There is no doubt that the people on this side of the House understand what rural Australia is all about. We represent the largest country party in Australia, which has been the case for a number of years. We currently occupy some 28 seats that represent rural and provincial Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader is suggesting that there is a real dearth of people on our side who understand rural Australia, but I think the facts speak for themselves. People have successively supported this government over a number of years, including the period between 1983 and the last election. It is interesting that the number of seats we hold in rural and provincial Australia remains the same. There is a downward trend in the support of the Liberal and National parties not only in their policy issues but also in their representation in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant that the Liberal Party, this so-called once great party which is this year celebrating its 50th anniversary, is rapidly disappearing from rural and provincial Australia. Not too far behind it is the National Party. I am sure the next time an election is held that same trend will be repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard comments this afternoon on the benefits of a fodder scheme. I was also fascinated to read the article by Tim Stevens. Like the Deputy Leader of the National Party, I do not necessarily believe everything that appears in newspapers to be absolute fact, and I acknowledge that. I thought the article by Tim Stevens on 9 September was interesting. He began by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not often that a conservative politician bearing $90 million in gifts is shown the door by farm leaders, yet this was the reaction from coalition backbenchers and the National Farmers Federation to the release of the opposition drought policy last week.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask members to contrast that with the very laudatory and, I might say, well-deserved statements made yesterday by the farming organisations&mdash;not just by the National Farmers Federation but by a range of organisations throughout Australia&mdash;in response to the drought policy. The President of the Grains Council of Australia, Ian MacFarlane, who accompanied the Prime Minister during his visit to the drought ravaged parts of Queensland, last week said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought stricken farmers have been given new hope for the future with today's commitment by the federal government. The Prime Minister and Senator Collins have stood by their commitment to help drought stricken farmers. These commitments, given during recent drought tours, had given the rural community great expectations, which have now been met.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very significant comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the fundamental issue: the benefits of the fodder subsidy. This matter was also raised by Tim Stevens in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 9 September. He gave the policy perspective a real big serve&mdash;he is not the only one. An opposition Senate colleague from Western Australia came to the same conclusion. In a debate in the Senate on 31 August this year, Senator Panizza, a Liberal Party senator from Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the point Senator Collins made about the stupidity of putting subsidy on fodder itself. I confess that I argued against that yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator Collins</EMPHASIS>&mdash;It's got some problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator PANIZZA</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Yes, it has got some problems. I argued against it yesterday because I believe it should go on to freight instead.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that, even amongst their own team, coalition members cannot get their act together. Yet this group of people come in here and suggest that we do not understand the issues that affect rural Australia. It is significant to point out some of those measures in the course of this debate. In my belief, the principal one was the notion of a drought relief payment, which will provide farm families with sufficient cash to be able to purchase the basic necessities of life. I have had drawn to my attention examples&mdash;I am sure honourable members on all sides have had similar examples drawn to their attention&mdash;of often quite embarrassed women from farming communities going to a Social Security office and saying, `For goodness sake, do not tell our husbands we are in here getting some form of welfare assistance.' I have made the point time and again that farmers and their families should be no more embarrassed about accepting social security payments than should a disadvantaged worker in a manufacturing plant in Sydney or Melbourne. They should be no more disadvantaged than anyone else that is there to be captured by the safety net that is social security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real trap has been the assets test, which has been a real barrier to allowing those payments to be accessed. I make no bones about it: I believe this was overdue. That was the reason I felt strongly enough to get up and argue the case in caucus. I was confident that, following recent events in the cabinet, by Senator Collins and more latterly by the Prime Minister, a motion along those lines would enjoy very strong support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important issue. This payment, through the range of measures, will mean that a farmer, his wife and a couple of kids will have upwards of $25,000 a year of disposable income to access during the current severe conditions. I have heard people say that the small business people are doing it tough. I know they are doing it tough on the Darling Downs in the electorate of the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor). A lot of those small businesses, I am sure, have a large amount of money on the tick. Through great personal sacrifice, I am sure, they are carrying a lot of people. This will mean that a lot of farmers will now be able to relieve themselves of that debt and that commitment to a lot of those small business people. Not only will this package address the basic issues of providing the necessities of life to farming families; it will also address the issue of putting $164 million into rural Australia. That is something that should not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of Austudy is equally important because the farm assets test will be removed for all families in exceptionally drought affected areas. The current Austudy income test, which is more generous than that for JSA and the off-farm assets test, will apply. I have no problem with that at all. The last thing we want to happen during current severe drought conditions is for a husband and wife to go through the gut wrenching problem of trying to face their kids and tell them that they cannot afford to keep them at school any longer, particularly those farmers from the more isolated parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many things about this package that time does not permit us to go into this afternoon. But, importantly, if one analyses this package in any constructive form, it is about providing a drought management policy for the future. That is what this has done; it has added to a range of policy initiatives that this government has put into place over a number of years but principally recognises the fact that we are undergoing some quite abnormal situations as far as the weather is concerned. This package will address those issues, not just for the current extreme circumstances. Because of the drought proofing measures that have been flagged by the Prime Minister, this package will also move towards a longer term attitude&mdash;a detailed policy&mdash;that will serve this nation well for the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to start by making a few observations. It is worth noting that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) must have been a bit embarrassed by his comments of a few weeks ago when he dismissed the drought as just being a normal part of agriculture. In fact, he thought so much of it that he could not even be bothered to come into this chamber to make a statement to announce his drought package. Instead, he went off to a press conference yesterday&mdash;interestingly during the middle of question time&mdash;so that he did not have to face some of the opposition members who had to be in the chamber. It is even more interesting that he has left it to two backbenchers to raise the issue in this chamber today. Again, I think that tells us a lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting that the first speaker in this debate, the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), spent 12 of his 15 minutes talking about anything but the package. That is how much he thought about it. It was only in the last three minutes that he actually got around to talking about this package. I guess that shows us that he too knew that this is only a small step in trying to do something to alleviate the extreme hardship that is now gripping so much of country Australia. I thought his comments were damned insulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the thoughts of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson). There was some suggestion that those on this side of the chamber did not know what was going on out in the bush and that the only people the honourable member for Gwydir thought were worth quoting were farm leaders. Let me tell those opposite that there are many people on this side of the chamber, as indeed there are probably many on the government side too, who are well aware, who do not need to read quotes from other people to say that they know what is going on out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we listen to government speakers in this debate, yet again we can see that there is a real lack of understanding about the longer term impact of what this drought is going to do. While I would like to congratulate the government on what it has done, as has been pointed out by the honourable member for Gwydir most of the steps that have been taken in fact were already part of the coalition's policy&mdash;something that it seems the government is too churlish and too small minded to acknowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really disturbs me about the whole approach of this government is the way it seems to have an almost total lack of understanding of the real impact that the drought is going to have on country Victoria. It is all very well to talk about spending money, which is something that the Labor Party loves to do&mdash;it is one of its specialities&mdash;but it has to realise that there is a lot more to this than just spending a bit of money. I will quote from a couple of recent reports to show honourable members just how serious the impact of this drought is. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crop Report</EMPHASIS>, which was put out on 13 September, just over a week ago, by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics makes a terrifying forecast. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a consequence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is the drought obviously&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">total Australian winter crop production is forecast to fall significantly from 28.2 million tonnes last year to less than 16.6 million tonnes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to point out that wheat production is expected to fall by 38 per cent. That is a staggering figure. If you look at this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Commodities</EMPHASIS>, under the heading of `Agriculture overview' it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net value of Australian farm production is forecast to fall by 28 per cent to $2.6 billion in 1994-95&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a 28 per cent fall in production. It is all very well for the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to make some comment about a one quarter of one per cent decrease in the rate of growth. Just think what that means for those who are directly affected. I am not just talking about the farmers; I am talking about those who work in the small businesses in the local communities in the areas that are drought affected. Twenty-eight per cent is a hell of a lot different from one quarter of one per cent. I think this is what the government has failed to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give you an idea of the concern that the Prime Minister really has. I have recently contacted the Prime Minister to try to point out the generosity of some farmers in my electorate and to ask for just a little bit of assistance. Already these farmers, mostly at their own expense or from money they have raised, either in Timboon or through the Lions Club or from some of the drought affected areas in Queensland, have managed to send 21 semi-trailer loads full of donated hay to help feed some of the starving stock. They have waiting there another 60 semi-trailer loads of donated hay to be fed to starving stock. </PARA>

Yet so far the Prime Minister has not even bothered to answer the request for some help with the freight to get that hay to the farmers. These people are fortunate. They are generously trying to do their bit to help. Yet where does this government's package come in to help them? Here is an example of Australians being what Australians really are, and what happens? They are just ignored.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable member for Calare said that the assets test might be eased. Who brought in the assets test in the first place? It was Labor and now you have had to be forced, at a time when people are suffering absolute misery, to realise that maybe you went a little too far, maybe you put people in a position where they could not even afford to send their kids to school unless you did something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talked about the fodder subsidy being discredited. Says who? As my colleague the member for Gwydir has pointed out, there is already a cap on grain prices. They have lifted dramatically already. The point is, what are we going to do about the long-term aspects of agriculture in Australia? In particular, what are we going to do about our breeding herds and flocks of sheep? As has been pointed out, unless we do something about that, the long-term implications for the future of our livestock industries are quite horrifying; in fact, terrifying. </PARA>

In an interview on the first of this month he was asked, `What are you going to do about suspending the assets test while the drought prevails?' His response was, `I think we want to see in the first instance how many farmers are unaware of the existing provisions and try to make sure they are well aware of them.' That is how much concern he had on the first of this month. He was not even prepared to consider assistance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I had more time I would have liked to expand on why farmers are in worse straits than they were in the 1982-83 drought. It boils down to the fact that the government has weakened the farm sector so much over the last few years. We have been through a recession, we have been through the high interest rates, we have seen transport costs rise because of fuel tax, and we have seen the income equalisation deposit scheme callously removed at the critical time when it could have allowed farmers to put some money aside, when there was a bit of money around.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw attention to one of South Australia's tourism attractions that may fall victim to this government's inability to accept responsibility for the consequences of its grandiose promises. The Australian Railway Historical Society of South Australia, better known as Steamranger, runs steam hauled locomotive tourist trains between Adelaide and the coastal town of Victor Harbour. Each year approximately 23,000 passengers travel on the three restored steam engines, making a significant contribution to the region's tourism industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dishing out infrastructure projects in the 1992 One Nation statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) decided to create a standard gauge national rail highway from Brisbane to Perth via Melbourne and Adelaide. When the Adelaide-Melbourne rail line is converted to standard gauge early next year, the Steamranger will be unable to run its broad gauge trains from its Dry Creek depot to Mount Barker, from where it goes on to Goolwa and Victor Harbour. Steamranger has to relocate its depot to Mount Barker to keep operating, and the $2.1 million price tag to do so is proving to be quite an obstacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After pouring millions of dollars into the railway line through the now scrapped Commonwealth employment program and various grants, it would seem natural that the federal government would be eager to assist, if only to protect its investment. But, no, the federal Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has bluntly told the state Minister for Transport, Diana Laidlaw, that the government will not fund such a relocation. The state government is of the view that it is not fair and reasonable for the state to pay for Steamranger's move to Mount Barker, a view consistently held by the previous Labor government. In other words, the contribution this railway makes to the state's tourism industry&mdash;the work of hundreds of volunteers and the millions already spent in developing this attraction&mdash;is now threatened by the uncompromising stand taken by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state government will compromise. It is prepared to make a funding contribution, conditional on Steamranger reducing relocation costs from $2.1 million to $1.126 million and the federal government making a matching contribution. In announcing this assistance, Ms Laidlaw lamented the unfortunate omission by former Premier Bannon and his cabinet colleagues at the time to consider Steamranger's fate when agreeing to the terms of the One Nation funding in 1992. Regrettably, time is now critical in securing funding so that planning can start. I ask why the minister is prepared to offer his Maritime Union mates a $20 million-plus PAYE pay-off to restore harmony rather than genuine reform measures to the international shipping industry yet cannot find any money for Steamranger. It also seems unfair that, although the federal government has helped Steamranger before, it now will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1989 Steamranger's Southern Encounter train service was forced to close when a 32-kilometre section of the track was ruled unsafe. But Steamranger survived. The then federal transport minister announced that Australian National would provide assistance to the value of $100,000 to help restore the track. The then state government committed a one-off grant of $275,000, while Steamranger contributed $225,000 in stocks and funds and raised another $190,000 to complete the restoration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In announcing the grant, the then state tourism minister pointed out that the federal and state governments had contributed grants worth almost $2 million, including the $750,000 to restore the Strathalbyn to Victor Harbour line. But the federal government is now prepared to throw it all away. Understandably, my state colleague Diana Laidlaw has denounced this lack of vision. She wrote to the transport minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aghast and disappointed with the narrow perspective which you have taken on this matter . . . Your decision is reprehensible. It means that the future of this popular, successful tourism venture is in the balance. The potential loss of Steamranger's services is a high price to pay for the standardisation project.</PARA>
<PARA>One must examine the responsibilities that the federal government carries. It must not forget the ramifications on the little people as it enthuses about the big picture. It should not bow to the forces of those unions while ignoring smaller lobby groups like Steamranger, which does not have the clout needed to force results. I join the call of the South Australian transport minister and urge the federal minister to reconsider his non-compromising refusal to support the funding to relocate Steamranger to Mount Barker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to put on record some reference to the death last week of the great philosopher Sir Karl Popper. There are particular reasons for doing that. Popper made very great contributions to world philosophy, most of them in Great Britain but also some significantly in New Zealand. He was brought up and educated in Austria. After Hitler came to power, he went, as a refugee, to New Zealand. In New Zealand he worked at the Canterbury University College at Christchurch. He was the chairman of a very influential committee which was trying to provide placement in New Zealand for refugees from Hitler's Europe. The secretary of the committee was Sir Otto Frankel, a very great plant geneticist, who is still alive and resides here in Canberra. He is 93 years of age, and he was skiing until last year. Together, Popper and Otto Frankel made a very formidable combination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1945, Popper applied for the chair of philosophy at Sydney University. The appointment committee recommended his appointment, but it was then overturned by the members of the university's Senate. Despite all the experience of World War II, despite the fact that it might have been a time for us to say, `We have to be open-minded and open up our society to fresh ideas, fresh challenges,' they said, `No, we want somebody who simply represents the conventional wisdom.' They were not prepared to take on Karl Popper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Karl then went to Britain, where, in rather an unlikely environment, he spent the next 25 years as the professor of philosophy at the London School of Economics. He made it a  very great centre of philosophy. What was particularly important was his impact in thinking about science and about scientific probabilities. I had the great benefit of personal contact with him; I had the opportunity to meet him in Kenley, just outside of London, in July 1988. I knew, and I was very flattered, that he had written a detailed critique of my book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sleepers, Wake!</EMPHASIS>. I spent a very important day talking to this grand old man of philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, Popper's rejection by Sydney University was extremely controversial.

Popper was a great advocate of a fresh approach to things, but he believed you had to challenge them. One of his main arguments was that the confirmation of a theory can never be more than provisional, while its refutation will always be final. He argued that ethical standards are autonomous&mdash;that is, they are not derived from facts&mdash;hence individuals have the right to criticise authorities and institutions. He argued that progress is made possible not by a utopian approach but by readiness to make the best of existing material resources. He also argued that the proponents of an idea must be able to propose methods for testing falsifiability, leading to confirmation or refutation of the hypothesis. That is very important&mdash;perhaps some of our political parties might take it on board as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons he was very critical of Marx, Freud and of some of the religious positions taken was that nobody ever said, `This is my hypothesis but, if you want to test it, this is the way you test it.

The Geelong plant is one of the older plants of the Alcoa group in the world. The price of aluminium has tended to fluctuate from being fairly good to fairly bad over the past 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989 it was clear that, whilst prices were fairly good, changes were needed. The management then started having discussions with its employees to bring about the necessary changes. It was indicated to the staff that the work force would be reduced from 1,000 to 600 but that there would be no sackings. The work force took this as a fair assessment and felt that it would not be let down on the undertaking that the work force would be reduced through natural attrition only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the union leadership of Mr Ted Hardcastle, who was the senior union delegate for the new Federation of Industrial, Manufacturing and Engineering Employees. He was able to persuade his union members that changes were needed, that it was in their own best interests that the plant changed&mdash;that the employees and the unions had to change their attitude&mdash;because he understood that if there was no change by the end of the next four or five years there might not be any jobs at all at Alcoa. There were seven unions in the plant at that time and he persuaded them that it was in their own interests that there be only two unions. In the end the two unions were the FIMEE and the ETU&mdash;the Electrical Trades Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also place on the record the contribution of managing director, Les Davey, who was the driving force in bringing about the new culture, in conjunction with Ted Hardcastle. Les Davey introduced changes to the structure of the company, the strategy, the shared values of management and the work force, the systems, the style of operation, the skills and of course the people involved. As I mentioned before, a trust developed between the Alcoa management and the employees of that plant. This was the framework of change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of unions was reduced, as I mentioned, and this reduced the number of demarcation disputes, which had been endemic in that plant and in other plants in the Geelong region. They annualised the salaries so there was no longer overtime. The arrangement of annualised salaries without overtime encouraged family life; the employees could enjoy a normal 40-hour week and enjoy their family arrangements. There was a teams approach on the plant floor, which I will refer to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the unions, the decisions were made at the workplace, and it is clear that at that plant there was no interference from senior union figures from Sydney or Melbourne. Any possible disputes were solved at the plant level and never got to union discussions. Things like sick leave, holiday pay and family leave were decided by the teams at the workplace. Having annualised salaries meant that the job had to be done on time. There was no incentive to have more overtime, and there was a dramatic change in attitude in terms of quality and results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The teams approach meant there were eight to 12 persons in each team and there was real discussion at the plant level. The quality of the work, the cost of the work and the cooperative approach meant that all personnel in the plant had an objective to make the Alcoa plant more profitable and world competitive. The supervisors were gone, the bosses were gone, and the teams did the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A team member we met said, `When I come to work at 8 o'clock in the morning I am in control of my destiny for the day because I can make real decisions that ensure I do a good day's work. This is worth while.' That was his attitude. It was obvious to the honourable member for Bennelong and myself that all people at the plant were enjoying their work. I compliment the management of Alcoa on an outstanding achievement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;However, the more likely explanation is the Liberal Party, with its typical inefficiency, had not made the document available to its own parliamentary members. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who is now being called `The Thing That Chatters' all over Melbourne, has put his name, literally, to a document that has absolutely no substance to it. It is because the document is so totally bereft of substance that I wonder whether the current Leader of the Opposition actually read the document at all. If he had read The Things That Matter, he would have seen, as most people have, that it contains no detail of substance. The current Leader of the Opposition has openly admitted that in the past he has signed correspondence without actually bothering to read it.

Back in 1944 Menzies said, `A new movement must come into existence unhandicapped by vested political or personal interests of any kind'&mdash;except for Menzies' own interests. The first thing that struck me was that in 1994, some 50 years on, the only thing the current Leader of the Opposition could come up with was that we need a government which works for all Australians, not just some special interest groups. After 50 years the Liberals cannot think of an original word to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing to strike me was the intention to create a department of the family with a minister who would be a cabinet minister. There are only so many ministers available. If a new ministry is created, which ministry will be abolished? Which one will it be? There is no doubt in my mind that the Leader of the Opposition intends to abolish the ministry of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. In The Things That Matter, reference was made to the government's so-called centralised bureaucratic approach to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs. I refer to the policy position of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, an organisation of which the current Leader of the Opposition was previously the director. This organisation, as set out in the publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mandate to govern</EMPHASIS>, advocates the abolition of the department of Aboriginal affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing that struck me about The Things That Matter was that it contains a subliminal support for citizen initiated referenda.

I conclude by making an appeal to the Liberal Party powerbrokers sitting in their leather armchairs in the Melbourne Club: this time, choose someone who at least reads what they sign. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has had many calls from constituents who have been badly affected by the present drought, which is raging in my electorate. The price of ASW wheat, which is used for feeding sheep, is $202 a tonne. That is very expensive indeed. On top of that cost are freight costs incurred in getting wheat to the property, and fuel and labour costs incurred in getting it out to the stock. Some growers are very frustrated. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, around the Parkes area the typical call I am getting is from people who say, `I delivered the wheat to the silo at the end of last year for about half the price that I have to buy it back for now. That wheat has not moved out of the silo. I can still see the silo from my kitchen window. Why can't I buy it at a lower price? Why can't the government give me some assistance in that regard?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An elderly couple from Coolabah, which is a very small town halfway between Nyngan and Bourke in my electorate, rang me and gave me all their details relating to this issue and said that I could use them publicly as an example. They are a 65-year-old couple who would normally be looking at winding down and retiring at this stage of life. But they have to put off their only farm assistant. They have 30,000 acres and run 8,000 sheep on their property. They are feeding out 10 tonnes of wheat a week to keep 6,000 of their sheep alive. The other 2,000 are wethers, and the couple are letting them take their chances. That couple are outlaying well in excess of $2,000 a week just to keep the sheep alive in the hope that they will make it through to January when they will be sheared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The couple have to haul that wheat from the silos at Narromine, which is a 500 kilometre round trip. It is costing them $20 a tonne just for the freight. The state government returns half of that&mdash;$10 a tonne&mdash;to them. They have joined 4,000 ewes this year and they reckon that they will be lucky to get 200 lambs at marking time. They have put in 900 acres of oats, which did not even come up through the ground. They have prepared the land for another 1,500 acres of wheat. Fortunately they did not plant it, so they did not have the extra expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of their neighbours cannot afford this outlay every week, and their sheep are starting to die. If this drought goes on for much longer, the cacophony of voices calling for some type of assistance to be able to have the wherewithal to purchase fodder of one sort or another to keep stock alive will become much greater than it has been to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative which the government is putting&mdash;it keeps quoting the NFF's position on this&mdash;is to do nothing. I ask the government, the NFF and the other farm bodies&mdash;the few farm bodies that have opposed this&mdash;what they are going to be advocating in a month from now, in six weeks from now or, heaven forbid, in six months from now if it has not rained by then. It is already very difficult to find hay in this country, though some should start to come through from the end of next month when, in irrigated areas, hopefully the first cuts of lucerne will be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of great concern, which I have raised in question time twice this week, is interest rates. The example I raised in question time was that of an average couple paying about $50,000 from the recent three-quarters of one per cent rise, most of which seems to have flowed through. The proposed one per cent rise that is highly likely to come through before Christmas will add $6,000 to $8,000 to the interest bills of those people. The interest rate rises alone will more than wipe out the present drought package which has been offered&mdash;as welcome as that is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the government consider doing other things. There are people out there who cannot even make an untimed telephone call to their local neighbour. They are on the pastoral rate and they get charged 25c, or whatever it is, every 4 1/2 minutes. Women who would like to ring up their neighbour and have a chat for half an hour just to regain their sanity are very conscious of this charge and are reluctant to make such calls. If the government could see fit to make moves in this direction, it would be very welcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of honourable members the achievements of students of the Kingscliff High School in my electorate of Richmond. Kingscliff High was recently announced the winner of the 1994 national Enviroquest, a competition run in August by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Not only was Kingscliff High the winner, but it filled the first three places in the competition from some 40 high schools across New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Enviroquest ran over two weeks. It focused on two unique regions of Australia&mdash;the Murray-Darling and the Great Barrier Reef. High schools across the country participated through the Key Link electronic mail network, with teams presented with an environmental problem relating to each of the regions. As they were given more clues, they had to work out what the problem was and offer ways to overcome it. Points were awarded for speed of response as well as for the quality of responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the winner, Kingscliff High was given the opportunity to present to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) an environmentally based submission. On Tuesday I had the pleasure of presenting the minister with that submission. It focused on the creation of a classroom powered by alternative energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal&mdash;I have a copy of the submission here&mdash;involves powering a classroom through alternative energy, in this case solar power. The classroom would be powered by three solar panels which would feed into a battery bank inside the classroom. The students have calculated that three solar panels would be sufficient. A large display meter would be put into place so that the students would be able to monitor the amount of power being generated and that which was consumed. They would also be able to calculate the costs of the power they were generating and consuming. This is a practical way of teaching the importance of energy consumption and the need to develop alternative energy supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Enviroquest is the most recent in a string of environmental successes for Kingscliff High since the school's Enviro Club was established some six years ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The club was formed by teacher Peter Langley, who has been the driving force behind the club and has been responsible for the projects undertaken by the club. The club has taken out awards such as the New South Wales Landcare Award, the ABC National Earthworm Award, the Victorian Banksia Award and the Landcare video awards. The school is also a four-time winner of the Griffith University High School Environment Award. It is not the awards that are important, it is the dedication and commitment of the students to making a positive contribution towards their local environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The students are currently ridding lantana from some nine hectares of littoral rainforest behind the school and are developing an outdoor classroom. That will be used by the schools from around the district for educational purposes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the pleasure of meeting four members of the Enviro Club who presented me with their submission last Friday week. I was impressed with their enthusiasm for what they were doing and for their awareness of the local environment. The four students that I met with&mdash;Mitchell Bryant, Misty King, Andrew Drury and Nathan Wright&mdash;were very enthusiastic about the project and also about why they picked an energy efficient classroom. One other student, Lara Maciuk, played a major role in preparing the submission but was attending the Youth Earth Symposium on the Gold Coast and was not able to be present when the submission was presented to me. The preamble to the submission states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I acknowledge the government's consideration in allowing me to continue with my remarks in the debate on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 and cognate bills. I was at the stage of talking about drought proofing of properties. Bearing in mind that this is a most dreadful drought that we are having in Australia currently, I think that for the future the government will certainly need to look at drought proofing measures and taxation benefits that may be applicable to the farming community to enable it to take a lot of the preventative measures that are required to ensure that a property remains viable during what we are seeing as an extreme drought throughout Australia. Instances of these measures are on-farm water storage, on-farm grain storage and land improvements to overcome any degradation of the land that might occur as a result of the drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the landcare program has been especially effective in my electorate, areas of which have been amongst the leaders in landcare measures. They certainly have put those programs to very effective use. The government will need to look at putting in place funding arrangements and taxation benefits that will in fact drought proof a lot of properties throughout Australia. In approaching this matter of drought relief in a bipartisan manner, there is a need for permanent provisions by the government&mdash;irrespective of who happens to be in government&mdash;for drought, so that people know precisely what their benefits are and know, before they get into a situation of extreme drought, that there will be assistance, cooperation and guidelines firmly in place that can be brought into play if such a drought should occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly recall the situation in Victoria, when we went through a disastrous drought in 1982, and the ramifications of that and of the Ash Wednesday fires. After the fires had subsided and the extent of the damage had been assessed, the Victorian state government at the time embarked on a wide ranging program of counterdisaster measures which they put in place through legislation. Those provisions have remained in place since that time. People need to know that, if they are affected by drought or by fire, there are guidelines to assist them in understanding what relief will be made available by the government. We need to ensure that there is an understanding by people in the rural community and by other people affected by natural disasters that there is something there to assist them in each particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely vital that we ensure that people in the rural community are looked after in cases of drought, because they are one of the major export earners in Australia and they produce a lot of Australia's wealth. We have a very good reputation for the cleanliness of our agricultural product, and that reputation has spread throughout the world. People acknowledge that food produced in Australia by our rural community is in fact clean: it is acceptable worldwide, and Australia has an extremely good food production reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the proper drought relief measures are not in place, we are in serious danger of losing many of our good farmers. There has been a movement away from rural pursuits in recent years where young people have chosen to leave the farm and take up other careers. The average age of people farming in Australia has increased. We are in danger of losing even more young people from the farming community as a result of the ravages of this drought, which extends throughout Queensland and New South Wales, and now southerly down into Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that drought affects everyone is borne out by what happened during the 1982 drought. Drought affects the farmers who are producing the food, it affects small business around the towns which support the rural communities, and it ultimately flows on to large business throughout capital cities. That was never more evident than during the 1982 drought. I am sure that in Queensland and New South Wales people would also be feeling the impact now in the small business communities, and it would be flowing on into Sydney and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farms are not producing anything. The land is ravaged by the weather and is degraded as a result, and a lot of the topsoil is lost. People are placed in a situation where they have to face up to the elements and the deterioration of their farm property. For financial or physical reasons many of them are forced to give up and leave the farm. We have lost many good farmers as a result. Just the same, in small towns the mainstays of those communities&mdash;the small businesses&mdash;are affected. They provide goods and services to the farming community and are unable to withstand the economic and social trauma that is handed down through the deterioration of the farming pursuits. People lose their economic and social viability in those towns and they leave. Then, because of the declining population, government services are withdrawn. Many small towns are shrinking as a result of the impact of the drought we are going through now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those effects flow on to larger cities. Following the 1982 drought Melbourne was inundated with people who had left rural communities and had gone to Melbourne seeking employment. There is an impact on the economic activity in capital city areas because most of the manufacturers are based in the metropolitan area. Some of the large agricultural manufacturing enterprises are operating in those areas and they are seriously affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on the relationship between the present drought and the difficulties that we are experiencing, and the need to put something permanently in place that will provide guidelines for the rural community in this great time of need. There are a number of parallels between our policy and the government's policy. I want to enumerate some of those. The parallels between the two policies include the provision of immediate farm family income support. This is absolutely vital. The coalition makes provision for support through a revamped farm household support scheme and the suspension of the assets test on welfare payments, the government via its new drought relief payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also improved access to Austudy for children from farm families in drought areas by exempting them from the on-farm assets test for this benefit. One thing that would exacerbate the tragedy of a drought would be if children, through economic necessity, were withdrawn from their studies. Further parallels involve greater flexibility and increased funding under the rural adjustment scheme for farmers experiencing drought in exceptional circumstances and the provision of assistance through the rural adjustment scheme for up to 12 months after the drought breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is important because the ramifications of the drought go on, even after it has rained, because of the deterioration of the land. A lot of the topsoil, a lot of trees and a lot of native grasses are lost when it does rain, particularly if there is a heavy downpour. We need to be able to rehabilitate the land and to make sure that the land becomes viable in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certainly not condemning what the government has done. I think that it has met some of the concerns of the rural community but I am concerned that the package did nothing for small business operators in many of those drought areas because their cash flow has been absolutely decimated. We can understand that people in the farming community are going through this dreadful time when they do not have any income. There is additional pressure on small business operators who are providing them with goods and services to sustain them on the farm in the hope that the rural seasons will improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the government could have looked at providing some form of package to small business in many of those rural areas where they are servicing the farming community. Many of those small businesses will be facing a dreadful time at the moment because, whilst the income support to the families is very much welcomed, it will only be enough to sustain those families. There will not be much left after that to provide for additional services and goods from small businesses in the area and, of course, that will affect their viability. I do have some very serious concerns about the impact of the drought on small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A solution could have been achieved by returning severe or exceptional drought to the natural disaster relief arrangements and that would have given small business and farmers access to long-term concessional loans. I know that a loan still has to be paid back but, if it were a reasonably attractive loan on a long-term basis, interest repayments would be easier for those small businesses and it might help some of them to overcome the effects of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to speak both before and after the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) made his announcement and I do welcome the provisions that have been made. I do not believe that drought relief should be a political issue between parties. I think that what we should be trying to do is to arrive at a bipartisan position where there are strong guidelines in place. Farmers should know what the rules of the game are if a drought descends upon them. They should know that there is provision on an ongoing basis to help them not only for the drought period but also for a period of time after the drought so that they can rehabilitate the land and get it back into full production again. I think the government should now be looking at providing long-term benefits to the farming community, particularly to farmers who want to try to drought proof their property or to make provisions for it. I know the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Adams) would appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst Tasmania is not in the grip of this drought, there are some areas that are affected. It is probably not a drought by outback Queensland and outback New South Wales standards but certainly there has been a lower level of production for them. The member would understand that there is a need for an ongoing provision of measures for farmers, particularly in the area of drought proofing of properties. The tax benefits that might be given to farmers allow them to provide a bit of insulation against the ravages of the drought that we are currently going through. I believe the important thing is the need for long-term planning to ensure that farmers are kept on the farm. Farmers are one of the major economic stimulants to the economy and, of course, one of our greatest export earners. Their expertise should not be lost to the Australian community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It has many parts to it and it deals with many amendments to many of the acts dealing with rural industries. I certainly support the government's amendments to the bill, which do some tidying up work. I am opposed to the opposition's amendment, which has now been made redundant by the government's announcement yesterday in relation to assisting rural Australia in dealing with the drought issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I basically want to support and speak about the wine industry. At the request of the wine industry, the bills allow a levy to be raised so that we can look at marketing, which includes wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program&mdash;which is so important in making sure we have integrity in all of our industries and in quality control&mdash;and how we describe Australian wine. These bills work through these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the research component. The Wine and Brandy Corporation has a statutory responsibility to coordinate and fund research and development undertaken on behalf of the industry. The government provides matching funds for this expenditure on a dollar for dollar basis. In other words, the government recognises that, although the industry is an expanding one and quite lucrative, there is a great deal of research and development needed to ensure the viability and continuing success of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also ends the exemption that smaller winemakers, those processing less than 10 tonnes of product, had from paying a levy. As non-payers, they had no recognition in the decisions and operations of the corporation and its regulatory functions, nor were they able to seek specific assistance with research that involves the smaller wine grower. In the area where I come from in Tasmania there are small producers on small blocks. They sometimes miss out on the research opportunities from government agricultural departments and state departments. I think they also miss out on the research done in the bigger areas on how we are structuring research in the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a small annual fee that constitutes the minimum levy rate, smaller winemakers will have the right to represent their interests at the annual general meetings and to receive services and information from the corporation. Some of the smaller winemakers rely on larger winemakers to process grapes and to convert them into wine under instructions for a fee. The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker to market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is seen as the producer and is liable for a levy on the wine. This cost is added to the fee charged to smaller winemakers making them pay for the levy anyway but without being able to attend, debate or vote in the industry's meetings. The act allows all winemakers to participate fully in the decision making of their industry. Many small producers will not be exporters, but the changes to the domestic market directly affect them and it is important for them to have their say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Winemaking is becoming a very important industry in Australia. Annual production of beverage wine is about 450 million litres, from 600,000 to 700,000 tonnes of wine grapes. The gross value of production of wine grapes is approximately $300 million, and the gross value of wine sales is about $1,200 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine grapes are grown in all states of Australia, with South Australia, of course, being the main producing state. There are about 4,000 grape growers supplying about 700 wineries. This industry is a very successful value adding export industry, with exports having grown from 11 million litres&mdash;worth $21 million&mdash;in 1985-86, to 103 million litres&mdash;worth $293 million&mdash;in 1992-93, and an estimated $394 million in 1993-94.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports now account for over a quarter of production. The industry has set a target for exports of $1 billion per annum by the year 2000&mdash;a very big ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our main markets, by volume, are the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Sweden, the United States, Canada and Japan. Figures are now showing that the world wine market is saturated. In 1992, the world wine production of 29.4 billion litres exceeded consumption, which was 23 billion litres. But Australia's position in the cleaner southern hemisphere, Australia's quest for the high quality market and the fact that our wines are fruity and affordable have ensured a firm demand in the world picture. Other countries are a little nervous for their industries, as Australia's wine is beginning to be seen by connoisseurs as being in the premier league. I am sure you would agree with that, Mr Deputy Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is benefiting from the interest of wine producers. There are 59 registered wine growers in Tasmania, and there may be a few more growing grapes as a hobby. They are spread all over the state and grow a wide variety of grapes. The Tasmanian industry is relatively young, apart from our veteran wine grower, Claud Alcorso, who started making wine as a hobby after being told that basically he could not grow grapes in Tasmania. He now has a very successful industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is surprising that Tasmania was slower than other states to see the potential. I think that people did not realise that our climate is very similar to those of Rome and south-western Spain, where there is plenty of wine grown. But it may also have something to do also with the excellent Cascade and Boags beers that have been brewed for over 100 years in Tasmania. Perhaps old habits die hard in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in 1992-93 Tasmania produced 1,087 tonnes of grapes, half of which were red and half of which were white, giving Tasmania a chance for a nice range of table wines. We are certainly catching up now to some of the levels of the wines of the other states. Although we will probably never get to the same levels of production as exist in other states, because of our size, I think we can continue to produce first class wines and fit into our niche markets. I have noticed that Tasmania's wines have been seen in many mainland shows and are winning prizes across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as in all primary industries, there are many pitfalls. Unless smaller growers have access to marketing skills and research and development expertise, competition for export markets may soon see a promising industry fail. Levies are seen as an insurance. They are the safeguard to ensure that winemaking prospers, and that Australia is competing in its own right in what has been seen in the past as a European monopoly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also deals with the Farm Household Support Act of 1992 and tidies up some matters in relation to that. The previous speaker, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid), mentioned the drought issues and did touch on Tasmania. Some parts of my electorate are having a very tough time and, though conditions are not as severe as in western Queensland, where I spent some of my youth, or New South Wales, there are areas around St Marys and on the lower east coast and into the southern midlands of Tasmania which are extremely dry and where production levels are down. So any of the farmers in those areas would possibly have the opportunity of getting the benefit of some of the government's drought relief measures announced yesterday. </PARA>

I know the Farmers Federation in Tasmania is working very hard with its landcare officer to get farmers onto a whole farm management approach, and it has set some very ambitious time spans for that. The idea is to get farmers to look at their water catchment, at what coverage of trees and shrubbage exists within the farm, and to look at the farm as a whole and not one part of it at a time. We really come back to what we call sustainability, in getting agriculture to a sustainable situation. Of course, droughts and downturns in the rural area affect small towns. They have affected some of the areas in my electorate, and any assistance that we can get to some of our people will also sustain those small towns.

<PARA>The Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill makes a number of `technical' amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act. Broadly, these amendments will allow better management, focus and control in relation to approved joint venture and consortium, and approved trading houses; give greater promotional focus to certain expenditure; and provide Austrade with the power to introduce and administer a system of accreditation for export grants consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Included under the scheme since 1990-91, as single entity claimants, have been groupings of exporters known as approved joint venture and approved consortium. This facility allows exporters to present a group approach to markets where their aggregation of effort can demonstrate advantages over single supplier promotion. The advantage for exporters is that they remain as individuals for all other purposes under the EMDG scheme, including the ability to receive grants in their own right for their other export promotional endeavours. The facility is project based, and is at the discretion of Austrade within the confines of the act, and ministerially approved guidelines. Approved trading houses are individual entities, which, by virtue of their international network and trading expertise, are able to assist the promotion of the product of exporters who lack the funds and ability to undertake EMDG eligible promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently Austrade has only 30 days in which to make all of the inquiries necessary to a decision whether or not to grant approved joint venture-consortium status, or approved trading house status. This period, in many instances, has proved too short to allow for consideration of all the facts. A period of 60 days should overcome this barrier to good decision making whilst, at the same time, not unduly delaying the processing of applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given approved status, it is important that the entity may be monitored for adherence to the conditions of approval. The act is deficient in regard to providing Austrade with the power to reconsider approved status in the light of subsequent unsatisfactory performance, or where guidelines have been amended to reflect changed government attitude. This bill rectifies the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general limit to the number of EMD grants receivable by claimants is eight. With the focus of approval for joint venture-consortium being project specific, rather than the broad scope of activity afforded other categories of claimant, and in the light of experience, the control provided by this bill in limiting the life of approved joint venture-consortium to a three- to five-year range is seen as an important administrative control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In lieu of non-claimable accommodation, entertainment and sustenance expenses, the scheme provides an eligible expenditure allowance of $200 per day&mdash;maximum of 21 days per overseas trip. Currently, this allowance is assessed on the basis of the prime and principal purpose of the totality of trip, rather than focusing on the actual time devoted to eligible promotional activity. This bill, on the one hand, eliminates the possibility of the scheme supporting overseas vacations and, on the other hand, does not eliminate from grants consideration those exporters who may wish to undertake limited promotional activity whilst overseas primarily for other reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are a number of consultants who provide a service to EMDG claimants with respect to the preparation and lodgment of claims. In 1992-93, over 50 per cent of claims were lodged through, or with the assistance of, consultants. As part of Austrade's enhancement of EMDG risk management, accreditation will provide a mechanism for improving the accuracy of lodged claims, thereby freeing some investigatory resources for use elsewhere within the scheme. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the opportunity to address the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill 1994. Once more, there are amendments to this legislation. It is noteworthy that since 1988 there have been seven amendments to the parent act, and this is the eighth, making this probably one of the most amended pieces of legislation coming before this parliament. At an average of more than one amendment per year over the last few years, I hardly think that the government has grounds for self-congratulation, since I also note that by and large the amendments that have been introduced have been administrative, aimed at tightening up provisions that have been open to abuse. This current round of amendments is of a similar ilk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that members should not be unmindful of the fact that for each and every amending bill to go through the parliament, there is a cost tag of about $1 million&mdash;that is, by dividing the total cost of operation of the federal parliament by the pieces of legislation, amending legislation and acts of parliament that pass in the course of each 12-month period. Therefore, there is an obligation on government to be conscious of a need to approach the whole process of amending legislation on a very sensible basis, and on an efficient basis, so that it is not coming forward constantly with amendments, but so that some effort is made to group those, and to provide that the legislation in its original form is correct in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These constant reviews and changes to the scheme do not really provide a stable and secure environment for exporters. Nevertheless, we are not intending to oppose this amending legislation to this scheme, because it represents access to grants for businesses that might not otherwise qualify, and it does tighten procedures, which, by extension, may well result in savings that can be passed on to other small exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is probably no coincidence that the amendments now before us, which impact upon grants to approved trading houses and approved joint ventures, follow on the heels of the effort of the Australian National Audit Office on the export market development grants scheme&mdash;which, I might add, was a scheme found to be wanting. This raises another question: what other shortcomings in the legislation are only revealed by detailed examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before&mdash;and I am not averse to repeating myself&mdash;it is time for this piece of legislation to be completely overhauled and for there to be a total redrafting. This should be originated, not in the rarefied environment of Austrade, but in an environment that permits the fullest and widest consultation between the interested parties, as well as with the ANAO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is important for this legislation to give more substantive guarantees that it is comprehensive and fulfils the needs of the export sector, while at the same time protecting the tax dollar from improper application. While I am advocating a review of legislation, I would also advocate the need for Austrade itself to be the subject of a total efficiency audit. The McKinsey report on emerging exporters, when it was brought down some time ago, was not a testament to the efficiency of Austrade. It has been 10 years since the practices of Austrade were the subject of scrutiny by the ANAO, and I fail to see why this has not been remedied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the extent of legislative amendment does nothing to contribute to the confidence of the business community in the overall Austrade act. Indeed, the constant change that has been a feature of this piece of legislation may well contribute to greater business uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of registration of consultants, I support the addition of provisions that will more effectively regulate the standard of consultants engaged in the preparation of EMDG claims on behalf of business. A provision such as this is long overdue. It will hopefully speed up the process of claim examination by the department and reduce delays in the delivery of grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the intention of the amendment to tie grants more closely to actual promotional activity being undertaken overseas and to clarify with greater precision the conditions under which the grant will be paid. Again, I make the observation: why was this not previously addressed? I find it extraordinary that it needed an audit by the ANAO to bring about a tightening up on some of these provisions. Had it not been for the audit, I can only assume that this provision and those previously referred to relating to grants would otherwise have continued when clearly they were inappropriate. Why else would the legislation be subject to amendment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the government's overall approach to international trade is less than adequate. And while the export market development grants scheme probably offers some assistance to exporters, the government's longer term strategies are floundering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's self-congratulation on its trade figures is a sham. We all know what the picture is: imports up, exports down. The minister is not averse to quoting figures on the success of Australia's export drive. But when we analyse the figures a very different picture emerges. The fact is that whilst the government proclaims the Asia-Pacific as Australia's most significant market, in reality our exports are losing market share. Note that I said `market share'; I did not say `volume' because one would expect the volume to be increasing, particularly as we are caught in the slipstream of growth that is taking place in the Asian region with the ASEAN economic tigers, north-east Asia and elsewhere. It is clear that our exporters are by degrees sticking in a rut and it is for government to facilitate export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is more to come. How can the government take any comfort from the recent report of the APEC eminent persons group? Our only claim to fame from the report is that it expresses a direction towards free trade. It is motherhood stuff, pure and simple. Of course, free trade on a sensible basis is a desirable end, but the question is how it is to be achieved. The report sheds no light on that at all, but it certainly does not close the door on some sort of discriminatory trade block. I suggest to the government that it read the small print with all of the aspects of APEC and the APEC eminent persons group report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of our trading effort, a whole lot more effort is required. I remind the chamber that, in the case of Malaysia, our trade has increased in volume&mdash;I fully acknowledge that&mdash;but it has increased in minuscule proportions to the huge growth in the Malaysian economy. As a consequence our market share of Malaysian trade has fallen by some 10 per cent. In other words, Australia is not cutting the mustard with regard to its actual trade performance in maintaining market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand is a case in point. New Zealand is niche market exporting to a great deal of Asia, south Asia, greater Asia and the Middle East, in a way which is taking the fight to our products more than I care to admit. New Zealand has of course done a great deal of industrial relations reform, taxation reform and waterfront reform and is extremely competitive in traditional Australian markets. I acknowledge that New Zealand has been out there securing market share, increasing market share in these dynamic economies of greater Asia and indeed right over in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always a need to be cautious when giving anecdotal evidence and comment on matters relating to trade. Nevertheless, it has to be said that it is disappointing to walk into supermarket after supermarket in the Middle East to find that it is New Zealand product which is up in lights, New Zealand dairy product which is dominating the shelves and being given the priority. You then have to search for the Australian product around the corner at the bottom of the next shelf in a way which is a matter of very real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there can be no complacency with Australia's trading effort. The coalition does not oppose the amendments before this chamber but I make the point that more work needs to be done with regard to Austrade, with regard to EMDG, and more work needs to be done to ensure that Australia maintains its market share in these growing Asian economies because we have been slipping behind in terms of market share in Indonesia, Malaysia and other Asian countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make one final point. I recognise that the government has been attempting to bolster its trading efforts to the Asian-Pacific region of the world. I want to remind the government that that ought to be done as an effort additional to all other trading efforts, not in place of them. For example, there is eastern Europe, which I know is of interest to some members as a potential expanded trading area for Australia, southern Europe and the North American markets. We should be opening up markets in South America and the Indian rim, which itself is an area of great potential. I fully support efforts to bolster our trading performance and increase our market share into the Asian countries particularly, the ASEAN countries, north-east Asia, south Asia and India and the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should all be additional to our trading efforts in other regions in the world. Australia is a trading nation. By and large, it can be proud of its efforts. It can be proud of the decision taken in 1957 by John McEwen, minister for trade in the government of the day, to jump the gun and open up a trade treaty with Japan. At the time, this was done to the bitter opposition of the RSL but he showed real leadership in putting the framework approach and the facilitation that is government's role with regard to trade between Australia and Japan. This event in the 1950s underpinned huge developments such as Queensland coal, Western Australian iron ore and a raft of other activities and led to Japan being Australia's largest trading partner today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add that Australia and Indonesia must not be distracted by those elements which would seek to jeopardise a normal bilateral relationship and a warm bilateral relationship between our two countries. Indonesia is our largest neighbour. It is food for thought that those elements here in Australia which pursue certain agendas&mdash;and I respect their right to demonstrate, even their right to demonstrate this day&mdash;have led to the circumstance where it is now 19 years since the president of our nearest neighbour has visited this country. That in itself has a spill-over effect on the dynamic of the bilateral relationship and the underpinning of the trading effort of private enterprise in both directions between Australia and Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that the Vice-President of Indonesia is visiting Australia at this time. I believe that, if the President of Indonesia finds himself able to visit Australia after this long gap, that too would be greatly appreciated. Whilst I do not approve for one moment of all that has happened in relation to East Timor over the years, I recognise the circumstances of the viewpoint of the government and the coalition with regard to East Timor overall. I say that Australia and Indonesia must have a strong bilateral relationship underpinned by a wide degree of contact, not just in the political realm&mdash;and recently senior ministers visited Canberra&mdash;not just in the business realm, with the further development of business council contact between Australia and Indonesia; but also in the cultural realm and right across the spectrum. Our two countries in this corner of the world have much to gain from a purposeful bilateral relationship underpinning expanded trading for the better standard of living of people both in Indonesia and in Australia. The coalition is not then opposed to the amending bill before the House, but I do stand by my comments of concern over the efficiency of Austrade and the need continually to amend its parent legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are here today to debate the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill of 1994. This bill makes a number of minor technical amendments, which I will come to later. I would first like to make some comments on the scheme itself. The Export Market Development Grants Act of 1974 contains provisions which govern the method of application and eligibility for grants, a list of claimable export oriented expenditure, and mechanisms for the review of decisions, the recovery of overpayments and the termination of grant entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants or EMDG scheme, which is administered under that act, provides taxable cash grants of up to $250,000 per annum&mdash;$500,000 for approved trading houses&mdash;and is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets. Provided a person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, that person will be entitled to a grant. A grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. Claimants who have received eight or more grants are not allowed to receive further grants, and claimants who have received at least two prior grants are subject to a performance test which is assessed against export earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eligible expenditure includes such things as up-front marketing costs, travel expenses, special promotional literature and overseas representation. The Australian Trade Commission, Austrade, which administers the EMDG scheme, considers the main benefits of the scheme to include the points that grant funding is guaranteed by legislation, the grant is cash in hand, and the grant directly supports the majority of expenditure categories likely to be incurred by an exporter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme has been successful. It was a scheme which was first established 20 years ago by the Whitlam Labor government. The results achieved by programs such as EMDG, both in Australia and overseas, prove that governments can forge partnerships of mutual benefit with enterprises and, in doing so, can create jobs and a more positive export environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, Austrade received 2,473 EMDG claims with a value of $181 million for the 1991-92 grant year. This compared with 2,002 EMDG claims with a value of $143 million for the 1990-91 grant year. Around 96 per cent of the EMDG claims in 1991-92 were processed by Austrade before 30 June 1992. In the 1993 financial year, the EMDG scheme assisted 3,250 enterprises seeking export markets by providing about $195 million in taxable grants. These grants helped reimburse the marketing and promotional expenses of firms which are trading in some of the world's most competitive markets, in particular in Asia. The number of claimants last year was up by 31 per cent on the previous year. This indicates that more Australian companies are taking up the export challenge and looking for export opportunities to expand their businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme has been successful, and this was confirmed recently in an evaluation report entitled `Helping to meet the export challenge'. As the report shows, most EMDG claimants&mdash;some 70 per cent&mdash;are small to medium sized firms: those with less than $5 million in turnover a year, exports of less than $1 million, and/or fewer than 26 employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is consistent with the findings of the 1993 Australian Manufacturing Council-McKinsey report into manufacturing exporters and the LEK service export study. Both studies report a trend towards smaller, innovative enterprises taking up the call to export. The number of service companies claiming EMDG is growing, and is currently at 45 per cent of all grants; with manufacturers at 37 per cent, traders 15 per cent and primary producers three per cent. However, the McKinsey report also highlighted the fact that there remains a real challenge to further increase the number of Australian manufacturers who are exporting. It is found that up to 90 per cent of Australian manufacturing companies do not export to any significant extent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the more pleasing findings of the EMDG evaluation is that enterprises receiving grants have a higher commitment to exporting, in terms of employment and investment in export activities, than non-EMDG participants. On average, about half the employment of EMDG recipients is export-related. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EMDG also plays an important role in encouraging recipients to seek out new export markets. Research shows the EMDG claimants actually increase their own spending on export market promotion by more than the value of their grant. This additional spending and activity, according to the evaluation committee, results in more exports. A very important point is that the typical `mature' EMDG exporter generates additional exports of up to 15 to 25 times the value of the grant received. In other words, for every dollar that EMDG provides to mature exporters, an additional $15 to $25 is generated in export income. This is certainly good news in terms of the balance of payments and, most importantly, in terms of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important as it is, the EMDG scheme is only one small aspect of a complex array of policies and programs in, for example, education, training and science; macro- and micro-economic management; and trade diplomacy and facilitation. The government's basic domestic trade industry strategy has been, and continues to be, to ensure that these policies work together to provide an economic environment that will enable Australian industry to be competitive and to maximise our export performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's white paper on employment and growth, Working Nation, represents the next step. It contains measures to promote research and innovation, to improve access to finance and capital, to encourage investment, to reduce the administrative burden of government regulations, to enhance labour force flexibility and to improve the skills base of the nation. Most of the measures announced in Working Nation will be of particular benefit to small and medium-sized businesses, because that is where the potential for jobs and new growth is greatest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular set of issues that I want to mention briefly is aimed at strengthening the integration of trade and industry policy and program delivery. At the policy level, the Board of Industry, Trade and Investment, comprising the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook), has been established to coordinate the development of strategies for trade and investment promotion, export facilitation and industry development. One of the government's primary concerns is to ensure that industry development and trade facilitation programs are delivered to industry and business effectively and seamlessly, with the maximum of impact and at the least cost to the taxpayer and the minimum of inconvenience to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also announced in Working Nation the extension of the EMDG scheme for a further five years, thereby providing assistance to, ultimately, about 5,000 exporters a year. Its expansions provide export marketing assistance to single service tourism operators and assistance for offshore marketing activities by providing low interest finance through ITES, the international trade enhancement scheme, for a further four years at $50 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the amendments themselves that are contained within this bill, the question arises of joint venture and consortia and trading houses, which are limited to a lifespan of three years unless they are renewed. Currently, once approved, a JVC or TH can exist forever, as long as it continues to meet the original eligibility criteria. The three-year lifespan introduces an automatic review every three years to ensure that the JVCs meet changing market and government requirements. Austrade is also able to respond appropriately to any new considerations that may arise. If the joint venture is continuing to meet the criteria in the guidelines, it would be expected that re-approval would be automatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">JVCs are limited to a maximum of five grants. Currently, they are treated in the same way as independent claimants are, and may claim up to eight grants. JVCs are generally project specific, with a time duration of less than eight years. It was never intended that they be eligible for eight grants, and it is inconsistent with the nature of them, particularly as members are able to claim up to eight grants independently. The joint venture provisions give companies additional access to EMDG. Austrade would expect that, after five years, companies would have had time to develop the capacity to claim as individual claimants. They also believe that to give companies potentially 16 years in the scheme through the operation of the joint venture provisions is excessive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been an extension in the time allowed for Austrade to seek information in relation to an application for an approved JVC or TH status from 30 days to 60 days. Austrade has found that, with the rush of claims at the end of the claim year, the existing 30 days is often not enough time to analyse what information may be needed to assess an application. This extension of time will allow for better decision making. If an application is complete, Austrade will be required to give an answer within 90 days, as is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If applications are lodged well in advance of the claim, Austrade will be able to deal with the matter more expeditiously. Austrade's experience is that neither of these assumptions can be relied on. The extension of time from 120 days&mdash;that is, the existing 30 days plus 90 days&mdash;to 150 days, being the extension of 60 plus 90, is a maximum only. It is expected that the vast majority of well prepared applications will be dealt with well within the time limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade may also apply new ministerial guidelines to existing JVCs and THs. There is currently conflicting legal opinion about whether Austrade can apply new ministerial criteria to an approved JVC or TH and cancel them if they do not comply. This section clarifies the intention and will enable Austrade to ensure that JVCs continue to meet government objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overseas visits allowance is calculated on a daily basis under this new proposal. EMDG currently allows $200 per day as claimable expenses while on an overseas trip that is primarily for business purposes. However, Austrade is obligated to reimburse all the days of a trip where the purpose of the trip is primarily for business promotional purposes, including recreation days, and cannot reimburse business promotional days where that trip was not primarily for business. This amendment will allow Austrade to reimburse those days primarily devoted to business promotion to the exclusion of non-promotional days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a provision for the establishment of a framework for a consultant accreditation scheme. About 50 per cent of EMDG claims are prepared by consultants. Austrade is working with consultants to lift claim preparation standards but considers that a formal legislative scheme may be necessary if consultants are not responsive to cooperative efforts. This is an important part of the government's overall approach to industry policy and to trade policy as a whole. We have here a scheme which facilitates and assists small and medium-sized firms, particularly, to expand and develop export markets overseas, not only to Asia but throughout the world to a number of the locations mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Fischer). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme has to be seen as part of an overall integrated program by government to assist business. The government does not believe that we can do it all by ourselves and it would be crazy to suggest that that was the case. We have a range of businesses and industries throughout Australia which have the capacity and the potential to expand into international markets throughout the world and to develop a much better trading base for Australia. We have a responsibility, as a government, to assist that. Programs such as the export access program, and the broad changes that have come into effect out of the white paper process, will assist many firms to address these sorts of issues, in terms of their forward planning in investment and markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill helps to finetune this legislation and this scheme to make it even more effective. As I said, it is a scheme that has been expanding regularly over the last few years. It is a scheme which is held in good standing by industry, and it is a scheme which does the job of encouraging export marketing throughout Australia to all over the world. I commend the bill to the House. I note that it has support from both sides of the chamber and I wish it a speedy passage and that the changes have a speedy effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the coalition does support the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. We believe it makes a number of worthwhile changes to the current act. The purpose of the amendment is to extend the period for consideration for approved joint venture and consortium and approved trading house applications. I will not go through it all because it has pretty well all been said before, but I will pick out a few points from the Auditor-General's report. My colleague the member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer), stated earlier this year that he was concerned that the export scheme was drifting and called for the government to respond promptly. This bill sets in place the mechanisms for that drifting to stop.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to the issue of the exporters of Australia. We all understand that the $150 million to $250 million that is involved in this scheme is but a drop in the bucket. When we think of the postwar period and the opportunities for stable trade, I suppose we must all welcome that. When we look at the opportunities in Asia, Europe, the US, South America, India, Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States&mdash;the old Russia&mdash;and Eastern Europe, I guess it is fair to say that we have only started on this great journey of trade. It is acknowledged, overwhelmingly, that our EMDGs, as a fraction of our total exports are but a fraction of the full sum. It is more a matter of our culture. The percentage of enterprises within Australia which are currently exporting is very small. As I keep saying, we have only just started this journey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate produces something like 50 per cent of South Australia's exports, so all my life I have been aware of the world trade situation. I suppose, as a farmer, one grows up understanding what exports are all about. In terms of incentive and the overall picture for exports in Australia, I could talk all day about what we could and should do. But we are here today just to talk about the EMDGs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer briefly to employment. I complimented the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) this morning when I saw him at a parliamentary committee meeting. In his book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Work for All</EMPHASIS>, is a commitment that, as a country, we have forgotten how to target. Whilst the member for Fraser and I would differ on how we find jobs for all Australians, I think he and I would be totally united in that target. I can only say that every piece of energy that I can muster will go into ensuring that this country enables every Australian to have a job. Exports are critical to that and, if anyone saw the former Senator Walsh's comments last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, he has got a few pretty good suggestions for us in that area. He suggests that we just let the mining industry get on with the job and we will do ourselves, as a country, a lot of good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have made criticisms before about EMDGs. This is only a small point, I guess, but I think it is important to register it again. We do have a restriction in terms of the definition in the act in that an Australian person or company seeking to create or expand exports of their products in overseas markets may, provided the person has incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, be entitled to a grant and the grant is calculated at 50 per cent of eligible expenditure after the first $15,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is very important. I would like to see those amounts lowered so that they may be picked up, and I think they would be picked up. I know many people who are interested in exporting, who would never, particularly in their initial sortie, spend that sort of money. It is a general criticism that I have made in the past and I will continue to make it. I am sure there will be criticisms from the administrators about the difficulty of administering so many claims and all that sort of thing but I cannot emphasise strongly enough that, if we want to be a country that offers full employment, if we want to be a country that maximises opportunity and its potential, then this is small beer to the small person in Australia, to the battlers in Australia who, particularly on their first trip, should be able to be picked up more easily than the current situation provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by simply saying that I welcome the audit office's recommendations, the improved accountability to parliament, the rationalisation of the strategic planning structure, the improved responsiveness, the improved quality of claims and control measures and optimisation of management planning and controls. Of course, Austrade accepts all these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation also had a number of changes to the export market development grant scheme and now it has extended the scheme to single service tourism operators to recognise the contribution of tourism to our exports. Of course, that is not before time. It also legislated to extend the export scheme for a further five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, there is nothing more important to this country&mdash;to its economic future&mdash;than exports. There is nothing more important to the wellbeing of our place in this region than developing stronger trading links and stronger exporting capacities. We have every reason in the world to do this. The Leader of the National Party spoke about our links with Indonesia. It cannot be overemphasised how important that is. At times, we are tardy in some of our trade dealings with people overseas. I think that is an area where we really need to lift our game. With those few words, I am quite happy to support the bill and I know that it will enhance the ability of Australians to access export markets. </PARA>

The amounts can be quite significant and there are controls on how the money is spent, how it is accounted for and so on.

I am certainly not going to talk about the number of previous claims because it seems to me that one of the problems with bureaucracy these days is that we worry about the number of claims and the amount of dollars but we do not perhaps give enough time and attention to whether the scheme is carrying out the objectives for which it was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, I had the good fortune to be overseas. I looked at a number of things that other countries do and I had the opportunity to talk to Australians in those countries who were trying to do business there. I was able to look at things from a practical, on the ground, point of view. In particular, I spent time in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia within the last two or three months looking at some of those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an Australian business decides to go overseas, there are a number of problems. People face the language problem, they have got to learn all about the legalities, and quite often they need networks and contacts. They also have to look at the different cultural approach. Those things can take time. For example, just about everybody who has done business in Indonesia&mdash;and officials at the Australian embassy&mdash;will tell you that if you have not got contacts in the local community you really are not going to get much business done in Indonesia. It does not matter whether you are selling food, vehicles, or any other sort of product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It takes time to establish those contacts and time equates quite often to cost. The cost is, obviously, not just putting out brochures. There is also the cost of the travel, maintaining offices and people, hotel bills, and all those sorts of things. We are talking about cost, time, contacts, and local knowledge that it is so important to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, too, many of our companies in this country are small, and, because we have had such a highly protected environment for so many years, an awful lot of them are not used to having to get out and compete in the cold, hard world. Many of our bigger companies do have those resources and are well experienced, but a lot of our small to medium-sized enterprises, colloquially known as SMEs, do not have that experience and they need assistance from schemes such as the EMDG scheme and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most common complaints I have heard from Australian companies is that processing tends to be slow, that there is not enough flexibility, and that we ought to be looking at new ways to help business. The coalition supports this particular bill&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but we would like to see much more being done, not only under this scheme but also under other schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others all agree in principle that Asia is important to this country's future, yet when we talk to people in Singapore and Indonesia all too often they tell us that their orientation is actually north. They are looking at going into China, South-East Asian areas and India. Although they recognise the importance of us to them, and vice versa, in many different ways, their major orientation is not down here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we are always going to have a real battle to get ourselves established in those markets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that we have to get more of our smaller and medium-sized companies exporting overseas, and it means that we have to provide them with expertise and assistance to do that. I am not so sure that we are innovative enough. We need to look at a number of new options, particularly when we come to dealing with bureaucracy. We have got to look much more at setting up one-stop shop arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Singapore, for example, where I visited the Economic Development Board, the Institute of Standards and Industrial Research and the National Science and Technology Board, the government gets heavily involved in facilitating the process. It even pays for sending people overseas for training and gets actively involved in stimulating activity to get companies not only developing products, but also getting into overseas markets. The Singaporean government is very heavily involved in setting up markets in Indonesia and India&mdash;it has big establishments in Bangalore in India&mdash;and it is doing similar things in China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having made that heavy commitment to getting their businesses off the ground overseas, and then their marketing efforts, they apply quite rigorous disciplines in return on the companies, probably much more severe and rigorous disciplines than we do. For example, whereas this scheme is effectively on a dollar for dollar basis up to certain limits, in Singapore the company has to contribute three or four dollars for every dollar of government expenditure. Companies have to pay out the money before they can claim it back&mdash;it is not a cash in hand activity. Also, in most cases the government will look to take some share of the profits, some form of royalty, or whatever, as a result of successful activity which the government may have sponsored. It seems to me that that probably helps in terms of their providing that revenue base, at a governmental level, for doing further things for other companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Indonesia, for example, where I had quite an extensive and good briefing, the embassy were very clear in their view that schemes such as the DIFF scheme were very poorly administered. I remember that two or three years ago, when I was a member of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, this parliament looked at the boatbuilding industry and particularly at the aluminium boatbuilding industry. We have a very thriving industry for catamarans, luxury launches, ferries and those sorts of things, and we export a lot of those products overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constant refrain that one hears from Australian industry is that there is a lack of adequate financing from government sources, a lack of adequate support in terms of the quality of the Austrade representation, and a lack of adequate help with promotional activity and so on. A lot of those companies are small start-up companies that are going to be very successful but, in their formative stages, they do indeed need much more help and support. It is necessary to help those export industries. The measures that have been proposed in the legislation before the Committee are sensible, and we do support them, but the government does indeed need to look at fresh initiatives and I urge it to do so. </PARA>

The Prime Minister announced that the export market development grants scheme would be extended for five years. Furthermore, in this legislation, the scheme is being expanded to extend eligibility to single service tourism operators and to include departure tax and visa fees as eligible expenditure. Total expenditure under the scheme will expand from $231 million to $290 million in 1997-98.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of technical amendments are also introduced. Broadly, these allow better management and control of approved joint ventures and consortia and approved trading houses, give a greater promotional focus to payments for overseas travel expenditure, and provide Austrade with the power to introduce and administer the scheme of accreditation for export grants consultants. An important element of the government's policy is to assist individual Australian firms to gain access to export markets and to increase their market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many enterprises that are currently exporting or intending to export will benefit by the continuation of the EMDG scheme. To qualify, exporters must have eligible export revenue of less than $25 million in the year of claim and must have incurred $30,000 in eligible expenditure. Many of our small to medium-sized enterprises qualify under these conditions. Grants of 50 per cent of eligible expenditure are available for overseas promotional activities such as market research and development, representation and advertising, for the cost of participating in overseas exhibitions, fares, departure taxes, visa fees, et cetera, and for the cost of bringing agents or buyers to Australia when promotion of export sales is the objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grant is aimed at encouraging enterprises to research and develop overseas markets for goods, specified services, industrial rights and know-how which are substantially of Australian origin. The maximum grant is $250,000 each year, and a minimum of $30,000 in eligible expenditure must be incurred first, as the threshold level, as I mentioned earlier, by the claimant company in order to be able to gain assistance under EMDG. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn briefly to the regional picture of the Hunter, where the three members now in this Committee room, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) and I, are all domiciled. With a little bit of stretching and flexibility, that almost includes you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, since you were born there: you are part of our region. More and more firms from the Hunter are seeking world markets for their expertise and products. This is really quite a dramatic change for the smaller to medium-sized enterprises in the Hunter, in that they are taking advantage of the assistance our government is offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of the EMDG scheme is an important part of that assistance. The scheme is being utilised by regional firms involved in such diverse industries as boatbuilding, packaging, light and heavy engineering, wine and software. I am not suggesting to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that wine and software go together!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more small to medium enterprises are discovering markets other than their traditional domestic markets. It is so often the problem in regions that firms develop, are comfortable within their own regional market and domestic market, and do not go beyond that region. So the move from a domestic regional market to a national market, and beyond, to an overseas market, is indeed a step that is long overdue. It is something that this legislation will help encourage. The export market development grants scheme increases access and flexibility, which is designed to assist small to medium enterprises in the Hunter region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's overseas representation has been reinforced in recent years. A major part of the work of Australia's overseas posts, particularly Austrade, is to assist Australian firms to take advantage of trade and investment opportunities. Australian firms&mdash;Hunter firms&mdash;are developing new skills, new processes and better products, and they are tapping into markets that they could only dream of in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Hunter an important partnership between government and industry has resulted in the establishment of the Industry Development Centre at Callaghan near the University of Newcastle. The Industry Development Centre provides a one-stop shop or a single contact point to assist exporters and potential exporters to get ready to take on overseas markets. It acts as an encouragement program and helps demystify the culture that one should sell only in one's own domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IDC also provides a link between industry and commerce and the University of Newcastle. It provides accommodation to the university's consulting and marketing group, TUNRA&mdash;the University of Newcastle Research Associates. It has established close relationships with the university's Centre for Industrial Controlled Science. It is promoting the culture that is Hunter: that it will win because it is the best. It has the best price, it delivers on time, it has an industrial relations attitude which enables the cost levels and time demands of customers to be met on a competitive basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This partnership adds to the government's assistance to industry and commerce in many areas. One of these is best practice. The Australian Centre for Best Practice is headquartered in the Hunter for a very good reason; Hunter firms were among the first to realise that to succeed they must get it right the first time. In other words, there had to be quality, consistency in quality, minimisation of rejects and delivery on time. Hunter firms realised that they had to get it right the first time; they had to do it right and do it once. That gives the result that the customer wants and it keeps cost levels down. Hunter firms are benchmarking with and are being benchmarked by leading international firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market development grants scheme provides a most useful tool to all businesses but especially to the small and medium-sized businesses. It enables these firms to explore for themselves the market they believe will benefit their business. The scheme provides financial incentives in the form of taxable cash grants based on eligible expenditure to promote export sales. It focuses on promotional activities&mdash;that is, it generally does not assist in the general establishment of business or product development. The grant is a cash grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG scheme directly supports many expenditure categories likely to be incurred by an exporter. It is an open access scheme encompassing all goods made in Australia plus a range of services covered in the act. It covers, as I mentioned earlier, industrial property rights and know-how. It provides special provisions to enable joint ventures, industry groups and consortia to expand their activities. It has special provisions to assist first-time claimants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for the scheme, applicants must be Australian residents and be the owners of eligible goods, services, property rights or know-how. Also, as I mentioned earlier, applicants have to have incurred $30,000 in eligible expenditure within the grant year. Similarly, in that respect, they need to have received fewer than seven previous EMDG grants&mdash;except in the case where there is a new market to be tapped or opened up. They need to have eligible export earnings of less than $25 million in the year of claim. Of course, the successful business will utilise the other excellent services provided by Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade is able to provide export counselling to assist a company to get ready to export. It is able to provide counselling on what strategies there are for entering international markets. A business can find specialist help to enable it to take that first step. So in Austrade's 70 overseas posts, experts provide on-the-spot information and assistance. Austrade provides a range of market research and analysis services to help companies assess market conditions and potential for their products. When the company's representative visits a potential market overseas, possibly because of an export market development grant, Austrade can provide help in arranging itineraries and appointment schedules. An Austrade officer can accompany the representative and can assist with advice and communications. The scheme covered by the legislation is administered by Austrade, as are the international trade enhancement schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also expands EMDG grants to provide export marketing assistance to single-service tourism operators to recognise the significant contribution of the tourism industry to export growth. Whilst tourism is our largest export earner, it has a lot of potential within the Hunter region; there is a lot to be gained there and a lot to be developed. If anything, tourism in the Hunter is in its infancy stage in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between 1978 and 1985, members of the tourism industry were eligible to receive EMDG grants. From 1985 to 1987, we changed the name of the scheme to the tourism overseas promotion scheme. In 1987, in Sir Humphrey land, assistance to the scheme was ended in that period of financial stringency. In 1990, the EMDG scheme became available for tourism operators but in a limited way. If an operator provided a single service&mdash;for example, an hotel or a car hire or an attraction like Dreamworld&mdash;that operator could not qualify. What the bill before us does is recognise the importance of all in the stream of tourism and it restores that assistance to that single service tourism operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with that whole service sector, I believe there is a lack of effort in many parts of Australian business and on behalf of the government generally in exploiting the opportunities for service. Service operates both ways: it is a service sector in delivering a product; it is a service sector in bringing in an imported product. It is a two-way process that covers a range of industries and a range of activities that really have not been developed in this nation to anything like the extent they could be. I am looking at the LEK report on services. Page 15 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's most successful service exports include tourism, which comprises about 60% of service exports ($7.8 billion in 1993) and education, which in 1993 clocked up $1.2 billion . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the 28 service industry categories canvassed have a low ratio of exports to domestic sales . . . Indeed, only 1.2 % of all Australian service companies are involved in export. This represents only 5% of total services capability.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, 95 per cent of Australia's services capability is not involved in export. As I said, it is a two-way process. We do not need to build a coalmine; we do not need to make steel; we do not need to disturb the environment; we do not need to offend our neighbours or residents or anyone else to be in the service sector. That service sector, particularly in relation to transport and what swings off that&mdash;I will come to that in a few moments&mdash;has a massive area for growth within Australia. There has to be a change in the culture in this city; there has to be a change in the culture of what I call `Sir Humphrey land' which is this place, the people who lead departments, the people who are responsible for government purchases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look across this whole services sector to the Bevis report on government purchasing. I am looking at the page of the report dealing with the embedded services and the advice to government purchasing agencies covered in the Commonwealth procurement circular 90/9 of November 1990. That procurement circular tells Commonwealth officers:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In complying with Commonwealth policy, and applying the concept of value for money, procurement officers should consider:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the cost of insurance and freight; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the opportunity for QANTAS, Australian ship owners, local insurers, freight forwarders and other local suppliers to participate in these activities . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By recognising that insurance and freight costs can be significant in their own right, procurement officers may be able to achieve major savings in the cost of overseas procurements or indirect importation of supplies.</PARA>
<PARA>But the committee found that the simple step of identifying the price of freight and insurance appears not to have been taken in the majority of cases. The frequency of importing product on a free on board basis&mdash;f.o.b., whereby the purchaser arranges the freight insurance&mdash;does not appear to have been substantially altered. The document goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 a survey of Government Business Enterprises and Statutory Marketing Authorities by the Insurance and Freight Working Party identified that, while agencies imported 21.4% of goods on an FOB basis, they exported 36.3% on an FOB basis thus giving overseas suppliers nearly 70% more access to activity. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other words, they have got a `sell f.o.b.' mentality, whereby they leave it to the buyer on the other side of the world to arrange the transport, the insurance and the freight. All of the service sector is just handed over on a platter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some reasons, in some parts of trade, that make it difficult to get on to a cost insurance freight basis, whereby the seller is responsible for arranging cost insurance freight. We get some of that benefit. But there is a vast potential there that is not even being explored, because of the culture in this place. When the government's own agencies&mdash;which combine to be one of the largest single purchasers in this nation&mdash;do not have that culture, do not follow that thought process and do not follow Commonwealth procurement guidelines, it is a pretty poor model for saying to the private sector, `We think you should be selling CIF. We think you should be buying free on board.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take, for example, importing components for reprocessing for the Holden car. We import all of the engines. We do not buy on an f.o.b. basis; we buy on a cost insurance freight basis, where all of the transport, consolidation in the states and insurance is arranged by the seller. The seller gets all of that benefit. We have to change that. If we go to the practice whereby we import products for reprocessing, consolidation or incorporation in products that are subsequently exported, we are losing all of that service sector. But we generally do not even try to get it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. You will relate to this one. In the debate about coal, the coal unions are saying, quite rightly, that there should be a greater effort on the part of Australian sellers to get a better price. They suggest we do it the Japanese way, and out-organise the Japanese. I use this because it is an easy example. But the Japanese want open market forces to operate in determining the sale price of coal. Open market forces mean you have to have open market access. It is very simple. If there are to be open market forces, there has to be open market access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look to the north of Australia, Japan is buying coal on an open market price development process. But on the west coast of Australia, the same Japanese steel mills buy our iron ore. Our marine insurers are competitive, but they cannot get into that market to insure the iron ore, because that marine insurance market is reserved for Japanese insurance companies. Yet the freight is sold similarly. Everything goes out f.o.b. If we are looking at growth in service income&mdash;growth in invisible exports; that is really what it is&mdash;whether it be on imports coming in or on exports going out, in those cases we have to change the culture of Australian companies. But, most of all, in the first place we have got to change the culture of government servants and government agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will move on and look at exports. We export Holden engines. Millions of dollars worth of Holden engines are exported, but the V6, which comes from North America and goes into the Commodore, is consolidated in North America. All of the parts of the components come together and are brought in, as I understand it, on a CIF basis, cost insurance freight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to support the legislation. I think that it will do a great deal to help firms in our own Hunter region to improve their efforts abroad. I place particular emphasis on the opportunities in the service sector, and I hope that as time passes, we will be able to persuade more and more Australian firms that, when they are selling an Australian product, they should go to the trouble of saying, `Have you thought about Australian insurance, have you thought about using Australian freight forwarders, have you thought about using Australian transport? In most of the cases, it involves shipping. There are many markets where we can be competitive. We have to be selective, but we can pick our mark, and if we can do that, then we are going to get a much better result for this country and a much better result on the current account deficit.

The export marketing development grants scheme, the EMDG scheme, which is administered under the Export Marketing Development Grants Act 1974, provides taxable grants of up to $250,000 per annum and it is based primarily on expenditure incurred by an Australian person or company seeking to expand exports of products and overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provided that people have incurred at least $30,000 of eligible expenditure in a grant year, they will be entitled to a grant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FNEG is an obvious success story that the McKinsey report highlights, and I am pleased to highlight it in the parliament today. As I said, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development was very impressed with the group. I would thank especially Mac Thomson, who is the guiding person in this group, for arranging the trip and I thank all those people who gave us hospitality on that day. The thing that impressed me is that on that trip not only were we seeing businesses which were booming but also we were seeing the work force, people involved in manufacturing in my electorate. Of course, a lot of people in my electorate are involved in tourism, but I think it is very important for the future economy of the far north, the future economy of Australia, that we maintain a diversified economy and that there are manufacturing firms still in operation in regions like Far North Queensland. It was very heartening to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Getting back more particularly to the substance of this bill before the Main Committee, it is interesting that there has been some criticism of the export market development grants scheme and I suppose criticism of the Australian government's policy towards trade. Professor Helen Hughes, who is someone on the free market end of the academic spectrum, has been critical of some of the government's policies. It is interesting to look at the performance of the export market development grants scheme and to see how successful it has been. I am not just saying this because I assert that it is a success story. The government obviously was concerned about some criticism of these sorts of schemes and conducted an evaluation by Price Waterhouse, with an independent econometric analysis by Ron Bewley, who is professor of econometrics and head of the department of economics at the University of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evaluation of the scheme said that it came out on top. Overall, the evaluation concluded that the scheme is effective in assisting Australian business. As I have already said, the success is shown in the fact that in 1993-94 there were 3,200 claims for EMDG grants, with an expected payout of $200 million. That speaks for itself. Businesses in Australia are going out there and applying for these grants. But it is interesting that the report that I referred to said that 70 per cent of these claims were from firms with less than $5 million in turnover, less than $1 million export or fewer than 26 employees. So not only are we assisting business in developing exports, we are assisting small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is unfortunate that the small business sector in Australia is one sector that does not acknowledge the contribution that this government has made, because in this and other schemes the government does assist small business. That statistical information shows that this scheme in particular not only helps the big end of town, as it were, it also helps small players. When we look at the success story that I have talked about with small business in Cairns and we look at the success story with this scheme all over Australia, it certainly does show that this government is providing the environment and the policies for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claimants for the scheme have high levels of commitment to exporting, with exporting accounting for an average 50 per cent of the employment investment. Again, that shows the success of this scheme, that it is not a question of hit and miss. It is not the case that claimants make claims, get some quick money from the government and do not have success stories. The success is shown in that figure, that 50 per cent of that employment investment is going into exporting activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very pleasing to see that, in the white paper, Working Nation, the government decided to extend the EMDG scheme for a further five years to extend the eligibility of EMDG grants to an expanded range of services, including single service tourism operators. This is obviously a very important initiative of the government and something that the tourism operators, as I said earlier, have been calling for, for some time. In the white paper, Working Nation, the government is responding to a clear demand from tourism operators and listening to the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this scheme and the other schemes that the government has introduced in relation to encouraging exports have been a success. The government is proud of its record in this regard and I am pleased to support this legislation before this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee entitled `Access to Justice'. It is an extensive report of some 500 pages. If the volume of the report were equalled by the significance of its content, it would be a weighty document indeed. However, in any area there will inevitably be some matters with which we agree and others with which we disagree and, certainly, on looking through the report, I find that that is the position that I am in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of examining and identifying the degree to which access to justice is equally available is something that I think has total bipartisan support. It is a matter of very real significance and consequence. I am and have been for a long while concerned about the extent to which the mumbo jumbo, if you like, of the law tends to confuse rather than to reveal. It is also of concern to me that, according to people's social and economic strata in society, the opportunity they have to have their particular cases heard equitably, I believe, is prejudiced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a problem with the legal aid system. This system is provided to give people access to legal advice but it does not always produce people whom I regard as having the same ability to present a case as those who can afford to provide their own counsel and their own legal advisers. This inequity in the system is unfortunate, as it is at the root of the problem of ensuring the equitable hearing of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report, there is comment about the extension of legal aid. Obviously, there has to be a way to help people to have access to the law if they are unable to provide for their own legal representation. I welcome the judgment of the High Court that puts an obligation on people receiving legal aid when it goes to that stage of justice. There are still impediments which are not addressed in this report for those who are beyond the economic means test level to receive legal aid, who are contending against litigants who have significant resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every member of parliament is aware of any number of cases where people are in a disadvantageous position against a larger corporation or organisation which has a lot of funds and those individuals find themselves disadvantaged. Some years ago, when I first became the Minister for Social Services, Hugh Roberton, who was then the member for the Riverina and was my predecessor in that portfolio, said to me, `Every time you extend the means test, all you do is extend the borders of discontent.' How right that is with legal aid, because the people who are just outside the boundaries of legal aid often are as disadvantaged as the people just below the limit and, in many instances, they are denied the opportunity to pursue their case. That particular area is not adequately picked up in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation in this report with which I am in disagreement is the question of robing. I know it is anachronistic to wear a wig and a gown and all that jazz, but one thing that does concern me is that there has to be a measure of impartiality in the law. I have been involved as a minister, unfortunately, on a range of occasions when members of the Family Court have been subjected to personal threats. One particular judge was killed. Judges who wear ordinary clothes are seen to be at one with the community. The law is not like that. The law has many inequities but we look towards people who are practising at law as having a professional capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When surgeons are in an operating theatre, they wear their robes for reasons unrelated to status. They wear them because of hygiene and because of the extent to which they have to divorce themselves from the patient on whom they are operating. To my mind, in the same way, members of the legal profession need to be in some way distinguished from the person for whom they are acting, or whom they are prosecuting. While robing does not give them any greater legal capacity, it does, to a degree, distinguish them from the person they are prosecuting or defending, and there is an advantage in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I know all the arguments, and although I am not particularly keen in getting dressed up in my own wig and gown, I still recognise the advantage, in the processing of cases, of being able to wear something that does distinguish a person as being something different and having a different status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having picked out those two areas of the report, there are a number of other recommendations with which I am in total agreement. For example, I think the idea of encouraging federal courts to develop court charters to specify performance standards is a very good idea. It is a good idea to continue the reform of procedures in both civil and criminal cases. In this respect, I would like to commend the work that has been undertaken by Murray Gleeson, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. There are far too many delays in the legal process. Much of the delay is the result of court procedures. It is not because of the law itself; it is a matter of the way in which the processes require matters to be heard, considered and dealt with. I am sure, if we could expedite the law, that justice would be done in many instances&mdash;not only in criminal cases but also in civil cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members, many of us find ourselves in an impossible position on occasions with people who are subject to some sort of insurance claim. It is ridiculous that years after an event people are still waiting for the processing of their particular claim. There does need to be a lot more work done. Murray Gleeson is in the state supreme court in New South Wales. The report we are debating today was commissioned by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) and, as a result, it applies to the Federal Court. It should apply right across the spectrum of justice. There has to be a way by which consideration of matters at a civil and criminal level can be expedited. Otherwise, a lot of people are going to be significantly disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is reference in the report to an area my wife Rosemary has been involved in. It is something that is also of interest, that is the use of television in court. There are two aspects to it. The first concerns the taking of evidence from children in child abuse cases. The Chief Magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory has done quite a lot of pioneering work in that respect, and I commend him for it. It is hard to know in what way and to what degree we can establish for children a fair and reasonable opportunity to give evidence without feeling that the strange environment to which they are subject in a courtroom in some way threatens them and means that their evidence is less than credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking evidence from a child is always difficult, and the idea of having evidence taken from a child using a television camera has a great deal to be said for it. It is a process which should be adopted on a wider basis. It has much for which to be commended, and it is a process that we should look at on a wider base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report refers to a somewhat wider subject, that is the experimental programming for televising court proceedings. I am not a great devotee of the results of television. There is obviously an advantage for all members in having their names and images out there being seen by people who are able to pass judgment on them, but, for the life of me, I do not see that debating within the chamber has benefited as a result. We are debating this in the Main Committee. There are about as many people here as there would be in the House itself, if we were down there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate should be a matter of trying to talk about a subject. On many subjects there is a great deal of unanimity across the parliament, but, where there is difference, there should be a genuine opportunity to present and to hear another point of view. When there is a television camera, everything is going out on the television screen, and, more often than not, people are concerned about who is going to be the end viewer. It is not a matter, therefore, of trying to persuade those who are in the room; it is a matter of trying to present a wider image. Television is intrusive and demands that people do things differently. All people need to do is look behind the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in question time and they will see an array of pretty faces, well dressed in appropriate colours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, Alan. That is the point. I too have behind me an array of pretty faces, appropriately dressed, but the interesting point is that with television people are not necessarily looking at the verdict. I guarantee that any of the people here who were looking at television last night cannot remember very much of what was said, but can remember what a person looked like. Think of the people who are on the news. Sure, people who look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Days of Our Lives</EMPHASIS>, or one of the soapies that get you in, get involved with the emotions of the subject, but that is different.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Television is intrusive. It demands a different nature of performance, and it does not allow debate. It allows the image to be examined, not the substance, and that concerns me. To go to that extent in court is mad. It is difficult to maintain impartiality in our court process. We have a number of procedures which are designed to ensure there is equity between the two sides of a particular case. Once we go to the stage of having television in court, what we are going to do is have everybody out there passing judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without wanting to go into the O.J. Simpson case, demonstrably there it has all happened. No matter whether O.J. Simpson is guilty or innocent, he will never be able to have a fair trial. The result of that will be that when his defence counsel gets up in the court he will be able to say to the judge, `How is it possible for my client ever to be gauged dispassionately by the members of the jury?' Looking at that case and at the television, and understanding the prejudiced way in which its reporting has been undertaken, there is no doubt that that comment is right. How on earth can a jury, after seeing the whole of the circumstances&mdash;all the trivia regarding his matrimonial ethics, matrimonial affairs, the titillation of the third party, and all the rest of it, all displayed in full glory&mdash;judge a matter like that dispassionately? Of course, it cannot. That is really the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth do people want an experimental program for televising court proceedings? The idea is bonkers, it does not have any validity, it is intrusive and it will prejudice justice. Anything that prejudices justice, to my mind, ought to be set aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few other things in the report that are quite good. The idea of presenting a report is good. Another report talked about a program for making criminal legislation clearer and more accessible. Part of the problem is not only making it accessible, but making it understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any legalese is difficult to comprehend, but equally, it needs to be remembered that the simpler we make the law, the more we are going to pass the interpretation of the law over to the courts. We have to find, if we can, a balance between them. We define law in simple every day expressions, and over the years we pick up words and interpret them differently. Unless an explanation is given, the interpretation will depend on judgment of particular words. Again, I think we can prejudice justice. Make law accessible by all means; make law understandable by all means, but please be careful in rewriting law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing in that sense that I would like to see the parliament pick up is a considered program for reviewing, revising and updating legislation. People who go into the parliament will know what we spend a lot of our time doing. If they have a look at the blue, they will see legislation listed. For example, Government Business&mdash;Orders of the Day on today's blue lists the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). We get a new bit of paper each day. Usually it will not be as thick as what I have in my hand though sometimes it is much thicker. Every time legislation is amended we get more and more pieces of paper. We get one that is not too thick, one that is quite thick and about 10 others. Then, before we know where we are, we have got a great bundle of legislation, all of which we are supposed to be able to read, digest and understand. We are supposed to know where each amendment comes and how it applies. I do not think that it works. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the government adopt a program, to be put in place by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. I think it would be better than the Attorney-General's Department. I would like to see the Office of Parliamentary Counsel have a designated group of people who are consistently charged with updating legislation. It takes time to do. I know, as minister for shipping and transport in days gone by, that the British merchant shipping act of 1894 was, unbelievably, the piece of legislation applicable to all maritime traffic in Australia, until not so many years ago. That was because trying to rewrite it in the Australian vernacular took so long; it took us about 10 years. Updating legislation is a good idea and I would like to see a few more people do something about it. Thank you for the opportunity to have a bit of a discussion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I say that, as I do on many occasions, I find the comments of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) entirely appropriate, for those of us who enjoyed the practice of the law were, of course, aware of the faults of the law. We all understand that justice is a notion which involves questions of fairness and equity, representation and the right to be heard, yet those of us who have, fortunately or unfortunately, studied jurisprudence know that the philosophical notions of justice are indeed different. In fact, it is true that those of us who have, in our other lives, practised the law&mdash;and in my case I spent 10 years as a police officer as well&mdash;know that justice is always in the eye of the beholder: no matter what a court or a jury may find in a particular matter, those who are for will find it just if they win, and those who lose will find it unjust. The whole notion of justice is indeed nebulous and very difficult to define. Hence the report which we are taking note of in this chamber today&mdash;the access to justice report&mdash;has a lot in it which I can both agree and disagree with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, from what I read of it, here in Australia, I look at the American experience with great fear that we should ever go the same way. There is the example of the O.J. Simpson trial. It will be almost impossible to find a jury which does not have a firm view on the guilt or innocence of O.J. Simpson. Even here in Australia, people have made up their minds one way or the other that O.J. Simpson is guilty or is not guilty. How in the blazes is a system of justice going to operate when juries have been given so much biased media reporting, before the jury has even been determined? I would be very fearful of any move in this country that would allow that sort of circumstance to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that whilst I, on the government side, am not generally regarded as conservative, when it comes to the practice of law and the administration of justice I am indeed conservative. I am very wary of change for change's sake and very wary of change because the media, the electronic media, or the public generally, want it. I have seen a number of examples in my life where justice, in a philosophical sense, was not applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my early experiences as a lawyer was to defend a person charged with murder. To this day, I do not know whether that person committed the murder or not. It was a rather famous case&mdash;R. v. Ratten. Mrs Ratten was shot on 7 May at 1 p.m. in 1970. Even today, many years later, I can still recall the exact time and date on which she was shot. Her husband, Leith Ratten, was charged with that murder. There was no doubt that he killed his wife. The question was whether it was an accident or whether it was premeditated&mdash;hence, murder. That case ultimately went to the Privy Council in England and was one of the very last matters that left Australia's jurisprudential system to be determined by the Privy Council, the English system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because justice is, indeed, a view. People can never say, in difficult cases, that they believe absolutely that a person is guilty or not guilty. Hence our system, rightly or wrongly, says that the Crown needs to carry the burden of proof and that that proof must be beyond all reasonable doubt; and, prior to that, the person must be accepted as innocent of that crime. I will oppose any change to this vehemently and strongly because, even under those pretty rigid rules, there is still potential for error. That is because jurors are human beings. They view people through their own prejudice; they view evidence through their own prejudice, as we all do as human beings. When there are 12 people they can, through their own prejudice, find guilt. However, on a better forensic examination, that guilt sometimes is not there. I speak as someone who has quite often questioned notions of justice. I speak as someone who has charged people with crimes, followed them through the system and seen them go to gaol. At the same time, as a lawyer, I have defended people who are charged and have, over that period, developed quite different notions of justice and the way our systems work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without question, I most certainly oppose too much media access to our system. I have concerns about the victims of crime organisations springing up in this country. I would agree entirely that the victim of crime is often the last person in our processes. But people tend to forget that our system of justice is such that the state is the complainant; it is the state, the corporate structure, which is complaining about the conduct of others in criminal matters, not the victim. The victim's redress is in the civil jurisdiction&mdash;to seek damages and to seek other forms of remedy against the person who committed the crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the state is seen in two areas&mdash;not only to be enforcing behaviour through the criminal law but also to be, if you like, punishing in terms of monetary penalty to the victim&mdash;the two areas get rather confused and difficult. I know that, particularly in Melbourne and Victoria, the victims of crime organisations are now becoming critical organisations in the sense that they are insisting that governments move in ways in the justice system which I find quite fearful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I have seen some fundamental changes since I first started practising law in 1970. One of my great worries is the fact that, in Australian law schools today, there are as many undergraduates as there are practising lawyers in Australia. That is a most fearful thought because, since my days of entering practice, the number of practising lawyers has quadrupled. I can only speak of Melbourne and Victoria. Certainly, there is now a lawyer on every street corner in Melbourne and in Victoria. You cannot turn your back without finding a lawyer or a legal practice. Economics teaches us that, the more people there are seeking a source of income from a given field of income, the more prices rise or standards collapse as people are forced into doing things to gain an income source out of a fixed or limited field of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A constituent who called me last week is the father of a young lady who had gone through a family law breakdown problem, a property settlement in the Family Court. His daughter had just received the bill from the legal firm. It was a complex matter in that the husband's family had a number of corporate structures where assets were rather difficult to trace&mdash;maybe deliberately so, maybe not. In any event, it was obviously a fairly complex property settlement. Nevertheless, the Family Court apparently ordered a property settlement of $145,000 to the custodial spouse, the wife, who had three children as well, and sent her a bill for $65,000. I do not find that justice, quite frankly. I have difficulties when, in that type of breakdown, the $145,000 is diminished by a legal bill of $65,000 so that the custodial spouse and the young children involved in that breakdown will undoubtedly be thrown back onto the public purse and seek further assistance because of the high cost of the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is that very famous case in New South Wales involving a lawyer, Mrs Foreman. I think we have all read about Mrs Foreman's tribulations before the Law Institute of New South Wales on a disciplinary procedure where, on a property settlement of some $540,000&mdash;again in the Family Court&mdash;her legal fees were in excess of the property settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice which is not affordable is justice which is denied. As a lawyer, I have to sit back and really query where the legal profession is going when with those kinds of legal charges people will be denied rights. My fear even now is that many people are not getting access to our judicial systems because they cannot afford lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kennett government in Victoria, for example, has slashed $10 million from legal aid funding. Taking $10 million dollars from legal aid funding is quite severe. In my years of practice I found it impossible to get legal aid funding for people who were facing criminal charges in magistrates courts. It became increasingly difficult to get legal aid funding for matters in the Family Court. Now in Victoria it is just about the case that people get legal aid funding only for murders or the most severe crimes where prison is the appropriate penalty, and more and more ordinary people are being denied appropriate funding to gain access to justice. As I said, access to justice means ability to pay, ability to fund and ability to get access to the courtrooms. Increasingly in Australia the reality is that people are being denied that right because of financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some proposals in this report which may assist in reducing the cost of legal representation. There is no doubt the legal profession has been fairly restrictive in the way it has conducted itself over a number of years. For example, in Victoria I was admitted to practise as a barrister and a solicitor. That is, I had the right as a lawyer to appear before the Supreme Court and Magistrate's Court as a barrister. I also had the right to practise as a solicitor without appearing in courts; in fact, in my own career I appeared as both. When I practised in country areas I donned the garb and appeared in county courts and magisterial courts. When I went back to the city I practised generally only in magistrates courts and as a solicitor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was moved to practise in the state of New South Wales, much to my horror, I found that I was not entitled even to be called a barrister and a solicitor. It is a divided profession; that is, the bar is a completely separate legal profession from solicitors. In fact, my title in New South Wales as an admitted practitioner is as an `attorney proctor and solicitor' of the state of New South Wales. As a Victorian admitted practitioner, when I appeared in the Supreme Court in Sydney to be admitted to practice I was not even referred to as a barrister and a solicitor because the reality that as a lawyer I could be a barrister and a solicitor was not recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So New South Wales still has a long way to go in recognising that today all lawyers are graduates from universities. There is no distinction between the legal training of those who call themselves barristers and those who call themselves lawyers, and it is an absolute nonsense to distinguish between people who are qualified in both areas of practice. Those at the bar, of course, say that they are the advocates, they are skilled at verbal appearances. I do not know about that. I am not a practising barrister&mdash;</PARA>

Why should any person in a particular legal matter be forced to pay for the services of a QC and at the same time pay half the fee of the QC to a junior barrister, who inevitably does very little, in my experience, in such a trial?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt whatsoever that a large number of costs associated with access to justice are due to the antiquated notions of the legal practice in Australia. They are, of course, those which we inherited from the practice in Great Britain. It comes back, I guess, to the view that we in Australia should start to cast off some of those ancient British notions and develop our own strictly Australian concepts of justice, of court systems, of our adversarial system&mdash;which our legal system largely is&mdash;and move more towards mediation, towards lowering the cost of dispute resolution. After all, courts are about conflict. Be it in the civil jurisdiction or the criminal jurisdiction, it is a conflict between two people. If you are charged with a crime and the state says, `You did this', you as the defendant say, `No, I did not do this', so there is conflict, and we are resolving conflict through the judicial process. In the civil jurisdiction, too, that is really what it is all about. So we can reduce costs very largely by getting some of the archaic and anachronistic procedures we adopted from Britain and look for a mediation process and means of reducing cost and making access more readily available. </PARA>

Before I do so, I just want to say that I trust that this matter will continue to be on the agenda, as there are, I think, a number of members from both sides who still wish to make a contribution in this debate and who for one reason or another are not available. I am particularly aware that the member for Tangney (Mr Williams) definitely wants to make a contribution but unfortunately is not available at the moment, so I am pleased to hear that the government is happy to have this debate continued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help observing, having listened to the previous speaker, the member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), admitting that he is a conservative on this issue, that there is some self-interest in his conservatism, yet he belongs to a party which claims to be the great, egalitarian Labor Party. I ought to say that I am not a lawyer&mdash;I want that on the record firmly&mdash;nor am I an expert in these matters. I have hardly read this report, so I have only been sitting in and listening, but I thought I might make a small contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the point, which I have also heard put elsewhere, that there is concern about the number of people being trained to become lawyers. I guess the concern about that is to do with the resources being wasted in training lawyers who may not get work. I think part of the answer to that, and the member for McEwen surely would be aware of it, is that a lot of people being trained for the law are not going to practise law. </PARA>

The honourable member says in Melbourne that there is one on every corner. I assume he is saying that that is not a good thing.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why have they gone up? That does not comply with the rules of economics in any respect. The legal profession has argued amongst itself about whether or not it should be able to advertise. It seemed to me to some extent self-evident that allowing members of the profession to advertise would also tend to promote competition which we would be committed to on this side of the House. This would therefore force down the price of legal services. To take a medical analogy, if we wanted an orthopaedic surgeon to do a job, that would require a high degree of skill, and there are clearly not a lot of people with those skills because they take many years to acquire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it that the same thing would apply if we had a difficult legal case and we needed to be represented by a highly competent lawyer who is skilled in advocacy. The division in the profession makes a lot of sense. There are people who are barristers, who have that particular skill in advocacy. For that reason, I am not sure that the move that seems to be in vogue to disband that differentiation is necessarily going to be productive. I am not necessarily even arguing that barristers' fees are too high. If we want someone with that skill and knowledge, and not many people have the skill or knowledge, obviously the price is affected. In a sense, it is a fairly good market; it is almost a perfect market in terms of availability of knowledge. However, I agree that, on the supply side, it is the same as getting an orthopaedic surgeon. There is obviously a limited number of orthopaedic surgeons; there is a big demand for their services; and the price goes up. It is difficult to increase the supply side. It is difficult to increase the supply side of highly skilled barristers or advocates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to make that point. As I say, I am arguing as a layman. The average person in the street would surely take the same view, that we really do not have too many lawyers&mdash;and I would not necessarily argue this in the same way with my legal friends. The more lawyers there are, the more likely it is that the price of legal services will come down. If, as the honourable member tells me, the price of legal services has gone up at the same time as there are more lawyers, this would run contrary to any law of economics I had ever learned at university. There would be something going on that perhaps the Trade Practices Commission ought to look into because it should not be happening. Allowing lawyers to advertise would also put a brake on prices or charges&mdash;however one wants to put it. They are some of issues but, as I say, I am not an expert in these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make a brief comment about legal aid. Once again, having glanced through the report, and I am not speaking as a lawyer but as a member of parliament, it seems to me that there are huge problems with access to legal aid. I do not know that the report solves the problem but I notice it has established one of the three crucial objectives in achieving access to justice: regardless of means, all Australians should have access to legal services. They clearly do not; they just do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one restriction on that access is the cost of the service. Not one week goes by in my office&mdash;and I think probably almost every honourable member of parliament would concur; the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) I am sure would concur&mdash;without someone coming to me, needing access to justice. People do not have the funds. Very often they need access to justice because their business has gone broke and they are absolutely destitute. They have not got a cent. The same thing would apply in a family law matter. Often an enormous amount of pressure is applied by the husband who, for one reason or another, has got the family assets; the wife is destitute and needs a lawyer to act for her, but she cannot get legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it from reading this report there is a general acknowledgment that there are limits to the amount of money that is available. There are limits to the amount of money that is available to do anything. The problem of governments, I guess, is that it is limited. It is the basic economic problem, if we want to get back to economics, of limited means and unlimited demands or wants. Somehow the system is not serving its purpose. There is a fundamental breakdown here. I see it as a member of parliament. Not a week goes by without my having people in my office who have no access to justice. They have not got any money so they cannot go and hire a lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They need a lawyer. I am no help to them in a legal sense; they need a lawyer. I send them down to the local legal aid office or I contact the local legal aid office. I really know the answer before I phone because those offices have so restricted the sorts of things that they are prepared to fund that I know before asking that they are not going to fund this particular matter. Although there is discussion in this report about the funding, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent study by the Law Council indicated that the level of legal aid funding has not diminished in real terms . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is true, but it also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Law Council's study also contended that, upon a closer examination of the legal aid system, there has been an effective restriction in funding and tightening of eligibility criteria as a result of a substantial increase in the demands on legal aid services over the same period. It estimated that, to restore funding to a level that would provide legal aid to those who were eligible in the 1987-88 financial year, there would need to be an increase in funding of not less than $50 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>That was in 1987-88. I would imagine it is much worse. The other problem is that this is a partnership, as the report points out, between the Commonwealth and the states. I do not know whether in Queensland the state is actually putting its share up. Somewhere, there is a big gap in the amount of money that is available. So my plea in this particular area, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to do it in the context of this report, is that there should be more funding for legal aid. I do not want the argument from the government `where is the money going to come from?'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a tension. I am conceding that is a tension. There is a certain amount of money to go around. What I am saying to the government is: somewhere there is a big gap in funding. There needs to be access to justice. We all agree with that. I think we all agree it is not available because, as I say, not a week goes by but we find someone who cannot get funding. There are areas where it has been restricted. Legal aid offices do not fund any family law matters any more. It seems to me there is no more crucial area of the law. I do not know whether the member knows or whether it is argued somewhere why that is not the case, but family law is a crucial area for legal aid funding. It is no use having either the husband or the wife coming to us destitute. We have to sit there and listen to them and see them break down in front of us and say, `You need a lawyer.' They cannot get legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other concern in Queensland&mdash;I do not know whether this is happening everywhere else&mdash;is that legal aid offices are not funding what they regard as commercial cases. If people have been wronged by a bank or a supplier and they have gone broke, have not got a cent and are living on the dole or whatever social security is available to them, clearly they cannot afford a lawyer and they need legal aid. Yet in Queensland they are not funding broadly commercial cases. This is right. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) is also a Queenslander; he knows there is no funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contribution I am making to the discussion really gives me the opportunity to highlight the concerns that I, as a member of parliament, have about the legal aid service. It is all right for the government to tell us that there is not enough money to go around for everything but I am making this point to the government today: it is your problem; you are the government. If we were in government, hopefully we would do something to solve the problem. But it is your problem in government to provide more money for legal aid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had not been my intention to enter this debate but it is a bit difficult to listen to some of the comments that have just been made and not provide some response. In terms of the global question of funding that the member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) quite properly raised, there is an area of concern and there is an area of unmet need. There is no doubt about that. Any parliamentarians who have had contact with legal aid offices, community based legal aid services or constituents who go to those services will know only too well that there are quite genuine and proper cases that a reasonable person would want to see funded which are unable to be funded under the current arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week I was looking at the funding figures for community legal aid services in Queensland and, from memory, there has been an increase of nearly 100 per cent in funding over the last five years. That indicates a very substantial growth in the funding that has gone to community based legal services. Notwithstanding that huge Commonwealth increase in that area&mdash;sadly, through that five-year period, it has not always been matched by a state government commitment&mdash;we still have an unmet need. This is an important question of social justice and, if the law is to work fairly and properly, as it is intended to and as the community expects it to, it is necessary to have access for all on a fair and equitable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem I have with this debate, when members of the opposition stand to point out the problem that I have also addressed, is that at other times in this parliament when we have had debates about budget outlays and fiscal management, the very same people argue that the government is spending too much money&mdash;not too much money by a few million dollars, but too much money by a few thousand million dollars. So at the very same time that those opposite are arguing that we should allocate more money for legal aid, they are also saying we should be cutting $5,000 million from our existing expenditure level. We do not need to do Economics 101 or Law 101 to understand that we cannot cut $5,000 million out of government outlays and then with any credibility stand up and say that we should be spending a few hundred million more on&mdash;</PARA>

When we wipe out all of the things that the $5,000 million eliminates, and we reorganise the priorities, we are still left with a massive problem.

Every time we have a budget debate they say, `Spend less money.' Tho opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot reconcile the two by talking about money that might have gone to ANL or anywhere else because that is a drop in the bucket against the $5,000 million the opposition says we should stop spending.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Following the public review of the composition, structure and administrative arrangements of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chaired by Dr Max Richards, the Government introduced an integrated reform package for AGSO in the 1993-94 Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the reform package the Government decided to set a minimum external funding target of 30 per cent of AGSO's 1994-95 budget appropriation to be achieved in 1995-96, with an interim target of 25 per cent to be achieved in 1994-95. External funding in this context includes funds raised from cost recovery activities (such as charging for products and services) and a range of other activities which AGSO undertakes on behalf of other government and private enterprise clients over and above its core activity of undertaking geoscientific mapping to encourage economically and environmentally sustainable development of Australia's mineral, energy, soil and water resources.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Following the  review of the composition, structure and administrative arrangements of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO) chaired by Dr Max Richards, the Government introduced an integrated reform package for AGSO in the 1993/94 Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the reform package the Government decided to seek an increased contribution to the costs of the Continental Margins Program (CMP) from holders of offshore exploration permits and retention leases through a levy on these permits and leases. The aim of the levy was to raise approximately half the cost of the CMP, but the legislation was rejected by the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government has set AGSO a minimum external earnings target of 30% of its 1994 95 budget appropriation to be achieved in 1995-96, with an interim target of 25% to be achieved in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) See response to question 1 above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Report of the Richards Review recommended that "The `public good' nature of AGSO's programs and outputs be recognised ie precompetitive, of wide benefit and long term in nature" (Recommendation 4.13). The Review is a public document and copies are available from my office, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and AGSO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5)&mdash;(6) The Government believes that AGSO functions of an essentially `public interest' nature should be funded by government appropriation; functions which primarily benefit industry should be funded by industry and that function's benefiting both industry and the wider community should be jointly funded The Government also considers that activities not directly related to AGSO's core business should be funded by its clients and that a reasonable charge should be made for products produced from its core business. This will encourage the work undertaken by AGSO to be prioritised in the appropriate policy framework and focused as closely as possible on clients' needs</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Program provides a wide variety of information of different types which vary from project to project and from time to time. Its primary focus is identified in its objectives. The objectives of the CMP are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"To provide geoscientific information and advice, consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development, to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">make Australia a more attractive exploration investment option</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">assist with resource and environmental advice in relation to marine parks and protected areas."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) I have not sought information on whether other national governments impose levies for the provision of baseline scientific data. It is not unusual for users of such data to be charged for their use of data or to contribute to the cost of collection, especially where the data has a clear commercial value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9-11) The CMP produces data of proprietary benefit to the exploration industry and has the potential to provide a wide range of benefits to individual exploration companies, the exploration industry as a whole, and to the Government and the wider community. These benefits are likely to be realised over several different time periods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) The relevance of the CMP to industry was examined as part of the AGSO Advisory Council Evaluation Program for 1992/93. The evaluation, which included oral and written advice from key industry clients, found that there is an identified need by industry for CMP data, and significant support by industry for the CMP. The Evaluation Report is available from AGSO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) No. Recommendation 4.26 of the Richards Review, however, is "the Rig Seismic replacement to be a National Research Facility as recommended by ASTEC (the Australian Science and Technology Council) in its 1992 Report `Major National Research facilities&mdash;A National Program"'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) Records of sales of CMP products prior to 1988 were not kept. Total sales of data from the CMP since 1988 has been $5,871,579 to 31 December 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(16) The full cost of the CMP in 1992/93 was $20,965,509. This cost can be broken down to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data processing is carried out at various stages of data acquisition and enhancement and details of all these costs are not available. The cost of the Seismic Data Processing centre (which is also involved in processing seismic data acquired by AGSO on land) was $1,549,000 in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(17) and (18) Yes. AGSO does not duplicate the efforts of industry in collecting data but collects data sets that complement industry data sets or are for non industry clients. For example, data is sometimes collected by AGSO in frontier areas where there is little industry interest currently, but where additional data may raise perceptions of prospectivity and industry interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(19) and (20) AGSO collects 2D seismic data offshore for use in regional analyses; industry customarily collects 3D data, which provides more detail and is used for the evaluation of particular prospects. Industry representatives have raised concerns in the past about the nature and quality of AGSO's 2D data. Industry appears, however, to be becoming increasingly aware of the value of 2D data in planning exploration strategy and recent CMP 2D data is widely regarded as the best quality regional seismic data available on the North West Shelf of Australia. The seismic data processing stream pioneered by AGSO has been adopted by several sectors of the industry because of the superior results obtained in this regional application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(21) I have not consulted with the States and Territories on the possible introduction of a levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(22) It is not possible to provide a list of all the users of the services of the Rig Seismic as the products of its services are widely disseminated and a wide range of organisations and individuals have either undertaken research making use of the vessel or made use of data generated by AGSO using the vessel and its research facilities. A sample of users of Rig Seismic data were consulted during the CMP Evaluation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(23) Rig Seismic is a multi-disciplinary geoscientific research vessel and an essential source of data for all the client groups of the CMP. Further details on the role of the vessel is given in the CMP Evaluation Report mentioned above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(24) See (7) above. The CMP forms an integral part of the marine geoscience research effort in Australia and the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(25) No. The CSIRO research vessel Franklin is used primarily for physical oceanography.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes, it is a fact that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> has made her last voyage, being decommissioned from service on 8th August 1994. It is planned for the ship to undergo a series of scientific trials and experiments over a 10 week period, as part of a Ship Survivability Enhancement Program (SSEP) which is designed to collect and evaluate a considerable range of data in terms of ship combat survivability, personnel safety and significantly raise the creditability of Australia's defence research and development efforts in the international scientific community. In particular, the data gathered during the experiments will be applicable to the Anzac frigates and will be used to enhance their design for survivability at sea. The experiments will involve fire, smoke and detonation of explosives and, upon conclusion of the experiments, the Navy will dispose of the hulk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The disposal options being considered are selling the hulk for scrap value, sinking the hulk in deep water and sinking the hulk in shallow water as a dive-wreck/artificial reef off Western Australia. The option for selling the hulk for scrap value is unlikely as the damage anticipated from the experimental program will preclude a long open-ocean tow to ship breakers in China, the Indian subcontinent or South-East Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) All options are still under consideration and assessment in consultation with the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Authority, the Western Australian Premier's Department, the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection, the Western Australian Maritime Museum, the Attorney-General's Department, community and commercial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories received formal advice from the Department of Defence concerning the SSEP and consultation has ensued between both departments and the Western Australian Department of Environmental Protection which has advised that the proposed survivability tests are considered to be environmentally acceptable. The Risk Management Plan and Experimental Program are currently being provided to the Minister for Finance and Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories. Formal application for a permit under the Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Act 1981 is in process of preparation and negotiations with federal and state authorities seeking approval to sink the former HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> as a dive-wreck/artificial reef, should it be endorsed, are continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) Additional cleaning processes will be required if the shallow water sinking option is preferred. These costs are yet to be ascertained. It is considered that the SSEP will provide scientific data of inestimable value and, combined with the potential value for tourism in the case of the shallow water option, should it be endorsed, will more than compensate for the loss of the small amount of revenue to be derived from selling the ship for scrap value.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August 1994 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> Page 218) Mr Campbell asked the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Would the minister agree that there is a problem with people in country areas purchasing cars from city dealers when these cars do not meet the specifications described, usually verbally? The state small claims tribunals seem incapable of giving assistance in these areas. Does the federal legislation offer any help to these people? If not, would the minister consider taking up the matter with the states and discussing the means of strengthening the small claims tribunal provisions so protection can be afforded?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If cars do not meet the specifications of purchasers, there can be a number of remedies available to the purchasers, under both the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the fair trading legislation of the various States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Act, in particular, provides a comprehensive regime of protection to consumers. It confers rights upon consumers who suffer loss as a result of misleading or deceptive conduct by businesses, or as a result of breaches of other more specific prohibitions of unfair trading practices. These provisions are enforced by the Trade Practices Commission, or consumers themselves can take action to seek redress for contraventions. Where goods are faulty or mis-described, the Act also provides consumers with contractually enforceable rights against the seller of the goods, as well as statutory rights which can be pursued against the manufacturer or importer of the goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumers in remote areas, of course, can be faced with special difficulties in seeking to enforce their legal rights. The Government is aware of the problems facing the community in obtaining adequate access to justice and will be seeking to address many of the important issues in its Justice Statement later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most effective ways of safeguarding consumer rights, however, is to ensure that consumers themselves are fully informed of their rights. The Government has recently undertaken several initiatives in this area of relevance to the matters raised by the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consumer education is an important means of ensuring that all consumers, especially those in country areas, have access to information to help them make better purchasing decisions. The Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and other government consumer protection authorities manage a comprehensive consumer education program which aims to promote a greater awareness of consumers' rights and responsibilities. For example, in the last year the Bureau has collaborated with the former South Australian Department of Public and Consumer Affairs to manage a consumer education program entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Don't Get Ripped Off: You Have Consumer Rights</EMPHASIS>. This program targeted indigenous people in central Australia and aimed to make them more aware of their consumer rights and responsibilities in relation to motor vehicle purchases, life insurance and second hand goods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Financial Counselling Grants Program administered by the Bureau supports financial counselling agencies in many rural areas around Australia including Alice Springs (Northern Territory), Derby (Western Australia), Rockhampton (Central Queensland). These agencies provide services to disadvantaged consumers on financial matters including major consumer purchases like motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State limits on the jurisdiction of State and Territory small claims tribunals would usually be exceeded by the value of a new car. However, in the cases of a minor failure to comply with specifications, the cost of adjustment might often be well within the limits of the relevant tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jurisdictional limits of the State and Territory small claims tribunals are matters for the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member believes that there is a problem in a particular State or Territory, it might be appropriate for him to approach the relevant State or Territory Minister.</PARA>
