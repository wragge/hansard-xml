<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 1992-93 annual report</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FJ4">Mr SIMMONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is the first of what the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration intends to be a series of reviews of matters arising from the annual reports of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The committee chose this course of action in the belief that there needs to be a continued focus on a number of issues highlighted in the committee's previous banking reports, particularly in relation to the interests of consumers of banking services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sees a need for continuing parliamentary oversight of banking and financial services as a means of addressing broader policy issues, including the role and function of the Reserve Bank. An annual review of the RBA's annual report provides a valuable accountability mechanism where concerns arising from changes in banking and financial services can be discussed in a public forum outside the supervisory relationship between the RBA and the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee examined a number of issues as part of the review. The most significant issue was bank interest rate margins. This issue was dealt with in previous banking reports by the committee. In response to a recommendation in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Pocket Full of Change</EMPHASIS>, the Reserve Bank reported in its annual report on bank interest rate margins in order to provide more reliable information instead of relying on anecdotal evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was particularly concerned to determine where bank interest rate margins in Australia stood in comparison to those overseas. It was stressed by both the Reserve Bank and the Australian Bankers Association that making meaningful comparisons was very difficult and that comparisons currently available suffered from a number of shortcomings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significance of margins is not simply whether they are high by world standards. They also give an indication of the extent of competition in the industry. The RBA has now compiled data on a selection of banks that are comparable to Australian banks. This was reported in the RBA's 1993-94 annual report and will be examined by the committee in the review of that annual report. The committee examined the available data on international comparisons. This material indicated that Australia was in the middle of the pack as far as margins were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also looked at profitability as a possible measure to assess whether the criticism levelled at the banks that they are recovering their past losses from customers is sustainable. The ABA expressed the view that levels of profitability are not out of line with those in other industries. It was also suggested that the reduction cited by the ABA may simply reflect the impact of the recession, bad debts and non-performing loans. The committee will look at this further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another area that will be examined by the committee in relation to the margins is the level of income derived from fees and charges. The report contains a table provided by the ABA which sets out non-interest income as a percentage of average total assets for OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did note that Australia was at the higher end of the range. This appears to be at odds with an initial reading of the RBA study which suggested that Australian banks derive a smaller than average share of their income from fees and charges than do banks in other countries. The committee will also pursue this matter.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is not convinced that current margins reflect a truly competitive banking environment. Unlike the Reserve Bank, the committee is not presently convinced that margins in Australia are in fact mid-field. Evidence suggests that there is scope for a reduction in margins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I will touch on a couple of the other issues examined in this review. The committee was pleased to see that the Council of Financial Supervisors is now established and operating effectively. The council has an important role, given the increasing significance that financial conglomerates are assuming in Australia's financial system. The committee will continue to monitor developments in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also continues to have a strong interest in consumer protection. The committee agrees with the RBA's view that the relationship between banks and their customers still leaves a lot to be desired. The code of banking practice is yet to be fully implemented and the committee is still concerned that the code does not apply to small business and the rural sector. This contrasts with codes operating in New Zealand, Ireland and the UK. Similarly, the operation of the banking industry ombudsman scheme is restricted by having an unrealistic financial limit and once again excludes small business and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is convinced that the scheme provides a valuable alternative to litigation. I am sure that all honourable members are aware of the difficulties that many experience in resolving disputes with banks when confronted with expensive litigation. Changes to eligibility would assist in resolving the problems of many distressed customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RBA has also been assessing the strong growth in the use of derivatives. The committee agrees with the RBA's view that derivatives will continue to be a focus of debate. We are particularly concerned about the risks involved in the use of derivatives by businesses, both large and small. We would not like to see customers with a lack of knowledge and understanding of the associated risks getting into difficulties which are similar to those which occurred with another risky product of the 1980s, the foreign currency loans. The legacy of that debacle, unfortunately, is still with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank the secretariat in general but particularly acknowledge our adviser, George Stoyanoff, from the Australian National Audit Office. I thank the committee for its work in producing this report. I acknowledge the cooperation of the RBA and the ABA and commend the report to the House. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the committee's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone&mdash;A report on the home and community care program</EMPHASIS>, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FI4">Mr ALLAN MORRIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I present this report by the Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the home and community care program, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone</EMPHASIS>. The terms of reference for this inquiry were referred to the committee on 23 June by the then Minister for Health and Community Services, the Hon. Brian Howe. The inquiry was advertised in July 1993 and almost 400 submissions were received. We conducted 20 days of public hearings, generating over 3,000 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> evidence. Inspections were held in Sydney, Nyampa Aboriginal community in New South Wales and at Broken Hill, where a public meeting was also held. A discussion/options paper was published in February this year and 3,000 copies were circulated. Well attended public forums were held in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These statistics indicate that the committee sought to consult widely during this inquiry. Perhaps more importantly, they indicate that the community very much wanted to be involved. This involvement need not end with the tabling of the report. I am making myself available to address community meetings dealing with the report over the next few months. I believe it is very important that those in the community who want to respond to this report understand the thinking behind our proposals. A presentation is being held at Parliament House on Wednesday to which all members have been invited. I urge those who cannot come to send a staff member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home and community care is a complex topic, with substantial variations within and between states. While the committee has worked hard and long on this report, it would be foolish to believe that we have produced a perfect set of recommendations. The report strives to blend the competing interests and political considerations with practicality. We have recognised the need for change and I believe our proposals are desirable and achievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are over 80 recommendations covering the full scope of the HACC program, they can be summarised to the following: the program objectives and target group should focus on supporting in the community people of all ages with a functional disability and their carers; the establishment of a single access point to the HACC program, which we have titled the regional community assessment agency; responsibility for post-acute and palliative care being transferred from human and community services to health; the administrative restructuring of the HACC program to a regional basis, including budget holding; the introduction of mandatory quality standards and an independent complaints mechanism; the reconfiguring of consultative advisory bodies and functions on a regional, state and national basis; an increase in the cultural and language sensitivity of the program; improved linkages between HACC and other adjacent and intersecting programs and the recognition of the role of carers and volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three key structural changes proposed: namely, the shift of post-acute and palliative care, a single access point and the regionalisation of the program. In regard to  the assessment process, we would propose the establishment of the regional community assessment agency, which would consist of a multidisciplinary team that would be responsible for the total region, with the state health regions as a starting point. I envisage that they would be distributed geographically but electronically interconnected so they could share information. These agencies would assume all of the functions of existing aged care assessment teams and would become the sole access point to HACC services. Duplication would be avoided by the agency being able to contract out its functions to other agencies, for example, to a community options project in a small town or to an existing disability assessment group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More specialised staff such as interpreters could be contracted as needed to ensure cultural and language sensitivity. Agencies would use appropriately trained staff to conduct assessments. Hence a geriatrician would not assess for a home-delivered meal but whoever did would also assess the total environment, including the needs of the carer. The data collected from the very first contact would be available for future assessments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most controversial role proposed for the assessment agency is of determining the needs of those being discharged from hospital who require home support. This goes to the very heart of the case mix early discharge issue. The committee formed the view that, while ever it is the sole responsibility of the hospitals to determine the home support needs of a patient, there will be a lack of community confidence in the move to earlier discharging of post-acute or terminally ill patients. The use of an experienced, professional and independent assessment agency specialised in the home support needs of people with functional disabilities will ensure that hospitals are not discharging patients early simply to save money. It will also assist hospitals to develop adequate discharge planning regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agencies could also help in the development and application of suitable DRGs or equivalent unit cost measures for the reimbursement of hospitals. Assessments would be reviewable and regional forums would be able to discuss the methods and criteria used by the assessment agency. This would ensure that suitable levels of openness and accountability are established. The agency, by not being a provider of services, would have no conflict of interest involved in carrying out its tasks. It is important, however, that the assessment conducted by the agency can be supplemented with a care plan that may be developed by a provider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of such a proposal are substantial. To name just a few: regions would develop common assessment parameters; there would be a clear knowledge of professionally assessed need and shortfall; the barrier between the hospital and communities would be diminished; there would be a single HACC referral point in each region; regions would be able to professionally match and prioritise their resources with their needs; there would be no conflict of interest between assessment and provision of services; client ownership would be diminished; and assessment stress would be completely eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to post-acute and palliative care. While there was a great deal of anecdotal evidence suggesting that this no-growth area had actually grown, the lack of data collection meant the committee could not form an accurate conclusion. Similarly, it is difficult to accurately predict the impact and implications of early discharge from hospitals and the future role of casemix. There is, however, an overwhelming view in the HACC community that post-acute cases are increasingly consuming HACC resources and that the growing use of casemix will worsen the situation. There is also a widespread suspicion that early discharging from hospital is more in the interests of hospital budgets than the patients' wellbeing. The fact that some state governments asked for this no-growth restriction to be lifted was a confirmation of these fears for many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recognises the need for continuity of care for existing HACC clients who require hospitalisation. This led to the recommendation that hospitals be required to maintain the same providers after discharge. We were also concerned to establish that the at-home care for a new or existing HACC client be accepted as part of the acute episode with no less status or shift in medical responsibility than the in-hospital care. We were told of case after case where patients, when being discharged, were given the very clear message that they were no longer the responsibility of the hospital or health sector. The committee's recommendation on assessment and post-acute and palliative care substantially addresses these issues as well as providing a more logical and cohesive structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third aspect of the report is regionalisation, and the thrust of it is both sensible and timely. During the inquiry the massive variations between the size and scope of HACC providers was obvious. They range from small community options programs to massive state-wide organisations. Equally graphic was the chaotic nature of the health boundaries used by state and Commonwealth departments. The geographical variations between health, aged services and HACC mean that not only is data collection difficult but, where it is collected, it is often meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments have tended to regionalise their health services, with a high level of local autonomy. This demonstrates that such a method is viable. Given the effectiveness of the health boundaries and the nature of the health assets and transport systems, it is logical to use regional health boundaries as a starting point. This would mean that the Commonwealth boundaries for aged services covering nursing homes, hostels and community aged care programs as well as HACC would align with regional health areas. Minor adjustments may be needed to allow compatibility with census collection districts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having aligned the boundaries, established the regional community assessment agency, transferred post-acute and palliative care to Health, it is now essential to establish a regional budget holder, together with fully functional regional forums and an independent regional review and complaints mechanism. The regional budget holder could be a state department or group, a joint Commonwealth-state group or a jointly appointed community body. Whichever form is taken, it is critical that it be autonomous and not subject to political interference at either the state or federal level. This would mean that none of the normal HACC services would be funded on a state-wide basis. It would also allow regions to develop a wider basis for flexibility and delivery of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I want to thank the members of the committee who took part in the inquiry, particularly many of the new parliamentarians. They have built up a great understanding of community care. The secretary of the committee, Mr Bjarne Nordin, warrants praise for his excellent management of both the politicians and our processes. Ms Lynette Sebo performed the sterling work which has become her trademark. Special appreciation is due to Ms Joy McLaughlin from the Department of Human Services and Health. Joy quickly adapted to the committee, and her knowledge and professionalism added greatly to the quality of the report. I thank her on behalf of the committee. We wish her well in her future career. Thanks are also due to those officials, organisations and individuals who made submissions and gave evidence. This particularly extends to representatives of ACOSS, ACOTA, FECCA and ACROD, who made up our public forum panels, and our facilitator, Mr David Efraemson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is certain that, with the ageing of our population and the increased move to independence, Australia needs an extensive and effective home and community care system. While there is overwhelming support for HACC, there is also overwhelming agreement that the program has substantial shortcomings. This report comprehensively responds to these shortcomings with fundamental and far-reaching proposals. They represent an opportunity for reform that must not be squandered. I urge all who read the report to involve themselves in this opportunity by responding in writing to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and the appropriate state minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the opposition contributors to the report of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone&mdash;A report on the home and community care program</EMPHASIS>, I wish to speak in favour of it. I apologise first for the deputy chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie), who would have spoken at this point and has taken a very real and personal interest in the matters about which we have been deliberating, as he is unable to be with us at precisely this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HACC program has been important and is becoming increasingly important as we become a society with people who are in particular need of care to enable them to live in their own homes, a society where the number of people who are living to older ages is continuing to increase and a society where the cost of providing ongoing care in institutional environments is expensive and prohibitive. What came through to me in the course of the inquiry we undertook was the extent to which there have been quite significant variations in the various states of Australia in the way in which they have developed programs to meet their community needs. Very often that is a good thing because innovation is important, but the extent to which we have moved in quite different directions in a number of the states and the inadequacy of the information that enables us to effectively evaluate the success or otherwise of the various programs that have been undertaken does give one cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the recommendations that are contained in this report foreshadow moves in new directions but also require very careful evaluation and monitoring of those initiatives. I think this is an appropriate way to proceed because it will develop the strengths of the HACC program. It is not taking away from the state governments or their various agencies their ultimate responsibilities, but it is putting in place systems to enable effective monitoring of the way in which these needs are being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw attention to some matters raised in the report which are of concern to me. I am one who has been concerned about the ability of our communities to meet the needs of those people who suffer a range of functional disabilities. One of my concerns is that the HACC program, which ought to be able to assist not only the elderly but also those with functional disabilities, has had problems in the past in addressing those needs. There has been the view that disability ought to be dealt with separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are recommendations in the report that we should increase the focus on addressing the needs of individuals of all ages with functional disabilities and the needs of their carers in order to support them and maintain their independence and quality of life within the community. I think it is important that the HACC objectives be amended to ensure that the needs of that target group are met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also mention the issue relating to the collection of data and the analysis of the reasons for underutilising services, particularly by NESB people&mdash;non-English speaking background people. This has been a difficulty that has afflicted this service which needs to be addressed overall. The problems of the inadequacy of data came through not only in relation to the way in which particular groups in the community were able to access services but also more broadly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to draw attention to the extent to which the committee looked at the issues relating to the way in which people who are discharged from hospitals might be better served, the need for more effective assistance in discharge planning and the development, with the new arrangements for casemix, of post-acute care support provisions. There are some very positive recommendations contained in the report which deal with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to commend those who are carefully reading this report to look at the recommendations of the committee which are designed to maintain the diversity of the current service provider types and provide for an overall approach on a regional basis to the provision of funds and support for programs which are properly assessed against how they address the needs that exist within the community. In paragraph 9.43 of the report there are some very imaginative proposals for pilot programs to further develop HACC which I believe can take us in more useful directions in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased to endorse the report and I commend those of my colleagues who spent so much time in developing this very useful document. I commend the staff of the committee for their role and the expert advice they made available to assist committee members in the development of this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having been a member of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs that carried out this inquiry, I would like to make a contribution to this debate. Most people in the electorates we represent will know there are an awful lot of government programs&mdash;state, federal and local&mdash;that support people at different levels in the community. Those programs can be very confusing at times, as I am sure any member here will agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home and community care program was the bringing together of a number of programs that were funded by government. Probably the longest serving of these was Meals on Wheels. Everybody knows about Meals on Wheels, an organisation which takes food to people who cannot get out of their homes. There were a number of other programs as well, including the modification of homes for people with disabilities, home nursing and so on. The government is to be commended that in the 1980s it brought all these disparate programs together to form what is now HACC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in its lifetime HACC has also caused a lot of confusion amongst people in the electorate: those who receive the services and those who may be eligible for them, as well as their carers, GPs and so on. One of the aspects of this program was to make it more available and to make knowledge of the program more widely spread across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We found, as we travelled around the country, that the way the program worked varied considerably from one place to another. In some states an established nursing service received most of the HACC funding and provided most of the services; in other states we found a lot of smaller groups that perhaps served only one small area or region or even a small town. So it has been very difficult to get all the information together and hear from all of those people on the effect of the service, how it was delivered to the clients and how the clients felt about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program, as we all know, was designed to provide the services needed to keep people in their own homes so that they were not automatically institutionalised, as quite often they were in the past. We all know the value of nursing homes and hostels, but there is that gap in between. Most people in the frail aged and disabled groups prefer to stay in their own homes. We found a great need still existed there, although in some areas, of course, the service was adequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area worth highlighting is that of carers. I will always remember, at the hearing at Springwood in my electorate, a woman, the mother of a disabled adult person, who came up to me during the break and said, `I've just discovered I'm a carer.' This was a great revelation to her. She took it as natural that, as the mother of a young person who had problems, she was looking after this person. But she discovered that she was actually worth something&mdash;she was not just a mum doing her duty&mdash;that she was a carer and worthy of consideration from the HACC program and various government services, and that her needs were as great as her daughter's needs. We all know people who care for those with dementia and disability and who make a lot of sacrifice on behalf of their friend or relative. But sometimes the carer's needs are forgotten. So looking after carers&mdash;caring for the carers, if you like&mdash;is an important part of the HACC program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Respite is also an important part of the HACC program: respite for carers so that somebody else takes over their responsibility; and also respite for the people who are being cared for. What I think most people want out of this program&mdash;and I hope that this report will go a long way towards providing it&mdash;is continuity and consistency. Without the proper knowledge of what is available under the program, how it works and what is accessible, we cannot have that continuity and consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report goes a long way towards clarifying a lot of the issues that needed clarification and towards overcoming some of the duplication. When state and federal governments work together, there will always be those problems. I hope that the report will result in a better service being provided to those clients of HACC and their carers. So it gives me very great pleasure to commend the recommendations of the report to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). </PARA>

The fact that Australia is an ageing nation will cause difficulties in the future, as fewer and fewer people will be able to fund an ageing population.

When particular subjects were being discussed, I would always ask what they would mean for rural and remote communities. It is very pleasing to see that a special section of the report is devoted to the needs of rural and remote communities. The differences in needs are highlighted in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those people in my electorate of Maranoa who presented submissions for consideration by the committee. A very wide cross-section of submissions were received by the committee. The committee did travel to remote and rural areas, and it is very important that, as a parliament, we focus on the needs of not only those who live in our closely settled capital cities or regions of Australia but also those who live in rural, remote and isolated areas, including Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, department figures show that 54 per cent of the service outlets in Australia are in rural and remote Australia. In other words, a majority of these service outlets are in rural and remote Australia. So it is very important that our report covers the issue of the needs of those communities. </PARA>

The Department of Human Services and Health thought it probably needed only half of one administrative person to operate the two offices which cover the whole of the Pilbara region in Western Australia.

Obviously, that was not a sustainable situation, as the members of the committee realised.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have great pleasure in speaking to and supporting this report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Home but not alone&mdash;A report on the home and community care program</EMPHASIS>. The home and community care inquiry was the first inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs which I have been involved in from beginning to end. The committee travelled to every state of Australia and to many regional centres, including Campbelltown in my electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HACC program is in the fortunate position of being not only a good social program providing better outcomes for consumers by enabling them to live at home but also a program which has economic benefits due to the relative cost of caring for people at home compared with caring for people in nursing homes and hostels. When the economic rationalists and the bean counters look around for savings in our social programs, as they are wont to do, they will see that HACC is actually saving the government money and is working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I found most interesting about the evidence we received at the various public hearings was the discussion on the question of the administration of the program, that is, the respective roles of the Commonwealth, the states and local government. There has been much debate in recent years about the roles of different spheres of government in many of our programs in the health and community services area. I will not dwell too much on this, but it was significant, in my view, that nobody who gave evidence, other than the state governments themselves, supported a reduction in the Commonwealth's role. Certainly nobody supported the program being handed over to state governments. Could we blame them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was much discussion on the question of the role of local government. I believe that, while individual councils can and certainly do choose whether or not to be involved in direct service provision or auspicing of HACC projects, the potential strength of local governments is in their ability to be involved in planning and coordination of services at a regional level&mdash;that is, councils working together on a regional basis and being involved in planning and consultation around the provision of HACC services. This is what the peak councils representing local government were seeking during the inquiry and this is very much reflected in the recommendations contained in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention one particular issue which came to light in New South Wales, particularly at Campbelltown and around my electorate&mdash;that is, the question of access to respite care for people with disabilities. This issue came up because there was a perception in the community that people with disabilities were being discriminated against, as opposed to frail aged people, in accessing respite care services. I am pleased to say that, because this issue was raised in the context of the inquiry, we were able to sort it out to a large extent. It certainly appears that there have been some misunderstandings and some misinterpretation of the guidelines by various government agencies, but I think we have managed to sort out that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank several people for their assistance to me in my work on this inquiry. I thank Mandy Moore, the HACC development officer from the New South Wales Local Government Association, and her predecessor in that role, Louise McDermott, both of whom provided valuable assistance and guidance to me throughout the inquiry. I would also like to thank the Macarthur HACC development officer, Louise Polikarpus, particularly for her valuable assistance in convening a public meeting at Picton in my electorate. I believe it was important to get as much consultation as possible on the options paper, so we convened a meeting to discuss that in April. That was very valuable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all of the HACC providers and consumers in my electorate for their input into this process.

<PARA>To a very large extent this motion speaks for itself. It reflects widespread and growing concern on the part of many people in the community about the circumstances in which our coal industry operates and in which our coal is sold overseas. At one time that concern was largely confined to employees, mining unions, and people like myself and my colleagues who will be speaking to this motion and who represent coalmining constituencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concern has become much more widespread. Organisations, impartial, unbiased objective people within the community, and academics are all now increasingly indicating their concern about what is happening in this industry. I appeal to those members of the opposition who are going to speak to this motion not to build straw men and not to misrepresent what this motion seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say, first of all, what it does not seek to do. It does not seek to establish a national coal marketing authority in the sense of a wheat marketing board or a wool marketing board. It in no way suggests that there should be a coal acquisition scheme or that the federal government should unilaterally take over the sale of Australian coal and negotiate itself all of those terms and conditions. I emphasise the first part of the motion, which says that a national coal authority should be established to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . oversee and coordinate negotiations between Australian coal exporters and overseas buyers . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the motion seeks to do. Of course, there are other elements of the motion also concerned with the general management of Australia's coal resources and with some of the questions, issues and problems which need to be addressed there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian coal industry is Australia's major export industry. It earns for us every year about $7,500 million; it employs almost 30,000 people around Australia; and to a very large extent it supports coalmining communities which tend to be very widely dispersed and which are almost exclusively dependent upon that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is also the world's major coal exporter. We supply over 30 per cent of the world's seaborne trade. The fact that Australia's total coal reserves are a relatively small proportion of the world's coal reserves and the fact that we have only about 0.3 per cent of the world's people means that on a per capita basis Australia's coal reserves are very significant indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 60 per cent of our coal exports go to Japan, which, of course, establishes Japan as our major coal buyer. We are very dependent upon Japan for the purchase of steaming coal, which it uses to generate power, and for the purchase of Australian coal in the steel industry and for the viability of the Australian coal industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise that I am a strong supporter of the developing relations between Australia and Japan. I do not want this to be seen as a hatchet job by me or by anyone else on Japan&mdash;I am not a person who would perform such a task. I am a strong supporter of those developing relations. There is a natural partnership between Australia and Japan which is underscored by the special features of our national economies and by our proximity. But that relationship must be forged on the basis of an equal partnership, on the basis of mutual respect and a transparent honesty, and on an insistence that there will be an equitable sharing of the enormous benefits which can accrue, and which will accrue, as the trading relation between Australia and Japan develops and as our economies more closely integrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The claim is often made that the coal industry and coal sales overseas on the part of Australia have to face market realities. I agree with that. Market realities necessarily include demand and supply conditions. However, those market realities include not only conditions of supply and demand but also other elements. For example, they include the clear identified cartel buying arrangements of the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robert Humphris, the chair of the Australian Coal Association, just a few nights ago on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>, Kerry O'Brien's program, referred to these arrangements. He said that it is not a cartel; it is a collegiate system or arrangement. With respect to Robert Humphris, for whom I have a lot of personal regard, what the hell does that mean? It makes it sound almost like a fraternity. It is a cartel. It operates as a cartel. Let me say that it operates very successfully as a cartel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those market realities also include the uncoordinated, self-seeking approach of Australian coal exporters. It should no longer be tolerated. They compete against each other when they go to Japan. They go cap in hand to the Japanese coal buyers. They sacrifice price for volume. The overall effect of that is something I hope I will have a chance to develop during the 10 minutes available to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other element of those market realities is the dominant position of the Japanese buyers. The world goes to them. First of all, they pick off one country after another. They pick the weak link. This year it happened to be Canada. So they picked off Canada, established price levels with Canada and then ensured that those price levels flowed on to other countries as well. As they deal with each country, they pick off the weakest seller. This year in Australia it happened to be BHP. They picked off BHP and those prices then flowed through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the coking coal buyers established the price benchmarks, those prices flowed through to steaming coal as well. I emphasise the point that while there may have been circumstance in the Japanese steel industry which justified a reduction in coking coal prices this year&mdash;but I do not declare that&mdash;there was no excuse for the reduction in steaming coal prices, but the prices flowed through. That is related to the general claim made that the prices reflect market realities, which are supply and demand. They do nothing of the kind. For example, Don Barnett, the Managing Director of the Macquarie University's Mineral and Energy Economics Centre, anticipated those changes in the steaming coal prices before they occurred. He said that the steaming coal prices will be set by Japanese culture, not market fundamentals, which insists that they not be seen to be coming to some sort of buying arrangement which is significantly dissimilar from that which was achieved by the coking coal buyers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those prices are not exclusively set by the market forces of supply and demand. If they were, how could anyone explain the fact that in 1991, for example, the prices in US dollars for US coal was $62 a tonne; for Canadian coal, $71 a tonne; and, for Australian coal, $55 a tonne? I know some people can say that there are differences in quality and distance, but they are not sufficient to explain those differentials. They are not sufficient at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the major productivity gains in the Australian coal industry since 1983 have been transferred by way of a subsidy to Japan through those coal prices. The price cuts,  together with the benefits of the appreciating yen since 1983, particularly because Australian coal prices are written in terms of US dollars, have meant an effective transfer or subsidy of about $30,000 million from Australia to Japan since 1983. That is about 20 per cent of our total net overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting, and I have never suggested, that that could have been avoided had we exercised closer surveillance and had we insisted Australian coal exporters go over there and coordinate their efforts, instead of going over to Japan as they do&mdash;and they cannot deny it&mdash;and compete against one another to our disadvantage. I never suggested that that could have been gained with more effective coordination and surveillance, but there is no question that a significant proportion of it could have. This year those reductions in prices cost us about $500 million. That continues year after year. That is the equivalent of a wage rise of about $500 a week for every employee in the coal mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no industry in Australia where our track record of management and the pursuit of national objectives has been more abysmal than it has in the coal industry. The destruction of forests, degradation of soil, salting of rivers and so on are all visible. They encourage public reaction. But the abandonment, the sterilisation and the destruction of our coal reserves are hidden from view. Our treatment of our national coal reserves is a national crime. It is profligate, exploitative and destructive, and it is criminal in relation to our national objectives. To allow the present position to prevail will represent an inexcusable abrogation of our national responsibilities. Something should be done by this national government&mdash;and the sooner the better. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a perfectly good seat at the moment. Let us examine just how this system&mdash;which the member for Charlton is so upset about&mdash;works. Under the system that we have, coal exports have tripled since 1980. The Australian coal industry is now a $7 billion a year export industry. Australia is the world's largest coal exporter. Our Japanese market share is growing at 60 per cent a year, despite attempts by the Japanese to diversify into other suppliers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only this; the Australian coalminer is a prince amongst blue-collar workers. The Australian coalminer is, quite properly, one of the highest paid workers in industry. If that is a disaster, we could do with a few more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing system, when the Canadians offered the Japanese a $5 a tonne price cut, we were able to resist that downward pressure and receive a much better comparative deal. The system works well because we are reasonable people to deal with. If the Japanese cartel is as evil as members opposite say, how is it that these evil, wicked, terrible, conspiratorial Japanese are actually giving us a higher price than just about any other price that we get from any other nation in the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, if the member's national coal authority were established to coordinate selling, the first thing that it would try to do would be to artificially inflate the price. What would that mean? First, it would mean that the Japanese would look elsewhere for their coal, and our share of the Japanese market would fall. Second, it would mean that there would be much less incentive for greater efficiency amongst Australian coal producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Third, it would produce a boom-bust cycle in the industry. Prices would be kept artificially high&mdash;higher than the market could bear&mdash;until, sooner or later, the price could not bear this fixing and it would collapse, with resultant disaster to companies, communities, workers and, in the end, even to unions. Eventually this national coal authority would feel the need to coordinate production across the nation. It would start saying which mines were to expand and which mines were to contract. It would not be following market signals; it would be following political signals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear lesson from attempts to manipulate industries through politics is that they always fail. Just imagine what would happen if there was this national coal authority: the mines owned by the coal workers union would expand indefinitely and the mines owned by everyone else would be forgotten. There would be less investment in industry because the miners would feel that they were not working for themselves but for the government. We would have another example of the wool marketing corporation. We would have the same situation in the coal industry that we had in wool, namely, an artificial expansion propped up by unreal prices; a non-viable industry followed by a huge and tremendous crash which would cause nothing but pain for everyone concerned, and producers saddled with vast debts and the taxpayer ultimately, potentially, liable for vast debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what needs to happen is quite simple: we need to help this industry; we need to get this industry to work better but for the benefit of individual workers, shareholders and the whole Australian community, not just the mineworkers union. We need a stable, efficient and prosperous coal industry, and the last way to achieve that is by setting up yet another industry authority. Let us end the rorts, rackets and rip-offs which still occur. The coal industry is not as bad as it was. But it is only a few years ago when the American producer of a coal excavator was told that the model to be shipped to Australia had to have a bunk in the cabin for the off-duty operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some mines not so long ago some workers did not so much bundy on and bundy off as sign the visitor's book. The simple truth is that the industry is improving. The surest way to stop those improvements is to have a national coal authority of the type that honourable members opposite are suggesting. In the coal industry we need to move away from this class conflict, the them and us attitude, this Japanese conspiracy, this cloth cap, fourth rate Leninism which honourable members opposite represent. We need to get away from `Dear comrade' letters flooding the industry and spreading ancient attitudes of class hatred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to preserve the best attitudes of mining communities: the tradition, loyalty and mateship, but not this class conflict of the them and us attitude. The real problems of the coal industry are the difficulties that are stirred up by the union. The union is the cause of the problem, not the solution. The coal industry lost three days per worker in strike action in 1993 against an average of just one hour per worker in other industries. And it is the fault of your union!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this proposal seeks to ruin the whole industry to help a few struggling mines. If an individual mine does need help there are better ways to do it than to set up a national coal authority. If an individual mine needs help, let us give it direct help&mdash;let us do something for an individual mine on a strictly limited, short-term basis so that that mine can put its house in order and improve its work practices or, if needs be, so that it can wind down gently. But the fact is we do not want to ruin the industry just to help a few struggling mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government's real agenda is not helping individuals; it is helping unions. Since 1983 this government has given $66 million in direct grants to trade unions. In 1993, as well as $14 million in direct grants, it gave $10 million to the Trade Union Training Authority, and $5 million to help run union elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This government has handed out $10,000 to the Metal Workers Union for writers in residence and $12,000 to the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council for a writer in community. The real agenda of the honourable member for Charlton is not to help the industry or to set up this authority; he is just hoping that when the electors boot him out at the next election he will get a job as bore-in-residence for the United Mineworkers Union. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would be aware of a campaign by the United Mineworkers Union concerning coal prices. I totally support the campaign. It is not a new issue. In my maiden speech in the parliament in 1983, I drew attention to the situation in the coalmining industry. Indeed, since that time, things have not improved; in many respects, they have become worse. Thousands of jobs have been lost to the industry and the real price per tonne decreased because of dramatic commercial corruption in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are a number of factors distorting the coal market, which, in the end, favours the buyers. There are collusive buying practices by Japanese cartels. These cartels set a ceiling price which flows through to other markets. If this practice were conducted in this country, it would breach the Trade Practices Act. If we do not accept this kind of practice in Australia, why should we accept it in the international market?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I listened to the honourable member opposite, who made much about the dread of these cartels. But his party supports the cartel of the sellers of beef, wheat and wool. We all know of the mess that the wool industry got into, but suddenly, when it comes to coal, it seems to be very logical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese have the Australian buyers go to Tokyo. They stay in luxury hotels in Tokyo, all waiting for the telephone call. When the telephone call comes, they trot. The Japanese, dealing in a collective, always trade one off against the other. As the honourable member said, there is always a chink in that chain. After the first one breaks and gives way on price, there is a mad scramble for volume. It has happened year in and year out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have been in this place 11 years, but I have had an association with the coalmining industry for many more years than that. The story has always been the same. The buyers come back. When the local paper covers it, they say, `We did our very best. Prices went down slightly, but we have increased the volume.' More coal is now being exported at a lower price than ever before. Every Australian is paying the cost. There is an argument that coal is far too important to the economy of Australia to be left to these sellers, who have proven time and again that they are not up to the task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) recognises that I do have some very important coalmines in my electorate. I am conscious of their importance and I hope that the government is as well. When the government puts up excise on diesel fuel on coal lines such as the Moura to Gladstone line and collects from that simple train line $1.7 million per year in excise, then I have every reason to be concerned for the community of Moura and the miners who live there, whose future is put in jeopardy by that sort of charging.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), I am not going down a negative valley, but I want to canvass some of these issues. When a motion such as this is before the House, it is a good time to take a searching look at where the industry might be going and how its development might impact on the national interest. Of course, each group in the community has a different perception of what constitutes national interest, and the scene becomes even more blurred when the discrete interests of one constituent group come into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no less so in the case of coal and, in particular, export coal, which is the focus of the suggested national coal authority. The fact that Australia is the largest exporter of coal&mdash;132 million tonnes of our total production of 180 million tonnes, or 70 per cent, goes overseas&mdash;makes the prospect of such an agency a matter of concern to all in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take issue with the honourable member for Charlton when he said that the Australian industry is profligate. Energy sources are going to change over the next 20, 30 or 40 years. By the time coal supplies are exhausted, coal will probably not be used any more. If we have 8.7 per cent of the world's coal reserves and at this stage represent only 5.2 per cent of its production, we could hardly be called profligate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not resile from the fact that I have a great deal of sympathy for the motivation behind the union's submission to the ACIC study&mdash;it argues a case not unlike those argued by my party in the past for the protection of Australian export industries&mdash;but I think honourable members on both sides of the House recognise that those days are fast fading and we have to take a more hard-nosed approach to what we do with our national resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I have some misgivings as to the validity of the basic argument that something akin to one-desk selling will necessarily work in the coal industry. First of all, the argument flies in the face of the stated policies of both the government and the opposition for a more competitive and market oriented industry regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central to the UMW's case is the suggestion that the current Japanese methods are both collusive and designed to force down prices. The fact that we supply that nation's needs to the extent of 70 per cent of its steaming coal and 50 per cent of its coking coal gives us strength as well as vulnerability. But if we were to sell through one authority or sales were authorised by one authority, one has to ask whether Japan would be as ready to be so reliant on us as its major supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UMW, in its submission, in conjunction with a matrix showing the contract structure of Nippon Steel in 1984&mdash;and I suggest that honourable members opposite look at that structure&mdash;asks: is this a set of transactions, or a coordinated purchasing strategy? I ask perhaps a third question: is it not a mechanism to ensure the availability and continuity of supply in every conceivable set of circumstances? In other words, is this not a Japanese industry covering its back?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept, however, that it demonstrates a high degree of market sophistication in purchasing, and in that respect I wonder whether Australia might not be better served by a mechanism for greater market intelligence than by an authority with stringent regulatory powers. I am encouraged by discussions I have had with John Maitland, and I believe that his trend is turning away from a regulatory body much closer to this idea of market intelligence. There is not sufficient time available for me to go into the matter of the second proposition other than to say that, if there were a regulatory body, would it not eventually come to the point of saying: who could open and not open mines; who would have to close mines; and who would have to limit production? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the recent parliamentary recess, I had the fortune to visit these three countries and that point was made consistently. When the China Steel steel mill in Taiwan was asked about where it would get the coal for its new blast furnace, it had no doubt that the coal would come from Australia. It did not want to go to South Africa or elsewhere; it wanted Australian coal because it knew it could guarantee the quality and the supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own part of the world, the Hunter Valley, like the honourable member for Charlton, we know the importance of the coal industry to the whole of the communities that thrive there. It was very interesting to hear that the federal government takes $1.4 million in excise. The state government in New South Wales takes $140 million a year in hauling coal down the Hunter Valley and, because that coal line is making a profit, it is up for sale. Where was the New South Wales government in the negotiations in the recent drop in coal price? Did it consider being asked to drop its freight rates? No. That is one of the reasons that we must consider a national tribunal where all the players in the mining game&mdash;everyone who works in the mining industry and who makes a profit out of the mining industry&mdash;must be included in the negotiations and must be prepared to shoulder some of the responsibility to make sure that this coal industry, this leader, continues to thrive and support as many communities as it does. </PARA>
<PARA>The criticism comes back that it is the unions requesting this. I ask all people in the House to seriously consider the contribution that mineworkers have made. We have heard from the honourable member for Throsby about coalminers who have lost their lives in his area. We are all only too aware of the recent tragedy in Moura, and I appreciate that that again was in the electorate of the honourable gentleman opposite. They are the sorts of things that coalminers and coalmining families live with all the time. Not representing any coalminers, you say that is par for the course; that coalminers know that when they take on the job. But it is still a very big factor in their lives that occasionally where there is a coalmine a tragedy will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask that we seriously look at what coalminers have contributed. I have already pointed out the increase in productivity per coalminer over the past 10 years. But those opposite have come in here and in a very unobjective way have said that coalminers are some of the highest paid people in the world, or some of the highest paid people in Australia. But the contribution that they make to the export earnings of this country is one of the highest per capita. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is more than coincidence that the electorate of the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) produces exactly the same amount of coal as my electorate. This motion is before us because some weeks ago the ACTU and the mining union announced the release of an industry blueprint claiming that Australia's sovereignty had been jeopardised by the collusive pricing practices of the Japanese coal buyers, demanding greater control over local coalmining arrangements. The plan amounted to no more than a renewed effort to win popular support for union based regulation of the coal industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union movement has failed to adjust to the tough reality of international competition, and only domestic reforms would secure the future of the coal export sector. The union proposals are a thinly disguised effort to virtually nationalise the local coal export industry. In fact, I believe that, if the coal authority goes ahead, it will wreck the $7.5 billion coal export industry, scare off investment and undermine Australia's reputation as a reliable supplier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wholehearted endorsement of the plan by ACTU president, Martin Ferguson, has cast a shadow over the micro-economic reform agenda. All commodity exporters face multiple competitors and tough dealing on the part of buyers. Only those coal producers who can secure local cost advantages and high levels of productivity will win out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the ACTU's support for a government sanctioned Australian coal cartel spells the end of the road for efforts to boost the efficiency of the coalmining sector. The impact of the peak union's endorsement of the coal plan could not be underestimated. If acted on, the ACTU's stance will see buyers rush to alternative suppliers and will ruin opportunities for local mines to take a foothold in Asia's emerging markets, particularly in steaming coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion proves that the federal government has recently shown signs of wilting in the face of pressure by unions to wind back reforms in the coal sector. Plans to merge the coal industry's antiquated industrial arrangements within the mainstream jurisdiction of the Australian industrial relations system now lacks a timetable of any definition whatsoever. Any delay on the reform agenda on these fronts will be to the long-term detriment of the coal industry as well as its work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government wants to do something for the coal industry, I suggest that it turns to its industrial relations reforms. If we are not achieving the right price and if we do not have the bargaining power that we should have as a major coal exporter and as the most efficient coal exporter and coal producer in the world, we must have reliable supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been flying from Queensland to Canberra for many years now. It always amazes me when I look out over Newcastle and see the ships standing offshore due to an industrial dispute. We can see the same thing in Gladstone and in a lot of our major ports.

I noticed earlier during the debate on committee reports that there was a shortage of opposition speakers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike the honourable member for Warringah, I have coalmines in my electorate and a number of workers who are members of the coalmining union.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coal is the highest export earning industry in Australia. It is a particularly important industry on the south coast of New South Wales and, indeed, within my electorate. It employs a lot of people. We are losing at least $300 million a year in export earnings as a result of a reduction in prices. Whether that is caused by the Japanese or other foreign countries getting together and playing off our individual coalmining producers one against the other to reduce prices, that has to be a matter of concern. It is also a concern in the area of employment. The union estimates that we are losing one in 20 jobs every year because of price reductions in coalmining. I am concerned about that and ordinary Australians should be concerned about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to work together in the national interest and, as the union says in its literature, we have to play as a team; we have to become team players. The opposition should know&mdash;especially now&mdash;about becoming team players; we have heard a fair bit about that in the last few days. That is what the CFMEU is talking about. Australian industry and Australia generally should be a team player in the coal export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a mixed economy. Unlike some parts of the world, we do not have a totally command economy, nor do we have a totally capitalist economy. We have competition where appropriate. A report which has just come out calls for more competition amongst public sector utilities. We also have government intervention where that is appropriate. When the national interest is at stake, when Australia's jobs and Australia's export earnings are at stake, what is wrong with having government intervention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As outlined in the honourable member's motion, what is wrong with having a coal authority to oversee and coordinate negotiations between exporters and overseas buyers? What is wrong with developing a national role in the management and development of Australia's coal reserves, as called for in the motion? What is wrong with having a body to advise the government on measures which are appropriate at the national level to ensure that employees receive a more equitable return for their cooperation in industry restructuring?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a more efficient industry, but let us not sell out the national interests by allowing a totally deregulated situation to threaten our export dollars and our jobs. I have already said that the coalmining industry is losing at least $300 million a year in export earnings, depending on which estimate one goes along with. That is probably one of the minimum estimates that I have heard. As well as that, one in 20 jobs a year are disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the sake of my constituents and the coal industry in my electorate&mdash;indeed, in New South Wales and Queensland, which is where most of the coal is&mdash;it is important to have this national coal authority.

In response to Kerry O'Brien, Mr Humphris said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we've had collective negotiations from Australia . . . All the soft coking coal producers out of Newcastle in the early `80s got together. They were known collectively as the `gang of seven' and then I think they became the `gang of six' and the `gang of five', and they negotiated collectively. But I think any objective analysis of their negotiations over a period of years would show it was pretty well neutral.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement is from an acknowledged respected leader within the coal industry. This whole business about margins and appropriate prices bedevils us all in all ranges of commercial activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to note an issue dear to my heart when the report of the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration was introduced by its chairman. Committee members noted the margins that the banks were charging. They said that they were not satisfied with the evidence from the banks and, therefore, it was a matter of national concern. I agree that, if there is not a sufficient margin in the coal industry, it has to be a matter of national concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the other part of the equation known as market realities. The argument that persuades me most is the competition with other energy sources. It is interesting to note that coal prices have fallen less than have oil prices over the last 15 years. If we look at OPEC, one of the world's most famous cartels, we see that a whole range of mechanisms has occurred over a 15- or 20-year period and has forced down the price of oil. We want to be very careful that we are not thinking about Fortress Australia in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should think about alternative energy sources. Australia supplies a lot of coal to Japan&mdash;60 per cent of its steaming coal imports. However, over time Japan could reduce its dependence on Australia's coal for power generation. I understand that coal goes into other industry purposes. Let us look at Japan's sources for electricity. Oil represents 32 per cent&mdash;cheaper than coal over a 15-year period&mdash;and nuclear energy, 24 per cent. I was interested to hear the MPI last week regarding the three mines policy. I do not suppose we will have a three coalmines policy, a three uranium mines policy, a three copper mines policy or a three farms policy. I am sure that the honourable member for Charlton would not advocate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we ought to look at market realities. Japan uses gas for 19 per cent of its electricity. Everyone acknowledges that in 50 years time gas will be huge. Our country has to get its act together. An issue that needs addressing by both the states and the Commonwealth is the way in which we get gas around this country and the way in which we export our gas. Japan uses coal for 14 per cent of its electricity and hydro for 11 per cent. That is Japan's electricity make-up. Japan also has some other options. It has the option to move away from Australian coal. It could use coal from Indonesia, South Africa or USA and use more oil, gas and nuclear energy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look quickly at the Japanese as not the enemy&mdash;the honourable member for Charlton tried to stress that he did not want to look at them as that&mdash;but certainly as tough business negotiators. Currently the Japanese have a 16 per cent interest in the 1992 production of Australian mines. They have an interest or ownership role in Australia's coalmines. The Japanese are involved right from the base as producers and importers. The point I want to make is that the Japanese have an interest from a profit perspective. I do not think anyone would suggest that coal producers are wandering around the world deliberately trying to sell coal as cheaply as they can. I think they will always try to maximise coal prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we need to demonstrate to our overseas customers that our coal industry is ready to become competitive, and we need to introduce greater efficiencies.

<PARA>I am an Australian nationalist and regard the future wellbeing of the federal structure of our nation as something that all of us should preserve and nurture against those who wish to subvert it through domination of its political, economic and cultural activities on the eastern seaboard as well as those who connive at the encouragement of secessionist sentiments in some of the outlying states. Its national broadcasting service has a critical role to play in strengthening the federation. Unfortunately, in recent times the ABC has become somewhat of a handmaiden to the interests of those who seek to centralise power and influence close to their geographic power base, which is of course in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation towards centralisation of its programming not only is antipathetic to the interests of a nation that balances national interest with the interests of the states but also flies in the face of modern cultural and social history. The move by the ABC to alter news and current affairs production is remarkable for its lack of vision and understanding of what Australian consumers really want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">David Hill has been criticised in many quarters for his ratings driven approach to programming, yet he and his management team are now in the process of making changes which will take the ABC news and current affairs programs further away from the people they are supposed to inform. At his National Press Club speech in July 1992, Mr Hill told his audience that the ABC `is now run more by Australians for Australians'. In some respects he may be right. There is clearly a higher level of Australian content on the ABC in prime time television than was the case in the past. But it is Mr Hill's view of what is Australian that is in question as far as the question of `Australians running the ABC is concerned'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its charter, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has as its function `to provide broadcasting programs and television that contribute to a sense of national identity and inform and entertain, and reflect the cultural diversity of, the Australian community'. What Mr Hill tends to reflect in his approach to the obligations imposed on the ABC by its charter is a view of the nation that is heavily concentrated in the south-eastern seaboard. It is the same view that is exposed time and time again in the policies and approach of the federal Labor government and of his mates in the ALP, specifically in the New South Wales Right&mdash;the Graham Richardson view of the world, which is shared by his successor, Little Richo, the Chief Government Whip. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I first came to the House of Representatives, I was astounded at the almost total absence of news from my home state on the local and national media. There is little to no real concept of the events in the western third of our continent on the part of those who are responsible for the compilation and dissemination of news stories. The press gallery's view of the world, for instance, is almost obsessed with the daily goings-on in the national capital&mdash;and even that is more or less limited to Parliament House and its environs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lack of understanding of the importance of regional events in the social, political and economic life of the nation is most obvious when you look at the use of the word `national' as a prefix for a news service for our national broadcaster.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the coalition spokesman on communications, Senator Alston, put it in a recent interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, the ABC has a charter obligation `to reflect the cultural diversity of the Australian community', and there are community concerns that `it is not measuring up to its charter obligations'.

As early as 1970, Alvin Toffler was examining the trend towards splintering or demassification of the media. He explored the future trajectory of media programming and delivery and concluded that the trend was more towards the plural than the Orwellian vision of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1984 </EMPHASIS>with its unceasing propaganda screeching from the ever present telescreen in every household. `Interactive', in Orwell's nightmare view of the world, was limited to the Thought Police watching citizens via the telescreen and regularly stamping on any manifestations of independent or non-conformist behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Toffler's prophecies in this case have turned out to be closer to reality than those of most of his contemporaries. Media, print and electronic, is becoming more and more Balkanised as subculture after subculture demands entertainment and information that reflect their own lifestyles and view of the world. The sweeping anticommunist movements that triumphed in the 1980s in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were stimulated and fed by the fingers of sound and vision coming from the pluralist West. The fax machine, video recorder and personal computer became the new weapons of freedom and self-determination as citizens of formerly repressive and collectivist societies clamoured for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Romania, for example, it is ironic that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dallas</EMPHASIS>, a program that the Ceaucescu regime hoped to use to pacify its people, became a striking symbol of the West to a materially deprived population. In the West, cable TV and the newer services available in the information highway are demonstrating that consumers want their thing, not a monolithic service provided from one source. The trend is towards fractionalisation of messages, not centralisation as in the case of the ABC's proposal. Tasmanians, Queenslanders, South Australians and Western Australians are more aware of their regional identity and are demanding services that provide the information and entertainment relevant to their lifestyles and location. A one source national news system is an anachronism&mdash;it is just not relevant to the needs of a modern, dynamic, pluralist and multicultural Australia. </PARA>

In the main, Australians do not begrudge that expenditure, but they do want value for money. They do want relevance. They want a service that is relevant to their thing.

But for their news, they want clear, concise information about the area in which they live as well as the wider community and the nation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) condemns the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's proposal to alter the format of the evening news and the 7.30 report&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will go to the detail and the merits of that motion in a moment. First, a fundamental point needs to be made. Those opposite have the nerve to come into this chamber and talk about the ABC, its standing as a national broadcaster and its capacity to service regions and states. What did they take to the last election? The old Acme Fightback. What did they stand for at the last election? Both the honourable member for Moore and the honourable member for Stirling campaigned on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Fightback, at page 247, under `Communications'. The cant and the hypocrisy that they come into this House with shows they have a complete nerve and no standing whatsoever to talk about this matter. Page 247 of Fightback states that they were committed to the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition parties will ensure that all Australians receive value for money in public spending on ABC and SBS through the achievement of greater efficiency and productivity in the provision of their services. </PARA>
<PARA>We know what is coming next:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS will be required to make expenditure savings of around 10 per cent of current outlays resulting in savings of about $56 million.</PARA>
<PARA>That worked out to be $6 million for the SBS and $50 million for the ABC. What does chopping $50 million out of the ABC do? It takes away from the ABC any capacity whatsoever to be involved in local or regional production&mdash;not just news and current affairs but any local or regional production. That is what they stood for and that is what they stand for now. Their only previous interest in the ABC has been to cut its head off nationally and cut its arms off locally and regionally. The cant and hypocrisy they come in here with shows their absolute gall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side we have standing. I refer the House to the first speech I made in this chamber. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a strong supporter of the ABC as an important national institution in Australia. Being a supporter, however, does enable one to do reviews, both on the allocation of resources and the quality of outcome.</PARA>
<PARA>What does that mean? That means that from time to time you are entitled to pause and take a breath and see precisely what revenue and expenditure the ABC is engaged in in terms of its responsibilities and effectiveness as a national carrier and in ensuring that it is being sensitive to regional and local concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore, in one of those quaint little ironies where `Moore' actually meant less for the ABC, did not address the facts of his motion and did not establish the conclusions it draws. Let us look at the facts. We know that a proposal was put by management to the board of the ABC. The board did not accept that proposal. The board called for an array of options that it could consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there are now some 14 or 15 options under consideration by ABC management and the board itself. There has been no shortage of gratuitous suggestions, valid or otherwise, made by any number of people interested in this area. I think it is true to say that, as a result of representations made from Western Australia, the board is only too well aware of the local and regional sensitivities that apply to Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at some of the issues involved in this area. The honourable member for Moore referred to one journalist from Western Australia. I will refer to Alan Carpenter, who is a journalist with the ABC and the current presenter of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Perth. He is a journalist of some standing and I believe his views ought to be listened to, but not necessarily agreed with. He is also a good Albany boy so he understands the importance of community service obligations to regional areas and the importance of the ABC's regional commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of ABC television journalists, Alan Carpenter issued a statement in early August when the first proposal was about to be put to the board. I will quote him at some length. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the changes have been poorly thought out and will have a seriously detrimental effect on provision of news and current affairs in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ABC News in Western Australia is acknowledged as a major success. It regularly outrates all but one of the commercial news services in this state and is clearly the most successful 7pm news bulletin produced by the ABC across Australia, averaging 20 ratings points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 7.30 Report in Perth is likewise considered a successful programme with a consistent ratings average of 16 points a night . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both ABC News and 7.30 Report have widespread community respect and support in this state&mdash;support which we believe will be seriously jeopardised if the proposed changes go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing West Australian content to second-rate status of a strictly regional half hour at 6.30 would be a retrograde step.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would also result in a 7pm news bulletin of greatly reduced relevance to West Australians because of virtual absence of West Australian news in the half hour.</PARA>
<PARA>In an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 15 August, shortly after the ABC board had called for an array of options but had not adopted the proposal put to it by management, Alan Carpenter wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody who works in television in Perth would dispute the success . . . of the ABC's 7pm news in this city. Only Channel 7 has a higher audience figure for its news service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being proposed, and what the ABC management is still committed to despite last's week rebuff by the ABC board, will replace a very successful West Australian-based news and current affairs hour with programs recorded in Sydney or Melbourne two or three hours earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These programs will have virtually no West Australian content&mdash;or as little as any nationally broadcast programs carry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time available for Western Australian affairs will be reduced from the hour between seven and eight o'clock, which now includes anything up to 40 minutes local content to half an hour at 6.30&mdash;the traditional ABC's ratings graveyard.</PARA>
<PARA>There are some fundamentally important points there that the board needs to ensure are taken into account. Let us see precisely where that leaves us in terms of the facts and the motion moved by the honourable member for Moore. The motion condemns the ABC's proposal to alter the format of the evening news. There is no such ABC proposal. Any change to the 7 p.m. news or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> is subject to consideration and deliberation by the board. The second paragraph of the motion says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . supports the retention of the existing 7 p.m. news television bulletin.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come to that in a moment. The last part of the motion calls on the ABC board to preserve the regional integrity of the ABC in each state. I would have thought that that paragraph was addressed by the fact that the ABC board has called for an array of options for it to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give my personal view. The ABC needs to ensure two things: firstly, that its national responsibility as a national broadcaster is met and, secondly, that it pays great heed to local and regional sensitivities so that it maximises both the national product and the regional and local product. I have a strong personal attachment to the current 7 p.m. news in Western Australia. I am open to be persuaded, but it will take a lot to persuade me that the 7 p.m. news in Western Australia ought to be changed. That does not mean that we cannot ever review things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the smorgasbord of ABC news that people in Western Australia will see in the course of today. At 7 a.m., they will see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First Edition</EMPHASIS>; at 12 noon, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World at Noon</EMPHASIS>; at 7 o'clock, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7 pm News</EMPHASIS>; at 7.30, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>; at 10.30 p.m., <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>; and, if they can last the distance, at 12 midnight, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Television News</EMPHASIS>. Some 12 months ago, half of that smorgasbord would not have been there. We did not have <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First Edition</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World at Noon</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Television News</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will take a lot to persuade me that the 7 p.m. news in Western Australia, which is very successful, ought to be changed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former newsreader for, and a proud supporter of, the ABC in Western Australia&mdash;indeed, I was an employee of the ABC in Western Australia for nine years&mdash;I am proud to support the motion of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I would bet my position in this House that, if it were decided that all news on the ABC shown in the eastern states were to be programmed in Perth, the idea would not have time to cause debate because it would be quashed. Yet when it is proposed that Perth's news will be produced in the east, nothing is done to stop it and protect the interests of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say at the outset that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Western Australia are productions of the highest quality. To deny Western Australians their service would be another kick in the pants from the troglodytes of the east who probably have not ventured into the west to see how successful these reports are. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper, Mr Alan Carpenter, the presenter of Western Australia's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, who has already been mentioned by the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), asserts&mdash;and it has not been denied&mdash;that the reason for the proposed changes is ratings. Obviously, with failing ratings, and falling ratings, the management of the ABC, which as I said had obviously not ventured west, thought that to save money it would cut back on news services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact it has chosen not to acknowledge is that Western Australia's news and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> have defied the trends of the eastern states. While those services in the east have recorded falling ratings, the Western Australian produced news and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> have recorded increases and maintain a strong and loyal viewing audience. On any given night in Western Australia, 200,000 people in Perth alone tune into the ABC's 7 o'clock news. These figures have grown continually over the years and, whilst Perth averages a rating figure of 20, other cities in the nation average 12 or 13 points a night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By destroying our news and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> by producing them in a state that cares little for the viewing interests of the west, the ABC management is guaranteeing that in Perth viewers will change channels in droves. Alan Carpenter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is being proposed and what the ABC management is still committed to . . . will replace a very successful Western Australian-based news and current affairs hour with programs recorded in Sydney and Melbourne two to three hours earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those programs will have virtually no Western Australian content&mdash;or as little as any nationally broadcast programs carry.</PARA>
<PARA>These points have not been disputed. On that point, whilst it is perhaps not directly related to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ABC News</EMPHASIS> or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, an example of how Western Australia will be disadvantaged is demonstrated by the ABC reporting of the last federal election. As the House knows, we in the west are two hours behind the eastern states and three hours behind when the east has daylight saving. At the last election, before polling booths closed in our state, the ABC was reporting on results in various seats in the east which could have had an impact on our results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some may think this example is irrelevant to this debate, but the message from this is that with the tyranny of distance in our nation comes a massive time difference. If our news is produced in the eastern states, it would make a mockery of calling the program `the News' in Western Australia when it is at least</PARA>
<PARA>two hours old. If news produced in the eastern states is to be shown in Western Australia, then by the time it is shown it should be called `the Olds' because it would not be up to date and, therefore, it would not be relevant. Alan Carpenter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like it or not, we will be stuck with what is recorded in Sydney or Melbourne in time for their deadlines and of relevance and interest to audiences in those markets.</PARA>
<PARA>I wholeheartedly agree with each point of the honourable member for Moore's motion. I certainly register my strongest opposition to the proposal of the ABC management to alter the format of the evening news and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst it might not be in other states, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> is a very successful program in Western Australia. If the ABC management decision were adopted, the content of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> would substantially reduce WA news stories in favour of the eastern states based producers. It should also be remembered that with the size of our state many areas receive only the ABC and, therefore, it is important to maintain local stories in the news. Paragraph (c) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">any attempt to move news production to the eastern States would deprive Western Australian viewers of local news</PARA>
<PARA>If the proposed changes do occur, this will certainly hurt the people in regional Western Australia who cannot turn to commercial networks for local content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australians have a right to local news and they deserve their 8c-a-day's worth just as the eastern states viewers do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to publicly record a number of facts relating to the ABC news and current affairs programs in Western Australia which do not support the original justification of the ABC to revamp its news and current affairs format. It was suggested by Mr David Hill of the ABC that the ABC news and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> had lost about 100,000 viewers over the last year. He made no comment about&mdash;and in this case no exception for&mdash;the Perth audiences. Ratings for Perth audiences show improvements in ratings for the same period for the ABC news and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 report</EMPHASIS> in Perth. Additionally, in Perth there has been no long-term decline in audiences, as experienced by other cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Perth based ABC journalist and presenter is reported to have remarked that nobody who works in television in Perth would dispute the success&mdash;unheard of in ABC terms&mdash;of the ABC's 7 p.m. news and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. The effectiveness of the present arrangements, while not perfect, cannot be underestimated, especially in a state with only one daily newspaper and where the local community is not necessarily served well by other local television current affairs programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present programming arrangements operated by the ABC in the production and content of the ABC news and current affairs programs in Western Australia strike an effective and beneficial balance between national and local news issues. The local production and bias of news services by the ABC in Western Australia have ensured that local issues are given due consideration and investigation and that the needs of the Western Australian community are properly serviced in the area of news and current affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> No-one denies the diversity and uniqueness of Australia's population. It is this uniqueness that makes this country so great. While the ABC, to its credit, has resisted the tendency shown by other television stations to network and standardise programs, any reversal of this policy will undermine the extensive and important work carried out by the ABC as one of Australia's most influential and effective current affairs programmers. I support the moves by the Western Australian community to criticise the intentions of the management of the ABC with regard to the review of the present programming arrangement and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose this motion. In doing so, I put on the record the very long and strong support that I have given to the ABC in its role as a national, state and local broadcaster. It is very important that the ABC is relevant not only in Sydney and Melbourne but also in Perth, Port Augusta, Brisbane, Cairns, Rockhampton and Longreach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that, if the proposals that are being put forward by Mr Hill are accepted by the board, the ABC will not be the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Fortunately, the board is looking at a whole raft of proposals. But, if Mr Hill's proposals to take local news and current affairs content out of the 7 p.m. news and put it into the 6.30 p.m. timeslot were accepted, the ABC would not be the Australian Broadcasting Corporation but the SBC, or Sydney Broadcasting Corporation. Effectively, the ABC would be destroying its flagship, particularly in the outlying states, where people have an attachment to the 7 p.m. news, which has a balance between national news and state and regional news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a similar situation with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. It is true to say that many of my colleagues in my home state of Queensland have not been particularly enamoured of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in that it has lacked balance from time to time. But just because the ABC, through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>, runs off the rails from time to time does not mean to say that we on this side of the House should not defend the fact that the ABC should have strong national, state and local content in its 7 p.m. news bulletin and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have a hide to come into this House and pretend to defend the ABC. In Fightback, they put forward proposals to cut funding to the ABC by $50 million per year. That would have meant dramatic cuts to the level of Australian content. It would have meant the virtual closure of all news and current affairs production facilities in the ABC outside the Sydney-Melbourne-Canberra triangle. That is their policy. They should not come into the House and pretend to be strong defenders of the ABC when they went to the last election promising massive cuts to the funding of the ABC and maintaining a policy which effectively meant that there would need to be advertising on the ABC to make up for funding shortfalls. They have no credibility when it comes to a discussion as to what we in this country require from the ABC so that people in this country, wherever they live, will get a genuine national, state and regional influence in their news and current affairs programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 7 p.m. news in Brisbane and throughout Queensland has that balance. But the ABC will relegate state and regional news and current affairs, take it out of the 7 p.m. timeslot and put it into the 6.30 p.m. timeslot, which is a time that is not wanted by viewers. That would be the equivalent of saying to people in Queensland, `Why not read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> and the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> every day?' They do not read it every day because it has no regional influence in it. It has no state based news. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC is essentially saying, `We will not give you that in your 7 p.m. news bulletin. We will relegate it to a timeslot which you don't want to watch.' These proposals emanating from Mr Hill will destroy what are essentially popular programs in Queensland, Western Australia and many other regional areas of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The ABC will simply cease to be a national broadcaster under these proposals because it will not reflect the genuine regional and state diversity of this country. People will not watch their news bulletins to get what they want. It would be like Queenslanders reading the Sydney <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> when trying to get a perspective on the Queensland state government. It is simply absurd for the ABC to pretend that these proposals are in the long-term  interests of the national broadcaster or that its interests in being a national broadcaster are served by them in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think that this debate has been significant. It has demonstrated that there is bipartisan opposition to the proposals that have been mooted by the ABC executive and which have been considered by the ABC board as a part of a range of alternatives in relation to the current affairs and news programs of the corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the three government members who spoke on this motion very cleverly tried to conceal the fact that they were in fact supporting it. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) referred to paragraph (3) of the motion, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">calls on the ABC Board to preserve the regional integrity of the ABC in each State.</PARA>
<PARA>He attempted to make out that the ABC board is proposing these changes. That is not only untrue; it is a ridiculous proposition. In fact, at the conclusion of his speech, the honourable member for Perth supported that particular paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only doubt expressed during the speeches of government members was in the speech of the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Dodd). To be honest with honourable members, I really could not understand exactly what he was getting at. I note that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, agreed with me that it was not the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) who made an allegation against the ABC. I think it was a previous speaker who made the statement. It certainly was incorrect for the honourable member for Leichhardt to cast that aspersion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point about this motion is that in Western Australia, and for that matter in South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland, there is considerable concern about the centralisation of the news and current affairs programming of the ABC. That concern is not some sort of idle speculation; that concern comes from reflection on the immediate history of the ABC, because we have already seen this occur in the past. There is a sense of deja vu about this; we have been there before and we have already seen this type of proposal fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the ABC's management is interested in centralising the control of the news content that emanates from its productions. I think that that is very dangerous in a pluralist federal system of government. Interests all around the nation differ and have to be represented by a truly national broadcaster in the programs it broadcasts to the population. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) agrees with that proposition. In his heart, he knows that his own constituents are deeply concerned about these changes and, despite the confection all through his speech, he was agreeing with the sentiments of this motion 100 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point raised by the honourable member for Leichhardt was that somehow we were trying to interfere with or influence the ABC's broadcasting content. Nothing is further from the truth. But there is an obligation on us as members of this House and as members of the Australian parliament to ensure that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation fulfils its charter obligations. As acknowledged by the honourable member for Perth and the honourable member for Lilley, that involves community service obligations that require the national broadcaster to take into consideration cultural differences within our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in modern-day parlance, cultural means multicultural, ethnic or something else. But it also means&mdash;and it is something that is integral to this nation&mdash;the interests of all the states and territories of our great nation. Therefore, in order for the ABC to fulfil its charter obligations, it must reject the proposal of the ABC management and refuse to change the format, not necessarily the time format but the format of the programming and the excision of local content from a program that is going to replace the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) made a very important point, and that was that, with the time differences, there are obviously going to be problems with the end of a news program in Sydney and the breaking of fresh news at the time the program goes to air in Western Australia. That is our concern. It is even worse in summertime, as there is a three-hour difference between Western Australia and the eastern states. We do not believe for one minute that, if a story broke around the country, it would somehow be included in the Western Australian news two hours later. That is our fear. That was our fear in 1990 when these sorts of proposals were first mooted and it is our fear now. We demand that the ABC board reject any proposal that is going to excise Western Australian content from the national news or from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report </EMPHASIS>or its replacement. </PARA>

It was acknowledged widely by his own party that, in an electorate with less than a 10 per cent margin, he would be poisoned electorally and would be probably unable to hold or win the seat.

<PARA>It is not appropriate for any of us to boast, but it is entirely appropriate to congratulate the Australian athletes who won a total of 182 medals, including 87 gold. This is the most won by any nation in the history of the Commonwealth Games. By any measure, the performance was nothing short of extraordinary. We congratulate them on their success and, in doing so, we recognise that success does not come easily. We appreciate the work and dedication of the athletes, the team managers and the management of the whole Australian contribution to the games in securing such an outcome. On behalf of the government and the people of Australia, I congratulate them all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the success of the Australians in Victoria is a reflection of the health of Australian society at large. These medals were won across a very wide range of sports, from swimming to shooting, from lawn bowls to weight-lifting, from gymnastics to track and field, et cetera. It is a reflection of the confidence of Australians in their ability to succeed in the world. I might say that it is a reflection of the pleasure they take in the challenge and in the competition. I think these games have also been a reflection of the values by which we want our country to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian athletes have competed fiercely but in a great spirit. I suspect it was the most multicultural team we have ever sent as well, and perhaps that is yet another lesson about the benefits to be gained from tolerance and openness to the world. I might also say that, in the case of Cathy Freeman, the games revealed that the overwhelming sentiment of Australians is for the reconciliation of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. Never has it been made more clear by the public that the overwhelming ambition of the nation is to succeed at bringing Aboriginal Australians into the mainstream. Never has it been so clear that we are determined to solve this historic problem. </PARA>

Indeed, that is a creed that the government and, I think, the country have accepted for much of the last decade. There is much to be gained from practising tolerance and aiming for excellence, and the general policy in this country of inclusion is reflected in that games team and the success which it has posted. On behalf of the government, I congratulate them all. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to inform the House that the spread of enterprise bargaining amongst workers in the federal system is showing encouraging progress. In total, some 2,400 enterprise agreements have now been registered in the federal system, covering 1.3 million employees; that is, 55 per cent of all federal award employees are now in the enterprise bargaining stream. As even the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has had to admit recently, the pace of bargaining in the federal system has increased since the enactment of the Industrial Relations Reform Act in March of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time there have been more than 600 new applications for certified agreements lodged with the commission and more than 320 of those certified agreements have already been approved. In addition, 34 formal applications for the new enterprise flexibility agreements have been lodged, of which 10 have been approved, including one covering 2,400 employees at Optus. Another 50 or so employers have notified their intention to pursue EFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, it is a very pleasing result and one that contrasts with the pitiful attempts to promote enterprise bargaining in many of the state jurisdictions. Amongst the states, only Queensland has more than 10 per cent of state award workers now under enterprise agreements. It is by no means coincidental that Queensland is the only state which has mirrored the federal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, south of the border in New South Wales&mdash;the state with the oldest enterprise bargaining legislation&mdash;only seven per cent coverage of state award workers has been achieved. There is some 55 per cent coverage in the federal jurisdiction. In Western Australia just six per cent coverage has been attained. In Tasmania, it is a paltry one per cent. South Australia has just enacted reforms similar to those of the other failed state models.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria, agreements in individual contracts remain a state secret. Yet the exodus of 400,000 people to the federal system is certainly no secret, nor are the desperate attempts of Minister Gude to stop his own Employee Relations Commission reinstating compulsory arbitration or the fact that up to 87 per cent of Victorian state employees remain under lapsed state awards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the same people who like to give the federal government advice on workplace reform at gatherings such as MOLAC and COAG. The federal government has got some advice for them: look at the numbers, admit defeat, and follow Queensland in enacting legislation that is complementary with the federal model&mdash;legislation that guarantees award protection and guarantees the application of a no disadvantage test. Only then will employees under the state systems have the confidence to move into the bargaining stream.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is certainly in the negative. Today's figures do show a widening of the current account deficit in seasonally adjusted terms to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion over the month of June. This widening is largely attributable to an increase in the merchandise trade deficit, with imports up three per cent and exports down by three per cent in the month.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This should not be surprising because we have a really strong economy on our hands. What is more surprising&mdash;in fact, pleasantly surprising&mdash;is the degree to which the structural improvement that we have introduced into this economy has limited the rise in the current account deficit. In this sort of environment, particularly at a five per cent rate of growth, one would normally see imports tearing away and the current account deficit getting to the point where it starts to become a critical problem. What we are seeing this time is a limitation in the rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give some examples. The current account deficit for 1993-94 as a whole was $16.4 billion, which was below the $18 billion forecast in the 1993-94 budget. This was achieved despite growth being much stronger. So the current account for the year&mdash;not the month&mdash;was below the budget forecast in the environment of an even stronger economy. The Treasury expects some increase in the deficit this year but, unlike some episodes in the past, the increase is expected to be limited, with a result in the current account deficit of about $18 billion over the year or about four per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: why should this be so? The answer is that we have a more competitive economy these days. There is much more competition than in the past, which is in part because of the government's efforts in knocking over the tariff wall and getting cheaper imports. In fact, we are now 30 per cent more competitive than we were a decade ago. We have been exporting our heads off for years. We can now import compete because of enhanced competition and low inflation. Exports of elaborately transformed manufactures were up strongly again last year by 16 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, today's numbers confirm the strength of the economy. It is the same message that we saw in last week's investment figures. In the month of July, the growth in imports showed up in consumption, capital and intermediate goods. For the three months to July, compared with the same period a year earlier, imports of capital goods as a whole increased by 15.6 per cent. Importantly, the increase was across machinery and industrial equipment, up 17 per cent; ADP equipment, up 12.3 per cent; telecommunications equipment, up 19.8 per cent; and industrial transport equipment, up 35 per cent. These increases have an impact on the current account deficit, but they are there to underpin the continuing growth in the economy from investment which comes from the importation of this kind of capital equipment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition has become rather quiet when it comes to investment. A week or so ago, he and the shadow Treasurer were out there trying to talk the economy down, saying that the investment in business was very gradual. Then he said that it was very disappointing. In fact, investment is up eight per cent in real terms in the June quarter to be 11 per cent higher than a year earlier and he still says that it is disappointing. Every time some good news comes out, he winces because he thinks that it is diametrically opposed to his interests out there doomsaying. As well as that, expectations for investment in 1994-95 were up strongly, supporting the budget forecasted growth for the year of around 15 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what do we have? We have strong growth, a very discernible and strong pick-up in investment and a pick-up in equipment imports. Despite that growth, we have a limited rise in the current account deficit by virtue of the fact that the economy is so much more competitive. In fact, it is 30 per cent more competitive. They are the things that our friends in the coalition know that they could do nothing about. They could not deal with double digit inflation. They did not know what to do with the so-called real wage overhang. They left the tariff wall up for years. During the Fraser years, they lifted it higher.

If anyone wants to tell me that the way to go is to rip somewhere between $1.5 and $3 billion out of the public health system and put it into the pockets of individuals&mdash;not those individuals, by the way, who are pensioners and on low incomes, because they do not get tax rebates&mdash;I will not believe them, because that is not a solution.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many awards, the new youth training wage rates are much higher than the present rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is just not correct. That statement misleads because it does not compare like with like. A training wage for which a day a week on the job is undertaken in training is being compared with a previous set of training wages where two days off the job were involved, and the rate was discounted to 75 per cent. If those opposite want to have the academic argument that 80 per cent of something is more than 75 per cent of something, I will concede it. But let us understand the detail of what we have done with the training wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There used to exist, and still do, training wages for youth under different guises. The fact of the matter is that the take-up for those has not been great. Why? Because the training rates are complex; they are not easily accessible by employers; employers complain about the red tape associated with accessing them; they require the work and the training to be undertaken off the job; and they do not give proper recognition to the enterprise focus, the needs of individual employers and firms in identifying the training they want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has effectively corrected all of these deficiencies. It has simplified the structure. In the process, it has introduced as well the historic breakthrough in establishing a training wage for adults. It has cut the red tape through NETTFORCE and it has provided the ability for on-the-job training to qualify for access to the training wage. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we as a government have committed to funding a capacity for 50,000 extra training places. We are absolutely committed to simplifying the system in a way which did not exist under the previous arrangements and to ensuring that there are additional resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of our commitment to youth unemployment in this country, it is not only the training wage that one has to take account of but also the youth training initiative. This initiative is essentially a guarantee of vocational preparation through the school, the workplace or training programs, or a combination of those, and will not give the young people of this country the choice of exercising the option of the dole. What we are doing is using that combination of education, training, workplace activity and experience to develop the genuine competencies of young people and recognise those competencies around which the youth training wage has been struck.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that youth unemployment is a major issue still facing this country, but we as a government are committed to tackling it. We want to make the entry of young people into the work force much easier, but we also want to make it much more attractive to the employer. The combination of vocational preparation through the youth training initiative, the training wage and the greater enterprise focus will help us achieve it. That is why employers are supporting what we are doing. That is why they want a speedy decision through the Industrial Relations Commission to sanction the training wage. Then they can access it with the combination of other initiatives that the white paper presents. Together this will ensure that we create new opportunities for young people in this country. It will ensure that we do not waste their opportunities and talents in the way that they have been passed over and ignored in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is absolutely wrong and completely fails to take into account the fact that families unable to access HCCA will be able to fall back on the dependent spouse rebate. The people who might lose quite marginal amounts under the new arrangements are massively outweighed by the 800,000 or so people who will benefit from the general rate increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the converse is true. It is certainly not true that people can lose $1,500 as a result of the changed system, but there are certain families in realistic scenarios who can gain in excess of $1,500 as a result of the new arrangements. To give an example, one which bears on the opposition spokesperson's speech the other day about families where one earner moves in and out of the work force, if you take the case of a couple where the wife leaves the work force for a year, say, in January 1995, to have a child and then re-enters full-time work in January 1996, that family would not be eligible in either of the two financial years involved to receive any benefit from the dependent spouse rebate because the income for the part year precludes that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, for the 12-month period from January 1995 through to January 1996, that family would be able to receive the home child-care allowance, which would provide them with a benefit in that calendar year in excess of $1,500. So it is not the case that you can end up $1,500 behind&mdash;that is rubbish&mdash;but it is the case, in quite realistic circumstances, that you can end up $1,500 ahead. That is one example of the very substantial gain that the new structure provides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take a low income family where the primary earner gets $8,000 a year. It might be a self-employed business person; it might be a farmer. Under the existing DSR arrangements, the tax liability of $20 a fortnight would be eliminated by the operation of the dependent spouse rebate. Under our new arrangements, they will have to pay that extra tax of $20 a fortnight. However, on the other side of the ledger, they will benefit from getting $60 a fortnight through the home child-care allowance. In other words, they will be $40 a fortnight better off, over $1,000 a year better off. These are the sorts of gains that people potentially stand to accrue as a result of this changed arrangement, apart from the general increase that the maximum home child-care allowance represents over and above the dependent spouse rebate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question concerning the better cities program. A recent evaluation of the program produced, from the shadow spokesman for the opposition, the comment that the program had produced unnecessary tension between all levels of government and communities and created monuments which seemed to do little, if anything, to enhance the standard of living.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The better cities program reflects the capacity of the government to develop innovative and creative programs that have achieved cooperation not only between the three levels of government but also between the public and private sectors. The initial $816 million investment will generate a total of $1.5 billion in state government investment and local government investment and over $2.5 billion in private sector investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the honourable member for Bonython would attest to the fact that, as a result of the catalytic impact of better cities, there have been significant changes with the revitalisation of the northern suburbs of Adelaide, much greater diversity in housing types, increased levels of home ownership affordability in terms of upgraded houses for low income earners and a demonstration in terms of Delfin of the reshaping of housing stock, which has been important in generating $30 million investment and representing a model right around Australia. Secondly, better cities has generated more than 50,000 jobs. The programs and the output of those programs will mean something like 50,000 ongoing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, it is important to take the example of the Brisbane to Gold Coast corridor and the construction of heavy rail, the most significant suburban heavy rail project to take place in the postwar period. The $400 million project will help to service a shire, Albert shire, which is growing more rapidly than any other urban area in Australia and will double its population to about 280,000 over the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gold Coast to Brisbane railway line will provide a basis for planning and reinforce the SEQ 2000 set of plans, probably the most imaginative set of plans developed by any state government around Australia, and one that builds in a forecast of the need for resource allocation and the need to build that development around rail infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So rather than the better cities program being a program which has resulted in tensions between the Commonwealth and state governments, it has been a model of cooperation between Commonwealth, state and local government. It has resulted in significant levels of infrastructure expenditure, more than $5 billion. It has been a catalyst for significant change. It will have a significant demonstration effect in providing new patterns of urban development right around Australia as we face the challenges of urbanisation in the 1990s.</PARA>

<PARA>As a consequence of reading this advertisement, Mr Hoy made contact with the consulate. In fact, he contacted the consulate in Sydney on a number of occasions and was provided with some information, including a copy of a publication of the consulate entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Canada</EMPHASIS>. This document was published for the Canadian trade offices in Australia. It is volume 5, No. 3 of August 1990.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada's Casey says the above companies represent an excellent "cross-section" of proven franchisors. He is confident all could find master franchisees.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Gerald Corcoran who was named in the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Canada</EMPHASIS>, a publication of the Canadian trade offices in Australia, was a member of the Canadian government sponsored franchising trade mission to Australia the following month, September 1990. The trade mission, including Mr Corcoran, was provided with substantial assistance by the consulate, including office and secretarial services and public relations support. I am informed that meetings were conducted within the consulate premises and agreements entered into within them. As late as June 1991, I am informed that the Canadian consulate in Sydney was still providing support for Mr Corcoran. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of these arrangements and negotiations, Mr Hoy's company, Crestcon Pty Ltd, entered into an agreement with Video Impact as a franchisee for the franchise of video cassette covers and their advertising system in Australia. A payment of $175,000 was made to purchase a video master for the purpose of manufacturing video covers. I am informed that this payment was made and the contract entered into at the Canadian consulate in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that this contract was made as a consequence of a series of representations made by Mr Corcoran to Mr Hoy both in the advertisement I have referred to and also directly. The representations included information on the nature and usage of the video cassettes, that there was a current market establishing the effectiveness of these cassettes, the frequency of hire of the latest release video cassettes, the establishment in Australia of a national management and marketing organisation and also that major high profile companies such as Coca Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds and Nintendo were advertising with Video Impact in America. At the same time there were a series of other representations made by Mr Corcoran to Mr Hoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that these representations, and in fact the whole business, are misleading, the representations were false and the arrangement is nothing more than a sham. When searches were made in Canada subsequent to the passing over of $175,000 on the basis of these representations, it was discovered that the only address given for this company was in an industrial district in a part of Canada that was unlikely to be the home of an international marketing operation of this nature; that there were no franchises in Canada or the United States and that the companies concerned either did not know anything about this particular franchising operation or had only received a letter from Mr Corcoran and had not taken any action on it themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that the Canadian consulate has been involved in the representations. Not only was it involved in the advertisement which was placed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>; in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Canada</EMPHASIS> bulletin there is a glowing reference to these franchisors which says basically that they have the support of the Canadian government. Mr Hoy went to the consulate and said, `What about this Mr Corcoran? We can't find him. The money has gone missing and this whole operation is a scam. What are you going to do about it?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of representations that were made to the Canadian consulate by me, Mr Hoy and others, all we got was a reply saying that this is a commercial dispute, that the government of Canada can assume no responsibility for its resolution and that it can make no further comments about the matter. When the Australian government was contacted about this matter, all we got from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, was a statement which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On receipt of your letter of 13 December, officers in my Department sent a copy of it to the Canadian High Commission with a request for comment. None was forthcoming from either the High Commission in Canberra, or the Consulate-General in Sydney and there has been no further contact with Canadian representatives on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>As a consequence of the complaints made to the consulate in Sydney, it has said that it accepts no responsibility at all for this matter, even though it provided the mechanism, the means, the place where the business was done and the support for this operation in the first place. When some efforts were made to issue a writ against the Canadian consulate, it said that it was not prepared to accept a writ at all. In a letter dated 18 June 1993, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Canadian Consulate General is not willing to accept service of a Writ. Should an action be introduced, this office will claim Consular Immunity.</PARA>
<PARA>Prior to that, when complaints were first made to Canada, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to your written and verbal comments concerning your experience with Video Impact in the course of commercial negotiations toward a franchising agreement, our colleagues in Ottawa have found no  adverse comment or irregularities regarding Video Impact's commercial conduct in Canada.</PARA>
<PARA>People from Australia who went to Canada could not even find Video Impact&mdash;let alone find any irregularities. The Canadian consulate owes a much better explanation than that which it has provided at present. In fact, no Canadian franchisers have been able to be found. Mr Corcoran is not a franchiser. The Canadian consulate has simply accepted his word. Perhaps it has written in its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Canada</EMPHASIS> bulletin what he provided for it in the first place. No telephone listing could be found in Canada for this business at all. All the Canadian consulate says is that it will claim consular immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advice is that the Canadian consulate should waive that immunity. I believe that it ought to do so in this case because its representations and conduct have led to the situation where an Australian citizen, acting in the most proper way, has invested $175,000 in a scam which has been aided and abetted by the Canadian consulate. Something more should be provided by the consulate. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade ought to do something more to protect an Australian citizen in these circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance concerns a number of issues raised by the Ukrainian community of this country. The last week has seen the third anniversary of Ukrainian independence. A decision was made by the Ukrainian administration in August 1991, which was followed by a plebiscite in December in which 90 per cent approval was gained for the concept of independence from the former Soviet Union. There was recognition by Australia and virtually all countries within a short period after that. The last week has provided an opportunity to reassert, as Australia did in May this year, the integrity of the Ukraine's boundaries, most particularly in the case of the Crimea, where there have been escalating problems with recent regional elections and demands by some for reunification with Russia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took the opportunity at yesterday's Ukrainian Independence Day celebrations, organised by the Ukrainian Council of New South Wales, to quote an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> of May this year. It contained an overall review of the Ukraine which puts very clearly the crucial role of the Ukraine with respect to moves by the more way-out fringe of Russian politicians, such as Zhirinovsky, to re-establish a former Russian empire. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire, at least in Europe. For those Russians who want to recreate a greater Russia, control of central Asia and the Caucasus is not enough. To keep Russia's position as a Eurasian power, rather than a purely Asiatic one, they need Ukraine and the access it offers to the rest of Europe. Without Ukraine, they fear, a would-be imperial Russia would look like a latter-day Byzantine empire, shorn of its most valuable western provinces and doomed to succumb to more dynamic forces from the East.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, this last week has provided an opportunity to continue to reassert a degree of identity with the Ukraine, despite a multitude of problems. Issues affecting the Ukraine include the long-term future of the Black Sea fleet and nuclear missiles, the regional push by elements in the Donetsk region, and Sevastopol. When these issues are accompanied by a very unfortunate decline in the Ukrainian economy&mdash;this now sees as many as 12.5 trillion coupons circulating as money in the country, which has resulted in very serious shortages of a number of foodstuffs&mdash;and wrangling over provision of oil from Russia, the picture is somewhat worrying for those people who assert support for the Ukraine's continued existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the reality is that this country has Europe's fifth largest population and, geographically, it is a very significant country within the continent. Over the last few years, we have had the opportunity to take up a number of issues with the Australian government that relate to the needs of both the Ukraine and the Ukrainian citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that, in the recent budget, the government did renew the APTEA funding, which is a training scheme for eastern Europe that last year involved five Ukrainians who gained training in management practices through work experience. A further three Ukrainians will be involved in this scheme in each of the next two years. That renewal was very valuable. It typifies this government's support for a number of international funding organisations that are helping in the reconstruction of the Ukraine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the continuing issues that I wish to raise today concerns representation in Kiev. A series of letters by members of parliament have been answered with a response that the place can be served very well by Moscow. Various letters have also asked why people in the Ukraine should object to going to Moscow because, after all, Albanians and Romanians have to go to other countries and the Scandinavians are in a similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that we are talking about a very changed circumstance. We are talking about a nation with in excess of 52 million people. It could be that to some people the statistics with respect to the number of visas that are currently being processed in Moscow&mdash;it was last reported as being 20 per cent of the total visa issue&mdash;might not be a good enough reason to locate Australian based staff there rather than to just rely on the consul. As I said, I think we are inclined to get into a time warp which says, `As it has been part of the Soviet Union for so long, why should we do it? We're getting out of Europe; we're focusing on Asia.' People can come forward with cases of a number of European countries with populations of 10 million or less which suffer the same predicament. But, quite frankly, I think we have to start recognising the reality of the Ukraine's population and the number of its citizens in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Related to this failure to increase our presence is the degree of inconvenience that it is causing those people who are trying to come to Australia on tourist visas and those people who have other migration needs. They are forced to pay for a courier service. Until recently, before the government rectified this matter, they had difficulties with a payment that the consul sought for a combined courier and document provision. Because of the difficulties of hard currency in the Ukraine, many people have had to go to Moscow and basically camp on the streets overnight to get this service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that we are focusing on Asia&mdash;and no-one is condemning that&mdash;and despite the fact there has been a pull-back in our representation in Europe, perhaps the time has come for a reallocation within that continent and for a greater emphasis to be placed on the Ukraine. We have a very committed diaspora in this country in that, despite the current financial difficulties and crisis in the country, we do seek to be part of economic cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the government should look at the question of granting aid to this community. I am pleased to say that there has been a recognition of a need there, but this year's allocation was reduced, at least in Sydney, from a full grant to half a grant. Once again, I think there are plausible, viable arguments up-front, such as that the community is fairly small compared with others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have to recognise, as the government has in other spheres, that 75 per cent of the Ukrainian born population are over 60 years of age, according to the last census, which indicates a particular need. When we relate that to their own peculiarities&mdash;many of them came here as displaced people after the Second World War; they did not come as family units, they came as individuals; and many of them were in areas such as the Snowy Mountains and what is now the Bathurst-Orange region&mdash;perhaps these individuals need a lot more assistance in coming to urban areas and concentrating resources. There is a very real need in the community. There is a very strong argument that they do need this service. They are distinct from the Russian community, and the government should recognise this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express my dismay that the National Food Authority is currently circulating a draft variation to the Australian food standards code to double the maximum permitted concentration of cadmium in peanuts, rice and wheat. This action is being taken not to benefit Australian industry or our consumers but to facilitate access to the Australian market by cadmium contaminated imports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cadmium is a naturally occurring metal and cannot be removed from the environment. However, it can accumulate in the body and, with excessive intake, gradually poison the system. So it is important to minimise human exposure to it wherever that can be achieved. Health authorities believe that long-term exposure to cadmium can cause irreparable kidney damage and there is also concern that high cadmium levels may be a significant factor in the early onset of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally speaking, Australian producers have few problems with cadmium concentrations in our food. The low level of cadmium in Australian produced foods is of obvious benefit to Australian consumers and is also a natural competitive advantage. Low levels of cadmium can be sustained only with careful management and effective monitoring of production areas. Australian farmers and food producers should be encouraged and rewarded for their efforts in limiting the amount of cadmium in local food. But, instead of being proud of this achievement and endeavouring to build on Australia's success in this regard, the National Food Authority is now proposing that we abandon these achievements and relax the permitted level of cadmium concentrations in food products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the centre of the argument is the peanut industry. Most Australian peanut producing areas, including the major production area of south and central Burnett in my own electorate, have little or no difficulty in producing peanuts within the maximum permitted concentration of cadmium of 0.05 milligrams per kilogram. However, other producing countries, particularly China but also the USA and Africa, consistently have cadmium levels which do not meet the Australian standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 29 January 1994 by rural editor Gordon Collie, and based on information contained under freedom of information legislation, it was revealed that in 1992-93 more than six per cent of imported food consignments tested by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service in high risk categories failed to pass health and quality checks. More than 3,700 shipments of food in risk categories were tested at point of entry and of these 230 failed to comply with Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be acknowledged that any sampling system will be less than perfect and no doubt many other contaminated shipments were able to slip through the checking system undetected. And the majority of lower risk imports are not tested at all. The quantity of food imported into Australia which does not meet Australia's health standards is unacceptably high. Consumers should always be aware of this fact when they buy imported products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though peanuts are comparatively a small food import, 54 of the rejected samples in 1992-93 were peanuts&mdash;well above the next highest offenders, which were, perhaps not surprisingly, seafoods. The most common reason for the rejection of peanuts was, by far, unacceptably high levels of cadmium and, by far, the worst source of rejections was China. Breaches ranged from 0.06 to 0.25 milligrams per kilogram, up to five times the accepted Australian standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chinese peanut exports to Australia have become infamous over recent years for their poor quality. Not only have they had cadmium and other contaminants but also they often have inconsistent appearance and flavour and very poor shelf life. The import of Chinese peanuts has already done substantial damage to the reputation of peanuts in this country as a tasty, nutritious and quality food. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chinese peanuts can only find a market in this country because of their low price, and in a country like China that price exists only because of the high level of subsidies provided by the Chinese government in production, marketing and transport. But these dumped, poor quality peanuts also consistently contain high levels of cadmium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of seeking to source imported products from other producing countries which can meet Australia's maximum permitted cadmium concentrations, the Food and Beverage Importers Association lodged an application&mdash;No. 208&mdash;to raise the maximum permitted concentrations of cadmium in Australia. The National Food Authority seized on its application, which originally applied only to rice crackers, to review permitted cadmium levels in all cereals, legumes and pulses and has now circulated a draft proposal recommending the doubling of permitted cadmium levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Food Authority argues that 0.1 milligrams per kilogram is the international standard. This standard is set at that level not because it has been proven safe but because producers in some countries do not want to undertake the necessary measures to reduce their cadmium concentration. Once again, the National Food Authority has put other factors ahead of the health and public safety of Australian consumers and the interests of local industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australian consumers get to know that, in future, peanuts can have double the level of cadmium they have at present, there is a risk they will choose to eat other foods, thus damaging not just the polluted imports but also the local industry, which would still be capable of producing low cadmium peanuts. The President of the Burnett Zone of the Queensland Graingrowers Association, Mr Trevor Rook, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can't understand why the National Food Authority would be pushing to double the acceptable level of cadmium in a product which boasts a clean, green and healthy image, both here on the domestic market and overseas. As a peanut grower I am proud of our high standards and clean image. From a consumer point of view, it must be a crazy proposal.</PARA>
<PARA>The cadmium scandal demonstrates once again that the only way Australian consumers can guarantee getting food products which meet high health standards is to buy food grown in Australia. Kingaroy's claim to producing the world's best peanuts is no idle boast. But with labelling laws as they are in Australia at the present time it is often difficult to know whether food being bought in this country is indeed Australian. The proposed amendments to labelling laws which are currently before the parliament will not adequately resolve country of origin issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is true that the major, very powerful supermarket chains, with their generic brands, provide much of the impetus to import cheap, low-quality food products into Australia, they are not the only offenders. Recently on an Ansett Airlines flight I was handed peanuts which were labelled `Packaged in Australia from Australian or imported ingredients'&mdash;a give-away that the contents of the packet were indeed imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of concern is what happens to food imports which are condemned by AQIS as not meeting Australian standards. In a letter to Mr Gordon Collie of 22 April 1994, Mr John Merton, an assistant director of AQIS, said that between 1 July 1993 and 17 March 1994 `there had been 142 instances recorded where imported foods did not comply with Australian food safety or food standard requirements'. Of these 142, only 33 were destroyed. A further 32 were re-exported in the hope they might slip through some other country's import inspection arrangements and be served up to consumers somewhere else. In 36 instances the goods were still being held pending a decision to destroy or re-export. Perhaps most alarming of all is the fact that in 20 cases the goods had been released after sampling but before the results were to hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these instances, AQIS merely notified the state authorities of the failures. As Mr Merton confirmed in his letter, `AQIS is unaware of what action, if any, was taken.' In fact, most state health authorities have an abysmal record of enforcing National Food Authority regulations. Recently Mr Collie told a meeting that the states often did little or nothing to recover the food imports which had failed AQIS tests. The products end up being sold to unknowing consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian farmers are able to supply to consumers peanuts with very low levels of cadmium contamination. That provides real benefits to the health of Australian consumers. There is no sensible reason why these benefits should be compromised to accommodate the wishes of a few rogue importers. I call on the National Food Authority to entrench the highest reasonably achievable standards for Australian foods and to reject the current needless push to accommodate low-quality imports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter I wish to refer to today is the continuing tragedy in East Timor. Successive Australian governments have in effect accepted the Indonesian invasion and subsequent devastation of the people of East Timor. Today I wish to place on record my disagreement with the position that has been adopted by all of the Australian governments that have held office in the time since the Indonesian invasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial justifications that were put forward in opposition to anything being done by Australia in any form to resist the Indonesian invasion were that there was potential for a so-called communist enclave to develop in an independent East Timor; that an independent East Timor would be economically unviable; and that only a minority of the East Timorese people were committed to independence. Time has proved all of these purported justifications to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our region there are many nations which are significantly smaller than East Timor. Although they all have economic problems, as indeed do we, they clearly are not economically unviable. The collapse of the Eastern bloc removes any real justification of the communist issue&mdash;if it ever was a justification. Events have clearly proved that the overwhelming majority of East Timorese people genuinely do desire national independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of very few countries throughout the world that give legal recognition to Indonesia's control of East Timor. The reason why we do that is abundantly clear: self-interest. In order to be able to found a strong legal base for the Timor Gap treaty, it is necessary for us to legally recognise Indonesian control of East Timor and the associated seabed, which of course is all important with respect to the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 6 June this year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) described the treaty as `a logical corollary of Australia's recognition'. He stated that there were `questions of basic Australian national interest involved' and that `resources to which Australians were entitled were locked up pending resolution of the issue'. Finally, he said, `It increased our capacity to be influential on other issues, including human rights.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps also worth noting that, when questioned about the situation in East Timor in another context, Senator Evans stated, `The world's a pretty unfair place.' I would suggest that these comments are unfitting for Senator Evans, who I think has been an excellent foreign minister. Certainly, the comments are not in keeping with his efforts in many other areas, particularly in the area of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that, in effect, the Timor Gap treaty legitimises mass murder and that it has been erected on the basis of the devastation of the East Timorese people. Yes, national interest is involved. Yes, a very substantial amount of potential revenue will accrue to the Australian people as a result of exploiting the Timor Gap territory. The question we have to ask is: what price are we paying, morally, for doing so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we took these arguments to their logical extension, we might want to invade and colonise&mdash;or recolonise&mdash;some of our immediate neighbours and enslave some of the peoples. That probably would produce some pretty good economic results as well. But whether Australians would consider that to be compatible with some of the values upon which this country is built is another question. I would seriously contend that the Timor Gap treaty is not in accordance with the values which we, across both sides of this House, hold as fundamental to Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent times, the Dili massacre, the show trial and imprisonment of Xanana Gusmao and the never ending flow of refugees, both directly and indirectly, from East Timor give the lie to claims that things are normal in East Timor and that the integration is proceeding okay. I was at a function recently where Catholic Bishop Deakin, who had recently returned from East Timor, gave a description of a man who showed his back, with dozens and dozens of cigarette butt burns on it, having recently been tortured. This is just one small illustration of the types of things that are still going on in East Timor. He also recounted some of the tribulations that Bishop Belo, a very brave and very committed person, is undergoing in his attempt to reach some resolution of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What results for the East Timorese people has our supposed position of constructive engagement actually delivered? How can we possibly say that things would have been worse had it not been for Australia pursuing a policy of constructive engagement with Indonesia and eschewing a harder line such as I would pursue? To be fair to the government, and to Senator Evans, we have made it plain that we disapprove of many of the things that have occurred in East Timor, and the complaints that were put forward with respect to things like the Dili massacre were quite strident. I do not take the view, as some do, that the Australian government is absolutely compliant, but I think there is room for considerable improvement. We could ratchet up our position to a much stronger and a much more honourable position than that which we hold at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical questions are: what has our soft line achieved, and what evidence is there of less suffering, of better human rights and of greater reconciliation? The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) indicated that human rights are now improving in East Timor. I am not aware of any evidence to that effect. Certainly, indications from people whom I suspect are in a better position to know, such as Bishop Belo, are quite to the contrary. Even the United States, which gave a nod and a wink to the original invasion, is now taking a stronger line on the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that the logic of constructive engagement is disturbingly similar to that which used to be advocated with respect to South Africa&mdash;that is, the way to solve the apartheid problem was to be friendly to the South African regime, and that would enable you to in some way exert some influence over it. Our friendship with the Indonesians on this issue and our willingness to turn a blind eye to what has been done have had no impact on them or on the situation in East Timor. However, we must face up to the fact that to some extent we are prisoners of our past. We cannot simply turn the clock back to 1975 or 1976 and correct the mistakes that we have made, yet we can still make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> International opinion with respect to the situation in East Timor is hardening. American concern is growing, the Portuguese resolve is stiffening and many other issues that have dominated the world agenda, such as South Africa and the Middle East, have at least to some extent calmed down. The spotlight on East Timor will increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Removing our recognition of the legal Indonesian control of East Timor would be a good start. The basis on which we are entitled to do that is that virtually nobody else of consequence in the international community has taken a similar step. We could take the step of, in effect, pleading no contest in the forthcoming trial of the Timor Gap treaty in the International Court of Justice, where the Portuguese have taken a case. We could simply say, `We will leave it up to the court to decide,' rather than defending it vigorously. We could reduce our military interaction with Indonesia on the basis that that is a concrete expression of our disapproval of the behaviour of the Indonesian military. What puzzles me is why we are so worried about offending Indonesia when we are prepared to offend Malaysia about something as relatively inconsequential as its Prime Minister's failure to attend a regional meeting of leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Pilger's recent film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death of a nation</EMPHASIS> attracted a certain degree of invective from various quarters. But it really does not matter whether he or anybody else has exaggerated the number of East Timorese people who have died. The fact is that an awful lot of people have died. Tens, quite probably hundreds, of thousands of people have died. To argue about the body count is absurd and offensive. John Pilger, like many journalists, occasionally lets his rhetoric run away with him a bit and he overstates the case. So what; the substance remains the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see a growing bipartisan attitude on this issue. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) at the table for the opposition today because he is one of a few on the other side whom I consider to have adopted a good view on this issue. I applaud him for it. I would like to see other members on both sides taking a stronger view and getting involved in trying to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I say in conclusion that, in 1975, a previous Labor government made an embarrassing decision: it recognised the USSR control of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, partly on the basis that their incorporation in the Soviet Union was irreversible. That is the same description that Senator Evans has used with respect to Indonesia and East Timor. I do not want to see that embarrassment repeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I ask finally why we do not have any opinion polls about the issue of East Timor. Could it be that the leading groups in both parties do not want to see that happen? We have opinion polls on some of the most extraordinary issues, such as whether the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) should be the Prime Minister or other inane propositions. Why can we not have an opinion poll that asks the Australian community what they think about this? If the indications that we get in the media day in and day out are any guide, the community does not support the policy of the government or the current opposition. It is time that that was changed. </PARA>

I have a lot of sympathy with the views expressed. Having very recently been in Indonesia, it seems to me that there are other problems there of a significant nature. I am talking particularly about the advent of AIDS, which the government there refuses to acknowledge as a problem. It seems to me that AIDS will have an absolutely catastrophic impact on that country in the next decade. We might need to give some attention to this issue because of the proximity and number of people involved. It really will be a serious problem. As I understand it, the government will not acknowledge the problem and is not doing much about it for religious reasons. It will be another major issue for us to debate in coming years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I want to talk today about an article that appeared in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> a week ago by a journalist who obviously accompanied the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on his recent trip to the United States, particularly to the Navaho nation of Indians. The Navahos comprise about 200,000 people, which is something like 50,000 less than our total indigenous population in this country. They have a fair degree of autonomy, based largely on the fact that they signed a treaty in 1868. Therefore, they have never formally ceded their sovereignty to the American nation per se. They have a fair degree of local self-control on a range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that comes out of this article is that sovereignty for indigenous people does not do any harm to the economy and that it is really necessary for the wellbeing of indigenous people. Whilst I personally have some sympathy with that view, I have to say that I do not think it is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The article also points out on a number of occasions what a pity it is that just the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs bothers to go overseas to look at these interests and experiences and states how the coalition would benefit from a similar journey. I have to tell the journalist concerned and inform the House that at the time the minister was visiting the Navaho Indians I was also in America and Canada talking with a number of governments, both state and federal, and indigenous tribes that are looking at similar issues. We on this side of the House are interested and concerned to learn from overseas experiences what should, and often should not, be done to try to improve the situation of our indigenous people. </PARA>

There I met with British Columbia province officials and indigenous people. I then went to Ottawa and, over three or four days, met a range of government officials from the health, housing and employment sectors. I then went to Washington and met with a number of health officials who are looking at indigenous issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I found it particularly depressing that the profile of disadvantage for indigenous people in those two countries is really not all that different from ours, be it in poor life expectancy, poor standards of education, health, housing, employment, domestic violence, alcohol problems, overrepresentation in the penal system and so on. However, a couple of noticeably different trends regarding the approach to indigenous affairs emerged in those countries. It was very clear that the United States makes a very specific distinction between Indians who live on reservations and those who do not. Fundamentally, those who do not live on a reservation do not get any special measures while those who do might well get special measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are certainly opportunities, as this article explains, for Indian nations to receive royalties from various mining and other activities. But it also seemed to me that there is a developing trend whereby the government is saying to Indian nations in America, `You've got your own land. The gaming laws don't apply to you as they do to the rest of the state. Why don't you set up some gaming facilities and generate revenue from that?' A number of tribes are going down that route. I am not so sure that in the long term that will be beneficial to the tribes concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I talked with representatives from the National Institute of Health in Washington, where there are some major research facilities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Canada deals with indigenous people tribe by tribe, whereas we have ATSIC and we try to approach the whole subject on a national basis. British Columbia, where no treaties were signed with the Indian people, talks about its own Mabo legislation. It is going through a very similar debate. It often has a very similar view to the Western Australian government about land rights for Indian people in British Columbia. A number of the indigenous people I talked to in Victoria were just as disenchanted about what is going on with land rights in that country as many of our own are in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I talked to a number of BHP executives in Vancouver. Ironically, I had met some of them on Groote Eylandt a couple of years ago. This is part of the international economy. Big companies move executives around. The view of certainly one of those executives is that there is not the same profit motive here. There is a very firm profit motive amongst indigenous people in Canada. He put that down to a harshness of the environment. I am not sure whether that is right. But he certainly felt there was a distinct cultural difference in their approach to commercial exploration and the revenues generated therefrom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also interesting to note that in Canada the government expenditure per capita is almost identical to the government expenditure on Aboriginal affairs in this country. As I mentioned before, Canada has very similar outcomes in all indicators. We should recognise that North America has a very different history in terms of indigenous people and that many of those tribes signed treaties, which were honoured in the breach more than in the actuality in many cases. Nevertheless, there is a different basis on which the tribes are dealt with today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, I am obviously as committed as most to the importance of land and the very urgent need for indigenous people in this country to accept responsibility for their own future and to have more control locally over their own lives. But I am very wary about too readily picking up on experiences from overseas. It seems to me that we should not just slavishly copy what we hear from overseas because other countries are not necessarily more successful than us, and success can sometimes appear illusory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> which I was talking about earlier states that the unemployment rate of Navaho Indians is 55 per cent, in spite of independence, owning their own land and all the rest of it. The article talks about the problems of the suppression of freedom of speech within the media within the Navaho lands and it talks about the poor range of shopping available and the poor quality of food available. Overall, it does not paint a particularly bright picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area about which I would have some sympathy with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is, as stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, the need to recognise the differences between this country and the States. Rather than blindly picking up what they are doing over there, we have to recognise our own unique profile of indigenous problems and we need to fashion our own solutions rather than slavishly following others. Sovereignty and so on is important; nevertheless, we cannot just pick up the sorts of things that are advocated here, and I think that that is a lesson which we all ought to be aware of. </PARA>

Is that service? I remind honourable members that many of these patients are elderly pensioners who rely on public transport. I am sure that many honourable members know people who require dialysis, know the enormous distress and discomfort that it places on them and know that, afterwards, they have to spend a considerable time in bed, simply because they feel unwell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I set about carrying out an audit of hospital services in my electorate and I found many examples of what I can describe only as subhuman treatment. One constituent, an elderly lady who needed a small operation on her hand, was advised that there would be a six-month wait for the operation to take place at the Mater Hospital in Newcastle. On the day of the proposed operation, she was informed 2 1/2 hours before it was scheduled to begin that it was cancelled and she was told to return in a little over a month's time. When that lady returned for her second scheduled operation, one hour before it was due to begin she was advised that it had been cancelled again due to the lack of an anaesthetist. The operation finally took place a week later. One can only imagine the trauma placed on such a person. Yet this is not a single occurrence; this sort of thing is not uncommon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to advise the House that this particular lady has a husband who is a stroke victim, so you can imagine the amount of planning she would have to do before she could go to hospital. She knew that she was going to be away from her home for a couple of days and, on each occasion she was preparing to go to hospital, she had to make sure that her husband was cared for. This is indicative of the lack of counselling that takes place, the lack of understanding of the individual needs of patients. So much for caring for the individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, overcrowding occurs in the maternity section of the Maitland hospital. Expectant mothers are often held in corridors and waiting rooms in a queue for a bed. On weekends, public holidays and other occasions, we often see wards closed due to budgetary overruns or constraints. If only our illnesses could attack in business hours on week days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have already mentioned, there is a regular rescheduling of admissions and deferral of surgery due to the closure of wards. Cuts in operating times and the lack of specialists&mdash;particularly anaesthetists&mdash;cause major inconvenience to the ailing public. There has been a waiting period of 18 months for general dental surgery, due to a lack of facilities and professional staff. Patients are often  transferred to neighbouring hospitals on admission to accident and emergency, because of a lack of beds. On discovering these inconveniences, my immediate reaction to this congestion was that there must be a shortage of health funds available to the New South Wales government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Then I found some really interesting information. In 1992-93, the New South Wales government underspent its budget on health by a massive $82 million. This year, the federal government increased funding to New South Wales by some $178 million and, so far this year, the New South Wales government is already underspending its health budget. We have found that, since 1991, the New South Wales government has closed some 3,000 beds in its public hospitals. This would tend to indicate that the demand for beds is not there. My survey certainly shows otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fahey government has accused the Labor Party of running a fear campaign on health and acting in a guerrilla warfare style. Yet, from looking at the results of the New South Wales government's health policy, it is questionable whether the monstering is really coming from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 25 August told the story of Mr Allan Mathews, one of my constituents. He is one of 30 people waiting an average of four weeks to access the Newcastle Mater Hospital's radiotherapy unit and one of 10 patients in extreme pain. He was admitted on a Saturday morning with early signs of spinal cord compression. The extended wait for treatment and the spreading of the cancer has now resulted in his becoming effectively a paraplegic. Doctors at the hospital have stated that, if they had been able to provide treatment for Mr Mathews earlier, his condition would not have deteriorated to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a person becomes a paraplegic, not from an accident but merely from waiting in a queue, it must be asked: in what sort of state is health care in New South Wales?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding provided by the Fahey government to health over the last few years has steadily continued to decline, with worsening results. Yet this state government has announced $1.5 billion worth of initiatives as, of course, the election draws near. The Labor opposition has described it as the billion dollar slush fund, and the spending seems to go in every direction except health. The amount of $86 million has been allocated for 1,466 extra teachers; of course, they are replacing some of those that Nick Greiner sacked.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for this opportunity to pay tribute to the 256 great Australians who have just represented their country very proudly. I say 256 because this is the number of athletes who left Australia to represent Australia at the Commonwealth Games. We have seen many obvious successes from these athletes. First of all, there is the medal tally&mdash;the greatest ever&mdash;with 87 gold, 52 silver and 43 bronze; that is a total of 182.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, we have seen outstanding effort on the part of all of them. We have seen incredible personal bests and broken world records. And who could ever forget Kieren Perkins's swims? Even in failure, we have seen some fantastic success from some of our athletes. For example, no-one could say that Tani Ruckle, as she fell over the line at the women's marathon, actually failed; the fact that she finished that race was a huge tribute to her determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as parliamentarians are very proud of the efforts of our athletes. The medal tally compares so favourably to past efforts. In Auckland, for example, there were 52 gold, 54 silver and 56 bronze. The achievement in this Commonwealth Games is the greatest achievement of any country ever in the Commonwealth Games. That is obviously because of years of personal effort by many of these individual athletes and team members, and the great sacrifices that they and their families have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a very special partnership with government. Money is not everything in sport, of course, but it sure helps. Through the next step program and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maintaining the momentum</EMPHASIS>, $275 million has been spent in sport from 1989 to the 1993-94 financial year. That has really helped. In all the studies done of that money that has been expended, there has always been seen to be a correlation between the amount of money and the performance. That has meant not only that there has been personal support to the athletes but, very importantly, that there has been a new level of professionalism in sport&mdash;all the back-up mechanisms that are so important for those athletes to get out there on the track or to get into the field. Those mechanisms are centred at the institutes of sport. I am very proud to have Canberra as the centre of that, but we have also set up satellite institutes around Australia. I think that has worked very well. It has brought with it absolute professionalism in sports medicine, diet, sports psychology, education and, most importantly, coaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us forget, when we see those great individual efforts of the athletes, that behind each of those athletes is a fabulous coach. Coaching is the real essence of success in sport. I particularly pay tribute to those unsung heroes&mdash;the coaches&mdash;who have really worked so hard to make our athletes win through. Management of sport is also really critical, and true professionalism shows when we get the results we have just had in the Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Besides that link with money, there are a couple of lessons to be learnt. Catherine Freeman clearly demonstrated what an Aboriginal child can do. A young Aboriginal woman has excelled for her country and for her people. There is a lesson in that. I do not think we as a nation have done enough to develop our Aboriginal kids in sport&mdash;not just the Aboriginal kids but also many of those children who are living in remote parts of Australia. With the additional money going into sport, a real priority has got to be the developing of opportunities for kids in remote parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other lesson to be learnt is the need for real professionalism, particularly at the very top levels of sport. We expect the best from our athletes. We should also expect the best from our administrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank all the members of the team for their fabulous effort, not just because of the medals, but because they are the backbone of sport as we move towards the year 2000. Not only will many of them continue to improve; even more importantly, they are the role models for our athletes of the future. All the kids who have been watching these great achievements over the past 10 days will be out there trying especially hard for the Olympic Games in the year 2000 because of the efforts of these athletes. That is one of the very important roles of these athletes: to be role models for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, to those athletes and the athletes of the future, I make this promise: the government will continue its partnership role. Recently, we announced an olympic athlete program which will put another $135 million into sport over the next six years. As I said, money is not everything, but it sure helps. Congratulations to all those athletes who have done Australia so proud.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other members of the House, particularly the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), in supporting this motion before the House today. I join with them in commending the Australian athletes for their outstanding individual and team performances at the Commonwealth Games. As one of the metropolitan newspaper headlines screamed, it is raining gold for Australia in Canada. One can only anticipate the glory that is yet to come for Australia at the world titles in the near future and the Olympic Games in Atlanta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dedication displayed by these athletes was admirable. I know that across Australia people were glued to their television sets as our athletes established a new record for the number of gold medals ever won by any nation. I think it has been said by others in this debate that sport is the sort of thing that draws Australians together. Of any nation in the world, I think we are more interested in sport than most other things. Even a former Liberal prime minister once said that the important thing to do was to put sport on the front pages and politics back on the back pages. Unfortunately, at present, his successors are not managing to do that. From our point of view, that is probably not too bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of Australia was proud of the athletes, of the work they did and of the glory they brought to our country as well as to themselves. I think the overall performance of the Australian team says as much for the people behind the scenes as it does for the athletes. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Canberra, talked about the effort that managers and coaches put into these games. The games are not just about any individual; they are a team effort. Even if a person is running a solitary marathon, others are there urging them on. Other people have put a lot of effort into the preparation. They have put in the performance of their lives to ensure that the athletes put in the performance of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The managers of our Commonwealth Games teams play a very important part. In the main, the managers of sport that we have had in Australia over the years have been fairly good. It has been unfortunate that our overall situation in Canada has been tainted by the problems with Arthur Tunstall. I think the Commonwealth Games Association should wake up to itself. If Australia is to put forward very good, high profile athletes and very good technical coaches, the level of management and leadership that management provides has to be up to the same standard. No longer can we just give people a turn because they have been on the association's executive for 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any manager has made more of a muck of managing than Arthur Tunstall. Only one other person nearly made the same muck of it, and that was one of our colleagues on the other side who joined in with Mr Tunstall on one day. Letters to the editor in the newspapers and the talkback radio programs have all shown that Tunstall was out of step in what he thought athletes should do, in what he said about the disabled athletes and in what he said about Cathy Freeman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that all Australians would have thought Cathy Freeman's attitude in carrying the Aboriginal flag and the Australian flag was what we want to see. If we genuinely believe that there should be reconciliation between the Aboriginal people of this country and the people who came here after the British arrived, Cathy Freeman embodies that reconciliation. Here is a young girl who is just excellent. It does not matter what race she is; she is excellent. The fact that she is excellent and an Aboriginal girl, as she has said, gives a lot of hope to a lot of other Aboriginal children. They can say, `There's a very good role model for us.' For someone to publicly try to tear her down was pretty disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy Freeman was the image of Australia. She represented what this country can be rather than what it was. Often in our lives we will see a bit of a sea change. I think after that girl's performance at the Commonwealth Games we saw a bit of a sea change in the attitudes of Australians towards indigenous people. I think the letters to the editor in the newspapers and the talk on the weekend that we all would have heard around our electorates showed that that girl probably did more for the cause of indigenous people in a short time than others have who have worked very hard over longer times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all in all Australia has come away from the Commonwealth Games a far better country: better for the fact that we did well in the sporting events, better for the fact that we can say `We're back up at that high level of international competition' and better for seeing that image of Cathy Freeman wrapped in the Koori flag and the Australian flag. It showed the world that was the future of Australia, and that is a future in which I think we can all take some pride. It is not about which flag she picked up first or which flag some people want her to say she should or should not have carried; it is about the fact that here is a young woman who is a world beater, an Aboriginal and an Australian&mdash;she is the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen some really good things for our country at the Commonwealth Games in Canada over the last week. I commend the athletes, their coaches and managers&mdash;with the exception of Arthur Tunstall&mdash;and all those people who, by being at home and watching the games, added their bit of oomph to make this something that Australians right across the country can be proud of. These young people have shown us what the cream of Australia is about&mdash;hard work and dedication. They have come home with the goods. I commend the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for proposing this motion and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) for supporting it. I hope that when the athletes return they will be given the resounding parade and shower of goodwill that they certainly deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also join in congratulating the Australian athletes on their achievements at the Commonwealth Games. Probably never before in the history of the Commonwealth Games has any country dominated the event to the extent that Australia has over the past few days. We went to the games with high expectations, particularly in the swimming pool. We had high expectations in weight-lifting, and we always expect to win medals on the track and in cycling. I think one of the welcome surprises of these games has been the emergence of Australia as a successful nation in gymnastics. We were all thrilled to see the wonderful performances of the Australian team in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of reference has been made to the performance of Cathy Freeman as an Aboriginal Australian who performed with great success and obviously with great achievement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are always unlucky losers. Our tally of 87 medals&mdash;an unlucky number, is it not?&mdash;could easily have been 88 or perhaps some other figure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Australians enjoyed not only the excitement of an occasion such as this but also the way in which it strengthened our Commonwealth. It is an opportunity for nations around the world to get together. It is no longer all white and British to the bootstraps. These days our Commonwealth is made up of a large number of nations, many of whom have different traditions and backgrounds. Some of them do not even speak English as their mother tongue, as we found out with announcements in French during the Commonwealth Games proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always unfortunate to pick out one athlete as being the outstanding achiever. A lot of attention has been given to Cathy Freeman. She has been given credit for something she is not entitled to. It is not true to say that she is the first Aboriginal to win a medal. As I have read somewhere in the papers, that honour in fact belongs to a constituent of mine. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cherbourg boxer Jeff Dynevor . . . was the first Aborigine to win a Commonwealth Games gold medal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Southpaw Dynevor won the bantamweight gold medal at the 1962 Commonwealth Games in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an honour he will always have. I a sure he will be as delighted as all other Australians that another Australian Aborigine has performed so well in these games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, it is probably unfortunate to pick out particular success stories. But, if we are looking for one, it clearly has to be Kieren Perkins, who continues to break world records and who gave these Commonwealth Games world class by breaking two world records in his fabulous swim. The Commonwealth Games, and success in international events such as this, are of themselves important to our national pride in building a unified nation and one that has confidence in its own future. But the success of our elite athletes also provides encouragement to ordinary Australians to do a little better in their chosen sport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly good that the Commonwealth Games has sports, such as lawn bowls, shooting and others, which do not necessarily require athletes to be super fit or to be at the absolute peak of their physical prowess to compete and to do well. I think that helps to make the Commonwealth Games the friendly games, the sorts of games that involve so many Australians and so many people around the world that they can then identify with those events and feel part of a very special process: the Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever anyone had any doubt about the future of the British Commonwealth of nations, and about Australia's commitment to that Commonwealth, it must surely have disappeared entirely over these last 10 days as we took pleasure at the success of our athletes in this level of competition. It helps to build a stronger Commonwealth, it helps to build confidence in ourselves as a nation and it helps to encourage young Australians&mdash;and, indeed, old Australians&mdash;to participate in sport and to have pride in their country and in what it is able to achieve. </PARA>

I followed it right through and I have learned a lot. I still have not learned the intricacies of scoring in lawn bowls. Maybe that will happen one day. Maybe I will end up taking it up myself.

Some honourable members may have seen the two-part documentary last week on Leni Riefenstahl, the German filmmaker who filmed the 1936 Olympics using a lot of new techniques. When I looked at our coverage of the Commonwealth Games, I saw that those are techniques we now take for granted: the diver on the board, then under the water, and then coming out&mdash;as well as the replays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that struck me was the spirit in which all the athletes entered into these games. I had great pride as an Australian to see so many of our athletes taking prizes, the flag going up and to hear the anthem played so many times. I did remark to several people on the number of athletes who sang the national anthem during the medal ceremonies, particularly the swimmers. The one that really got to my heart was young Melissa Carlton, the disabled 15-year-old swimmer who left her sticks, got onto the podium with one leg, stood there rock solid through the whole ceremony, shifted her balance slightly towards the flag for the anthem and sang the anthem with gusto. I thought, `That is what it is about.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a marvellous idea to integrate the disabled games.

Look at the great success we have had both with our male and female gymnasts; they have been absolutely superb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot let Cathy Freeman go past because she has been the subject of a lot of discussion this last week. I must correct the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss), who said it was claimed that Cathy Freeman was the first Aborigine to win a medal at a Commonwealth Games. This is not so. She was the first female Aborigine to win a single medal. That was the claim that was made, and that is certainly what she did. I would support all of my colleagues who have praised her for carrying both the Aboriginal flag and the Australian flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inferred from the speech of the member for Wide Bay that he was comparing Cathy Freeman to those athletes who have come from other countries, are now Australians and were competing in the Commonwealth Games under the banner of Australia. There is a distinct difference. Cathy Freeman is an original Australian. Her descendants were here long before the Europeans or anyone else who came from any other country. It is worthy of note that she is an Aboriginal Australian who has done so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) has said, young people like Cathy Freeman serve as an inspiration not only in sport but also in life generally. As Cathy herself said in several interviews, she wants her fellow Aboriginal young people to feel that they are worth something; that they can get up and do the things they want to do, whether it is in sport, commerce, education or in any other field. I think that is enormously important. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several people have said to me recently that they do not think we should spend all this money on the Institute of Sport. They think that people who train with their local trainers can achieve just as much and, certainly, a lot of them have. But I think the worth of the Australian Institute of Sport has been well shown in these Commonwealth Games. It has given an opportunity for so many of those people to get in there, train seriously and live a normal life at the same time. In no better way is that shown than with the gymnasts. Most of them are very young. They are still at school and still need a certain amount of parenting. Some of you may have seen a documentary on their training program. I think the Institute of Sport plays an enormous role in the training of these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add my congratulations to all of those involved. As the honourable member for Canberra said, we must not forget the trainers, managers and support staff&mdash;all of those people who ensure that the athletes get there and do the things they were trained to do. Congratulations to everybody who has been involved. Well done. I hope we do just as well at the next Olympics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to follow up the comments that have been made by others before me in this debate. I give my personal congratulations to all those who competed&mdash;to those who won medals of all varieties and to everyone who did not win a medal because their contribution was equal to that of those who were rewarded for their efforts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make absolutely no apologies for being totally parochial in what I am going to say. I am going to refer to the great efforts of the `Ballarat bullet', Steve Moneghetti. Steve's win in the early hours of this morning, which I watched when I was tucked up in bed with my electric blanket on 3 as it was minus six degrees, was a very hot performance from a very talented man. To see his wife, Tania, who has been an enormous support to him, at the finishing line last night was something that would have moved all people from Ballarat and I think it would have moved all Australians as well. Waiting at home is their young daughter, Emma Grace Moneghetti. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to talk so much about Steve Moneghetti in his role as an athlete but as the ambassador of Ballarat and Australia. This is a man who is extremely charming and friendly but, above all, he has maintained and retained his modesty. For any world-class athlete to do that is something of great significance and something that we should recognise  in  this  place.  When Steve Moneghetti runs around Lake Wendouree, he is running for Ballarat. That can never be overestimated. When Steve Moneghetti runs that lap, he is saying, `I am here supporting you and I will push this region as hard as I can.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own children, aged nine, seven and four, affectionately refer to Steve Moneghetti as `Mona'. When my children, or other children, see Steve running or walking around the lake, they ask, `How are you going, Mona?' and they get a response every time. This man has retained his modesty, and I think he is a shining example for every elite athlete in this country. I know that he is very widely respected and was made captain of the men's athletic team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about marathon runners, I would like to talk about Tani Ruckle. That was an extraordinary performance from a young lady who showed quite extraordinary guts. That is the only way to put it. My sympathies go out to her for what she had to go through and I hope that she makes a speedy recovery. When you look at Steve Moneghetti, he has seen the highs and the lows. I am sure there have been times when he felt like giving it away, but he has not. He has stuck to his guns and he has now reaped that ultimate award, which is the Commonwealth medal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of everyone from Ballarat, and I am sure I speak for all Australians, I ask Steve Moneghetti to compete at the next Olympics. I am sure that an Olympic gold medal would quite justly cap off what has been an extraordinarily successful career. My thanks go out to all those athletes who did this country proud over the past 10 or 11 days. They are elite athletes without peer throughout the world. I know that everyone in this House is extremely proud of what they have done. I give my personal thanks to Steve Moneghetti, again, for what he does for my own region of Ballarat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to participate in the debate this afternoon. It also gives me much pleasure to see the way in which we are able to jump across the political divide today to support the Commonwealth Games team. Many have spoken already and more will speak in the next hour or so about aspects of our Commonwealth Games performance, such as the way in which our multicultural society has been represented by the results in Canada. I think that is testimony in itself to the success of the multicultural policies that this government has been fostering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What gave me a great source of pride in being able to listen, watch and read about our performances in Canada was not necessarily the winning, although that has been given a great deal of prominence, but the way in which our athletes participated. Whether they were disabled or able-bodied athletes, they participated wholeheartedly and in the spirit of good sportsmanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there have been those who achieved success by winning a medal, there were many who did not, and one of those was a person from the Northern Territory, Brendan Tennant, who finished ninth in the decathlon. Brendan is young; he is only 21 years of age. I think he can be justly proud of his performance for his country. I know the pride that he should have for himself, and I am sure is shared by his family, is pride that the community of the Northern Territory has as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Northern Territory takes great pride in its high level of participation in sport and has had many sporting heroes. In these Commonwealth Games, Brendan and two other competitors&mdash;they were more successful than Brendan, at least in so far as medals are concerned&mdash;were from the Northern Territory. Brendan, as I said, is 21 years of age and, after putting in a tremendous performance, he finished in ninth place behind the gold medallist for the decathlon, Michael Smith. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christine Trefry, as I am sure you would be aware, won three gold medals for Australia and is from Alice Springs. She won a gold medal in the women's sport pistol pairs, the women's air pistol pairs and the independent women's sports pistol. She was the first woman from the Northern Territory to achieve the honour of being chosen to represent this country in the Commonwealth Games. Christine, along with a boxer, James Swan&mdash;a young Aboriginal bloke from Alice Springs&mdash;were the first two centralians to be chosen for Australia in the Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alice Springs is a relativity small community and to have two of its citizens chosen to represent this country at the Commonwealth Games&mdash;one of them to win three gold medals and the other to win a bronze medal&mdash;is a source of pride and great celebration to us as it is to the Northern Territory generally. I want to say just a couple of words about these two people, in addition to what I have said about Brendan. I think it is important we understand that living in a remote community is not always a bar to achieving the highest level of performance in a particular field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Christine first took up pistol shooting as a hobby 10 years ago whilst living on Groote Eylandt. Groote Eylandt is not a metropolis. She then moved to Katherine and subsequently to Alice Springs. She was able to achieve selection and win, I think, two national championships. She won selection to the Commonwealth Games and at 39 years of age has won three gold medals. She is obviously someone of great ability and has been a great ambassador for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">James Swan is a different sort of person who, from the reports which have been sent from Canada, warmed the hearts of many Australians because of the way he bravely fought in his division as a 57-kilogram featherweight and, whilst winning the bronze medal, lost a fight on what any objective observer would have seen as a disputed points decision, but nevertheless took that defeat very courageously. Although he must have been bitterly disappointed, he demonstrated his resolve, his commitment and his desire to win and to do the best for himself and his country, but most particularly for his family and for his grandmother, who brought him up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult for many of us who live in more comfortable circumstances to understand the struggles that take place in some communities in Australia. For a young Aboriginal bloke like James to become a successful boxer in the amateur ranks in Australia, win successive championships, be selected for the Commonwealth Games and then go on to win a bronze medal says a great deal about him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to each fight I understand that he would go across to his opponent's corner and give his opponent a small memento of Australia. Obviously I do not know whether this was a  disarming tactic, but it was surely an indication of the goodwill with which this young man participated and was involved in his sport. He wanted to achieve the best possible results, he wanted to win, he was committed and he was dedicated. That dedication, I am sure, will do a great deal for James, not only if he continues as a boxer but in his general life. I pay particular tribute to him for his performance in these Commonwealth Games. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We as Australians can be justly proud of our sports men and women. Any casual observer of their performance would have to say that at least the way respected governments around this country have put in for developing the particular ability of our sporting men and women has borne massive fruit. I am sure that our competitors, those people from the other Commonwealth nations and eventually those in the Olympic Games&mdash;if not in the next Olympics, certainly by the year 2000&mdash;will see that the way we have dedicated resources to foster sporting ability in this country will achieve further results in those subsequent games appearances. They will be wanting to learn from us. Certainly there were some observations made by English swimmers about the way the Institute of Sport operates. I am sure that will be the case for our cyclists, most importantly. Their outstanding performance will make everyone take note, as with our weight-lifters from Victoria. We have done a great deal to foster sporting activity in this country. We can be very proud of it. It has been shared by the general community. We as a nation can be proud. </PARA>

Unfortunately, I have seen very little television, but 7 o'clock in the morning seems a good catch-up time. I was pleased at that time to have seen Cathy Freeman. I certainly found no offence whatsoever in the fact that she first picked up the Aboriginal flag, but then so promptly after that the Australian flag, and paraded both proudly. I thought she was a great example to others. The sheer elation she showed and her pride in her country is to be commended. The controversy that followed was unfortunate but I am sure that she has the support of the majority of the Australian population.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eighty-seven gold, 52 silver and 43 bronze is a great record for Australia and puts us a long way in the lead of other Commonwealth countries. In the brief time that I had to watch television it was good to see a reminder of the Commonwealth and the spirit that exists not only in sport but also in other ways. It was good to see countries like Namibia and South Africa represented, both new to or rejoining the Commonwealth&mdash;certainly, in South Africa's case, very recently. Our athletes were a great example to our other young Australians, showing that discipline, working hard and really trying to reach their potential can mean great success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nine gold medals will come home to my own state of South Australia. I have been assured by our sports minister there, who has recently returned from Canada, that we will be holding a reception to welcome them home. That is particularly appropriate. We are rather hopeful that in South Australia we will be able to host the games in the year 2002. I understand we will need some federal funding to achieve that. I hope that the government will be pleasantly disposed to our requirements so we can then put in a bid. I understand that only if the bid is successful will we need that funding. It would be good to think that we could have it on our home turf. It would not be quite so far for other Australians then to travel to see it, rather than having to see it on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, my congratulations to all our athletes who took part, to all those who supported them and to their parents and their families, who would have given huge support in the lead-up to the games, the coaches and to those who accompanied them and cared for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add another dimension to this short debate. Without in any way detracting from the magnificent performance of those who won gold, silver and bronze medals and certainly those young people and not so young people who have etched a place for us in Commonwealth history and, indeed, in the annals of sporting history, I think sometimes we get caught up in the hype of the media and not recognise that a vast number of the team won no gold, no silver and no bronze, yet made an magnificent contribution to the holding of those games, to the spirit of sportsmanship, to their own self-esteem and to the honour of this country. Not much has been said about them today. I think we should recognise them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that we are now winning gold medals in badminton, in boxing again after a long drought and in some of the fields of gymnastics did not come about overnight. It came about by a combination of factors, one of which was undoubtedly the Australian Institute of Sport. The second was the commitment of the governing bodies of those particular sports. The third thing, and in a way the most important thing, was that Australia sent athletes to those lesser known sports over a number of years. They played well, they performed well, they did credit to Australia, but they did not come home with medals. However, they built a profile for Australia in those sports that has been able to be capitalised on by this current team in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure we recognise that a number of athletes who spent two years or more preparing for these games had some sad eventualities. One athlete I would like to single out is Simon Doyle, who comes from my electorate. Simon has certainly made an immense contribution to middle distance athletics in Australia over the last three or four years and to be so cruelly deprived of success because of injury, firstly in Barcelona and then in Victoria, must go down as one most of the unfortunate situations that any young Australian athlete has had to suffer over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I congratulate him.

I want to add my support to what has been said and add that the government is very happy to see that there is bipartisan support for the magnificent effort of our sports people in Canada. I think the games have made the nation proud of itself and proud of its identity. They have made the nation more solid in its commitment to its future. This magnificent victory is no doubt one of the greatest achievements of modern Australian history. Australia has not only come out on top in these games but also come out well ahead of so many countries and it has been a magnificent effort by our people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes people say, `How can we fashion the idea of national unity when we have a multicultural nation?'&mdash;as though the two issues are in contradiction. Anyone who has seen these games and who saw all of our people who stood up, proudly Australian, from different lands and with different surnames and Christian names, would know that they were all united in that they were all going for gold for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a very significant and symbolic point in our history. What it shows is that rather than multiculturalism being a weakness, as some people have argued, it is actually a great strength. It has allowed people from these different backgrounds to come together and to be able to rise within our system. That is what access and equity is about. Included in our system is sport and the ability to represent our nation and actually win and win well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been fantastic examples of that success. Steve Moneghetti was mentioned before. He is from an Italian background. We saw the fantastic performance of Kasumi Takahashi in the rhythmic gymnastics. She is from a part Japanese background. It was well worth watching the grace and elegance of her performance&mdash;it was something else. Our weight-lifters have recently come from countries such as Romania and Bulgaria and they have become proud Australians and have participated in their sport and won gold for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Multiculturalism also encapsulates our indigenous people. Everyone has commented on the great performance of Cathy Freeman. It was summed up on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> where there was a picture of Cathy Freeman and a big headline `Cathy unites the nation'. I think that is illustrative of the way in which our people, the Australian nation, are looking at these games. In a sense these games have symbolised the message of the Australian people and brought it back into this chamber. What do the Australian people want? They want to celebrate multiculturalism, national unity and pride in Australia but they also want to celebrate our respect for the cultural diversity and the different traditions that have made this a great nation and an example to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a wonderful time from a sports point of view and generally to be Australian. I think the big powers in sport that saw the performance of Australia in the Commonwealth Games must be getting a bit worried to see this smaller country with its wonderful effort and its multicultural base coming forward and bringing the best out in people. I am sure that Australia is going to do very well in the Olympic Games in 1996 and the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate everyone involved in the organisation of the games. People have mentioned that the Australian Institute of Sport has done a marvellous job. In some cases, athletes' families have contributed through very hard work and effort to get the people there and to give them the support over the years so that they can represent our nation and do us proud. Congratulations to everyone. The government is very proud of the performance and I am sure the whole of the parliament is proud as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In joining this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, I take the opportunity to speak about a couple of matters that have arisen. I would like to start by addressing the rather peculiar and specific provision in this bill that proposes to fine state governments who have the temerity to do something that this federal government does not like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to sections 25A and 25B of the higher education legislation that was introduced in this place and the enabling section in this bill which allows the government to reduce its general purpose funding to a state if it passes legislation to make student union contributions at tertiary institutions voluntary. It is a fine situation when we have the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) lecturing us at question time about privacy and human rights, but we still have in this House a view that if this government decides someone should be in a union he or she will be in a union. Of course, there is both a human rights and a privacy situation arising there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have considered this issue for a long time. I have an absolute commitment to the right of people to volunteer to join a student union. I have never heard so much rubbish as that which has emanated from so-called learned people, such as university chancellors and others, who tell us why people should make these contributions. They are interested only in protecting their revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reason that they give us is not that this is a great slush fund for certain political activists within the university system. They have to give it a higher profile than that. So they say, `Oh, it's for the provision of services.' That is fine. Services such as cafeterias, bars and sporting amenities are provided at universities. One would think it is reasonable to argue that people should contribute to the provision of these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some students may not drink alcoholic beverages. Some may prefer to take their own salad for lunch because, amongst other things, they are under some financial pressure at home. Some students may not want to pay even the subsidised prices at the cafeteria. Others may not like pies or the food that is presented. Why should these people have to pay for the services? Why should they have to make an up-front charge when they do not use all of those services? There is a very simple solution. Those services do not have to be closed down, as is implied by these highly intelligent people. They can be run commercially and tendered out. They can charge at a profit. Those people who think that the convenience is worth while can use them. Maybe McDonalds or Burger King could get in there. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member cannot tell me that the tucker is much better because I have eaten at the cafeterias from time to time. The simple fact is that those services can be provided on a commercial basis. They do not need to be subsidised up-front by people who do not use them. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), who is a committed proponent of student fees, is to speak after me. He might like to explain why someone who does not use the cafeteria or the bar and who is not interested in the free drinks that are turned on every now and again for political purposes should have to pay for them? It is a simple question. I do not see why that student should have to pay for those services when they can be provided on a purely commercial basis. Those who use them can pay the going price.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to organised sport. A lot of people who go to university do not play organised sport or choose not to play within the university. Why should they have to pay an up-front fee for that service? Why can't the people who choose to be in the footy team, to be in the hockey team, to play tennis or to use other facilities which are provided pay for those services? That is quite reasonable. They are the ones who use them. There is a user-pays policy in just about everything you bring into this parliament today. It is quite reasonable. If certain people do not use those facilities, why should they be made to pay for them? It is totally unsustainable in the context of university life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why people who want to play organised sports should not pay for that service? Those who do not wish to play may have to decide between paying for a pair of shoes for their kids and paying that university fee. Why should they have to pay so that other single people can go out on the weekend and use free facilities provided at the university by people who do not use them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get to the facts. There are people at university today&mdash;and we know all about mature age education&mdash;who are struggling. They have children. You are telling them that they have to pay for these sorts of amenities and facilities when it might mean the difference between paying that fee and paying for a new pair of shoes for one of their children. Any member who believes that is right should stand up and put it on the record. I will make sure that it is well known in various places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to political activism. Any poll will show that the biggest percentage of young people who go to university are political `apathists', if there is such a word. They are totally apathetic towards and uninterested in student activism. They do not want to be involved in the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the Democrats or any other party. In some cases, they resent the compulsion to vote. We tell them that they should fund it. Why should that occur in a free society? There is no reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain state governments, which are elected by the people of that state and which are subject to being kicked out if they take decisions of this nature which are not approved by the people of that state, should be able to make a decision about that. They should be able to say, `This is a user-pays situation. We're not stopping anyone from doing it. We're just going to make it voluntary.' But, no, it does not fit the collectivist attitude of this government on that particular issue. So the states will be punished. You will take some of their money back and give it to those student unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed to see the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) leaving. He was going to wait for me to respond to him. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994 does a number of things. It provides on an annual basis general purpose funding for the states, which dovetails with the Loan Council arrangements with respect to the borrowing programs of the states and the Commonwealth. It provides for the level of financial assistance grants to be maintained on a real per capita basis over the next three years. It provides special revenue assistance for things such as Medicare guarantee payments and the like. It provides $350 million in arterial road funding to the states for the 1994-95 budgetary year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it provides, as the honourable member for O'Connor dealt with at some length, for voluntary student unionism legislation in at least two states to have a countervailing neutralising impact in federal legislation. This is being pursued both in this piece of legislation and also in an amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act, which will be dealt with in this House in the very near future if not later this week. Other than to make a couple of brief comments, I will reserve my views on that matter until we debate the second piece of legislation I referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unfortunate that the honourable member for O'Connor has chosen to challenge me to respond to the matter, has said that he would be very interested to hear what I had to say about it, and then has left. Such is life. I would point out to him that, for all his wailing about how evil it is that university students are being forced to contribute to the cost of running university sporting clubs, his own party, under the Victorian state government legislation, has provided for that to continue. Perhaps he should have a chat to Jeff Kennett about this issue, because under the legislation that the Victorian Premier introduced into the Victorian parliament there were a number of areas where compulsory fees were still able to be levied on students enrolling at universities. The funding of student sport was one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the initial legislation there was a very stark contrast&mdash;a quite obvious contradiction&mdash;between sporting, cultural and artistic activities. Under the legislation, although it was not possible for any levy or fee to be struck to cover cultural, artistic and musical activities, it was possible to cover university sporting activities. Subsequently, the legislation has been amended by the Kennett government to remove that most glaring anomaly and include areas such as culture and music. I would suggest to the honourable member for O'Connor that maybe he should have a bit of an argument on this issue with people in his own party first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also suggest to him that the principle of user-pays that he has advocated is a fairly extreme one which is not taken literally anywhere in our society. I live in the local government area of Moreland, which was previously the local government area of Brunswick. It has a public swimming pool, which costs a bit to run. There is a bit of a subsidy from the local council, although it is a lot less than it used to be. Unfortunately, it is a long time since I have gone for a swim there. A variety of other local council services that I do not use&mdash;and may never use&mdash;are funded by me, indirectly, through my rates. So the notion that we should collectively act to provide services to the community at large, based on some form of compulsory levy&mdash;in this case, rates&mdash;is very well entrenched in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not an absolute analogy, but local governments and the student organisations in universities have many similarities. I would argue that, as social entities, university campuses are in fact very similar to local communities. Therefore, some form of compulsory fee which contributes to the provision of a wide variety of services to students and is controlled by democratically elected students&mdash;roughly equivalent to local or council elections, and with turnouts for voting that in many instances are not much lower than the turnouts for local council elections&mdash;is appropriate. There is no more logic in suggesting a complete user-pays approach in a non-academic services provision for a university campus than there is in suggesting it in local government. I suspect the honourable member for O'Connor may even contemplate it in local government. I suspect some more extreme libertarians in his party certainly would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate on an issue which is connected with these very vital matters of federal-state financial relations; that is, the future of Australia's airports. On the weekend a proposal was floated that would see the state and local governments assume a vital role in owning and operating the airports in Australia that are currently run by the Federal Airports Corporation. Of course, this would have significant implications for the federal-state financial relations framework with respect to grants and loans covered by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of background, I would like to respond to some of the things that were said on this issue by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his speech, to which the honourable member for O'Connor previously referred. I asked the following questions about the proposed sale of the airports, which the honourable member for Werriwa sought to answer. Has the performance of the FAC been satisfactory? What is the overseas experience? Is it appropriate that there should be internal cross-subsidies within the airport structure? What impact would privatisation have? What scope is there for competition between airports? Would the federal government achieve an optimum financial outcome? This is obviously relevant to its relations with the states as well, depending on where the airports ended up as a result of their being sold. What are the implications for workers in those organisations?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Werriwa sought to respond to each of these questions, and I would like to respond to his response. He indicated that in his view the FAC performance had been particularly unsatisfactory and that the PSA was very critical of the pricing policies and investment criteria that had been adopted by the FAC. I suggest to the honourable member for Werriwa that he is overstating somewhat the criticisms of the PSA. Yes, it was critical, but it did say that it `had difficulty making a firm judgment about the operating efficiency of the FAC' because it very much depends on which indicators you look at. Its conclusion was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of the commercial and financial objectives set for the FAC in its Act, the FAC could be considered to be successful. It has met the Government's target rate of return in each year of its operation and it has paid dividends to the Government. Also it is now liable to pay income tax. The FAC has significantly increased revenue from non-aeronautical sources. Aeronautical charges have not risen significantly in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA>A recent Bureau of Industry Economics study has indicated that our airport charges are amongst the lowest in the world and our service levels and efficiency are amongst the best. The fundamental point here is that, to the extent that there are problems with our airports as they currently are managed, those problems can very easily be addressed by the government without its having to sell them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is overseas experience. The honourable member for Werriwa indicated that there are several precedents for private ownership in the United Kingdom, the United States and Asia. Certainly in the United Kingdom that is the case, but I would be interested to hear where are the other precedents in the United States and Asia. I am sure that the honourable member for Werriwa is right, but in the research that I have done I have not discovered any. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested to find that in 1991 even the Bush administration opposed and blocked the proposed privatisation of a major airport in New York state for a variety of reasons similar to the concerns that I have with respect to the proposal in Australia that is before us at the moment. So I think the sweeping statement that private ownership exists to some significant extent in the United States and Asia really requires some greater indications of which airports and on what basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member went on to say, `Those countries have demonstrated that private ownership of airports leads to a better incentive for urban and regional development surrounding the airport site.' Again I am prepared to give the honourable member the benefit of the doubt and ask for further information and evidence to back up that statement, but certainly the research work that I have done suggests that it is difficult to see how that can be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member cited the Cairns airport as an illustration of how this can occur, and already has occurred, in the Australian context. The point he missed about Cairns is that it is still under public ownership, albeit local public ownership&mdash;as are most of the non-FAC airports across Australia. Obviously we have to acknowledge that the strength of Cairns airport and its custom substantially reflect the popularity of Cairns as a tourist destination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly you can argue&mdash;and I think it has to be conceded to some extent&mdash;that there is a synergy between the two. A higher quality of airport service provision may have been a contributing factor, at least on the margins, to Cairns's growing popularity as a tourist destination, but I doubt whether it is anything more than on the margins. The third question addressed by the honourable member was cross-subsidies within the existing FAC network. They occur at three levels: from the major airports to the smaller airports, on a regional basis; from non-aeronautical revenue to aeronautical costs; and from the major passenger and freight air traffic to general aviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member described the cross-subsidies regime that operates at the moment as `flawed'. I think that is an arguable point. I think there are certain points which could be put to suggest that that may be the case in some instances. However, the government could solve that problem&mdash;if there is a problem&mdash;tomorrow. We do not even need to legislate. The minister has the power to direct the FAC, in the public interest, under the existing legislation. Even though there are limitations on that power, if those limitations came into play, we could legislate. Even if we accept that the cross-subsidies regime does have problems, we can solve those problems without having to go to the extreme of selling the airports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth pointing out that in at least one instance&mdash;that is, cross-subsidisation from non-aeronautical fees to aeronautical charges&mdash;it is common around the world. It is a standard picture. Where it is particularly happening more than anywhere else is in Britain. The British Airports Authority is relying increasingly on revenue from shopping malls and the like to bolster its airport services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The comments by the honourable member with respect to flawed accounting and a lack of transparency on the part of the FAC may well be true. But, once again, the answer lies in our own hands; we do not have to go to the extreme of selling the airports in order to fix it. He said that, stripped of debt, only two of the existing FAC airports would be non-profitable. That is true. In fact, it may well be that none of them would be non-profitable and that they would all be profitable, but it is a fairly artificial way of looking at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the future, I look forward to people fronting up at the Federal Court for bankruptcy proceedings and saying, `If it was not for the debt, we would be perfectly viable.' Debt is obviously a logical part of a corporate structure both in the public and private sectors. To suggest that we look at these airports and forget about the debt is a very artificial way of looking at the picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The suggestion that the rich benefit from  cross-subsidies is a little difficult to sustain because it ignores the question of who pays the cross-subsidies. By and large, those who are better off in the first place pay the cross-subsidies which head to regional airports. It is also worth pointing out that not only rich consumers benefit from cross-subsidies. For example, the increased freight costs that are part of any cross-subsidy situation obviously flow through into the price of products that are purchased by the whole community. So ultimately you could argue that an increase in freight costs for some of the smaller regional airports will be borne in a similar way to a GST by people in the community. So the issue needs closer examination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the impact of privatisation, the honourable member for Werriwa suggested that we missed our chance to tackle these issues when the FAC was corporatised and that, in a sense, corporatisation was all about making the airports run in the market like private enterprises. That is an inaccurate description of what the government did when it set up the FAC. The primary thrust of the FAC legislation was to remove the subsidisation of our airports from the general revenue. Something like $1.5 billion over the preceding 12 years had gone into our airports from non-airport derived revenue&mdash;namely, from the general taxpayer. That was the primary thrust of the legislation. The honourable member for Werriwa stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was at that point that the government said that this is an economic and transport activity that can operate according to the rules of the private market.</PARA>
<PARA>That is obviously an incorrect statement. If it were correct, we would not now be having this debate. Quite clearly, there are substantial restrictions, such as cross-subsidies, on the operation of the FAC in a private market sense. So the suggestion that we did it all back then is not correct. The honourable member also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there should not be any scaremongering regarding the extent of increased charges&mdash;they are spread across the industry and have a marginal impact on airport consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>That is basically a statement which implies uniform pricing, which is exactly what we have at the moment. Increased charges will ultimately hit on specific regional airports if we free up the airports from the current cross-subsidy arrangements. To suggest, as the honourable member does&mdash;</PARA>

To suggest, as the honourable member for Werriwa does, that the increase in charges would be distributed across all airports is simply not correct, because that would simply replicate the existing situation. The problem is that some airports would have their charges go down while the charges of others would go up. I concede that this problem has been exaggerated by some people in the debate. It may well be that we can make this change without the regional impact being too serious. But, quite clearly, some airports would have their charges go up substantially and others would not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Werriwa is absolutely right on one fundamental point, which is that we should be using the proceeds of this sale, if it does proceed, to finance other infrastructure. To be effectively spending this money as current expenditure is absolutely wrong in principle and practically. If we decide that we should sell the airports, we should be reinvesting the proceeds of those public assets in other public assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is the question of competition. Largely I agree with the honourable member that predominantly we are dealing with natural monopolies that have prospect for competition in some areas and at some levels. But it is also worth noting that there are other levels of competition in this area. There is obviously competition with other transport modes. It will vary according to which airport one is talking about. Indirect competition is associated with the costs that are built into particular products by the airport charges. So there are broader issues on the competition front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) has stated recently that the proposal I referred to earlier is contrary to the principles of the Hilmer report. I suggest to him that what is contrary to the principles of the Hilmer report is selling our airports. Once Australian Airlines and Qantas are privatised, we will have a classic model of the `essential facilities' doctrine, which is advanced in the Hilmer report, in place in the air transport industry in this country. Namely, where one is dealing with things like electricity, railways and the like, the natural monopoly components should be in public ownership and the use of those components&mdash;the generation and distribution of electricity or the running of trains on railway tracks&mdash;can be opened up to private competition. Once we only have private operators in the airline industry, that is precisely what we will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Werriwa attacked Professor Bob Walker, whom he described as `Rent-a-result'. I am disappointed in that comment, because it is difficult for Professor Walker to respond. This is a fairly serious charge against him. I have not dealt with Professor Walker before, so I have no idea whether there is any substance in the charge. It is unfortunate that the honourable member chose to attack the author of the report without responding to the substance and putting forward a critique of his conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real value of our airports is open to some debate. Obviously, it is an artificial market construct. But the federal government is saying that they are worth $2 billion. It is difficult to precisely identify their true value. It depends on the conditions under which they are sold. But to simply dismiss Professor Walker's analysis by saying, `He would say that anyway' is a bit unfair. It fails to address the issue of whether he is right. He may be `Rent-a-result' for all I know, but the question is whether he is right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The final area where I have a different view from the honourable member for Werriwa concerns his comments that the Transport Workers Union supports the proposal, `so the main bodies of workers are covered in this proposition'. The main body of workers are not covered in this proposition because the main body of workers who work for the FAC are members of the PSU, or the Public Sector Union, and the AFMEU, or the Automotive, Food, Metals and Engineering Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Transport Workers Union may well support the proposition, because it has interests in those unionists ultimately becoming members of the Transport Workers Union, but certainly the two main unions involved do not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), found that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) was right on at least one point. What a pity he was wrong on all other 200,000 points. I direct my attention in this debate on the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill to clause 15, which deals with the higher education funding condition. I preface my comments by referring to legislation in Western Australia, which is one of the reasons for the insertion of this clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> At the 1993 state election, the Western Australian coalition promised, as part of its education policy, to make membership to student unions voluntary. With its very resounding victory, the Western Australian coalition was given a mandate to introduce its policies, including its policy to provide freedom of association to students at our universities. Section 25A and the proposed section 25B of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 allows the Commonwealth to reimburse student unions for any income lost through the introduction of voluntary student unionism in any state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 of this bill provides that any money paid by the Commonwealth as a result of this will be a debt owed by the relevant state to the Commonwealth. Prior to the Western Australian government introducing this legislation, we had last year the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), in typical Labor thuggery style threaten to fund the student unions with this legislation by penalising the states. I said at the time that it was bullyboy tactics and I must commend the Western Australian government for not backing down on its legislation, despite the federal Labor Party carrying out its blackmailing threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, given the minister's slim margin at the last election and also given the fact that student unions and, in particular, the National Union of Students supported him in his election campaign, I am not surprised that he is using taxpayers' money to bolster the student union coffers, for it is simply a favour he owed them in return for their helping him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is the federal Labor government reducing state grants, if a state government introduces legislation, which it has a mandate for, and giving that money which should otherwise be going towards roads, schools, hospitals and so forth to more often than not an unrepresentative, politically partisan student union. The government has introduced this clause as a means of protecting the income of one of its prime training grounds&mdash;the student unions. There is no disputing that Labor Party members have a vested interest in this legislation; they are using taxpayers' money to ensure they continue to train their future members and so their mates in the ACTU can recruit their future movers and shakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the Western Australian government has introduced legislation which will make membership to student unions voluntary&mdash;legislation it had a mandate to introduce. This will give the 40,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time university students in Western Australia the choice of joining the relevant student union. I must ask: why should those who choose not to join a student union be thrown out of university? The legislation of the Western Australian government removes this ridiculous situation of no ticket, no education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian legislation provides basic human rights, freedom of choice and freedom of association. Students should not and must not be compelled to join an association or union if they choose not to. Compulsory membership of a student union or guild should not be a prerequisite to students being able to acquire an education, particularly when you consider the activities of student unions. The Western Australian legislation&mdash;similar to legislation in Victoria and the agreement between the Tasmanian government and the University of Tasmania&mdash;makes membership of the student associations at those universities voluntary. It forces those student associations to make membership attractive and to be worth joining rather than letting them be complacent under the knowledge that, with compulsory membership, they have a guaranteed income and therefore do not need to represent their membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While a few state governments have tried to make student unions attractive, hardworking and representative, this bill  ensures that the status quo is maintained, that is, that student unions remain politically partisan, unattractive and unrepresentative by guaranteeing their income, even in the event of voluntary student unionism. The bill is penalising those states which confer freedom of choice upon students. It also penalises the people of each state by passing money on to student unions when it should instead be directed towards schools, roads, hospitals and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill could penalise Western Australians to the tune of approximately $5 billion. I must ask: why would most students join their student union when they know that, if they do not, their share will be contributed by the taxpayer and the majority of facilities offered by the unions will still be able to be used? We will see that most students at the majority of universities in Western Australia, Victoria and Tasmania choose not to join their student union, knowing full well that the union fee they should have paid will be paid by the taxpayers of their state. Consequently, the states will lose essential services to the same value because this bill corruptly diverts money from these essential services to the Labor Party's and the union movement's prime training grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is but another example of the Commonwealth imposing its will on the states when it disagrees with the state policy. It is high time that members of the Labor Party realise that they do not have a mandate to legislate on every single issue facing our community, particularly those issues which are the responsibility of the states. Their underhanded way of trying to maintain compulsory student unionism in all states&mdash;which is anathema to the principles of freedom of choice and freedom of association&mdash;are to be condemned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by pointing out to my Western Australian colleagues opposite that, if they support this motion, each time when the Western Australia Labor leader Ian Taylor makes one comment about less money being spent on essential services&mdash;and if our state has lost money as a result of clause 15, which they support&mdash;they must hold up their hands and say, `We are responsible for this funding shortfall. By trying to override state legislation, we have ensured Western Australia got less.' I say again: I oppose clause 15. It is anathema to the principles of freedom of choice, freedom of thought and freedom of association. I reiterate: it is wrong for the federal government to override legislation which the state governments have a mandate to introduce. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In summing up, I would like to thank all honourable members who contributed in the debate. I would like to start on a positive note by pointing out that the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill does give the states considerable benefit with payments linked to not only the CPI as they were formerly but also population growth for the next three years. It also gives states a real chance at looking forward for three years knowing that they can predict fairly accurately and, let me say, with more money than they otherwise would have had, their budgets for the next three years. That is a real positive in this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say only a few words about what seems to have the opposition in a lather concerning the students. The issue here is  very much one of university autonomy. This government considers that it is an important feature of university autonomy that higher education institutions and students should be able to make their own decisions, independent of any government interference, on the provision of services and amenities for the students and the imposition and collection of fees for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Higher Education Funding (Student Organisations) Amendment Bill 1994 and the complementary amendment to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill currently before the House are direct results of state government interference in this autonomy. For example, the Victorian state government has legislated to control the application of student fees regulating which services can be provided. Student newspapers are currently not provided for and, if added to the approval, the state government will control and censor the material published. This government takes the fundamental view&mdash;and we have the confidence&mdash;that students can basically look after their own affairs. They are the ones who are paying the money in. Why should a state government step in in a jackboot style and tell them how to spend their money and what they can spend it on? We will not support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members also stated that they support freedom of choice, yet the Victorian government has removed from students the ability to choose for themselves what services and amenities they want to be provided&mdash;in actual fact, more of big brother. Student unions cannot be likened to trade unions, and this was brought up in debate. What are sometimes referred to as student unions come from a longstanding tradition of student guilds, which are characterised by students coming together to provide a wide range of non-academic benefits to students. The government will protect the autonomy of the universities in their activities on behalf of the students and ensure that institutions maintain an environment that fosters the necessary cultural atmosphere for students to exchange ideas and hold and express opinions in a free and unimpeded manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I point out that the Commonwealth government's position is supported by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the National Union of Students and the National Tertiary Education Union. These organisations support the views and wishes of institutions and students. Consequently, it is difficult to understand why the coalition opposes clause 15. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with what members of the opposition have said during the second reading debate, the opposition remains opposed to clause 15 of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. Without rehearsing the argument at great length, clause 15 provides that any amount paid by the Commonwealth to make up lost funding for student organisations as a result of voluntary student unionism is a debt due to the Commonwealth from the state. Therefore the provision of this clause would allow the Commonwealth to deduct from the grants generally made pursuant to the states grants general purposes legislation that amount of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Placing this matter in a somewhat broader context, we have been lectured in this place in recent days by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), amongst others, about the need for and the desire of individual liberty and freedom but when it comes, in this particular clause in this particular legislation, to the freedom relating to the freedom of association, the government turns a blind eye to this provision. The freedom of association has been stated on a number of occasions in a number of ways. Perhaps it is put most succinctly in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights in article 20, part 2, which states that no-one may be compelled to belong to an association. When we are given lectures generally about the desirability of freedom and liberty, we say that this particular freedom in this legislation ought to apply to student unions as it does to any other association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what we see in a broader context in this legislation is the prescience of Alfred Deakin, who said in the early years of this federation that whoever controlled the purse strings would in fact hold the balance of power in Australia. Not only is the Commonwealth in this legislation taking a unilateral act in relation to the states, which form part of the federation, but in other legislation which comes before this parliament from time to time there is a desire on the part of the Commonwealth to simply concentrate power into its own hands. It is not worried whether it does that through the implementation of United Nations treaties, which involve some exercise of the sovereignty of the people of Australia by those who do not belong to this country, or whether it does it, as in this legislation, through its control over the purse strings. Whichever way it is done, it is a breach of the principles which underline the federation of the states and the Commonwealth into the Commonwealth of Australia, and it is contrary to the provisions of the constitution itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the states were handing over power to the Commonwealth, they set out in section 51 of the constitution a series of powers which they were handing over. One of the powers which quite clearly remains within the scheme of the states' legislation is that relating to universities and higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look to the fact that universities in this country are established under laws of each of the states and the territories. It is quite clearly an area which was preserved by the states for themselves upon the federation of this nation. Yet here we have, in relation to this particular clause, the Commonwealth breaching that principle and once again undermining the federation as it was brought into existence at the turn of this century. For those reasons in the broader sense and for the particular reasons outlined by opposition speakers in relation to this clause during the second reading debate, we oppose clause 15 and accordingly we shall vote against it. </PARA>

We made a fundamental decision in 1901 to become one country, to become a nation. Implicit in that was the fact that, over time, things would change and that, over time, this government would become more dominant in the lives and affairs of Australians, and that is what has happened. To put up states rights in 1994 and to talk about preserving turn of the century rights really underscores the fact that those opposite have not come very far. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austudy/Abstudy supplement scheme provides voluntary loans to tertiary students. Under the scheme, tertiary students may trade in part or all of their entitlement to Austudy or Abstudy benefits for an interest free loan of twice the amount of benefits traded.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Simplification of the rules relating to the repayment of Austudy or Abstudy benefits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure is simplification of the rules relating to the repayment of benefits. This will make it easier for a student to repay benefits and, therefore, to maximise the amount of his or her supplement loan. If a student who has received Austudy or Abstudy benefits decides to apply for a supplement loan, the student may repay part or all of the benefits received to maximise the amount of the loan. From 1 January 1995 a student will be able to repay benefits at any time during the year. At present, benefits received during the periods from 1 January to 31 May or from 1 July to 30 September must be repaid before the end of the period. This measure is expected to generate savings to outlays on benefits of about $6 million a year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure this evening that I make a few comments in this adjournment debate in support of the motion that was moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) today, which congratulates all the athletes for representing Australia so well in Victoria, Canada, in the Commonwealth Games.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, in particular, this evening I want to pay tribute to two young teenage girls from my electorate of Lyne: namely, Katie Mitchell and Leigh Marning, who have acquitted themselves extremely well in the rhythmic gymnastics section of the Commonwealth Games. I know that they have probably been in the shadow of Kasumi Takahashi, who won five gold medals in that particular section of the Commonwealth Games, but certainly Katie Mitchell and Leigh Marning have done extremely well. They both won a silver medal in the team's event in the rhythmic gymnastics. Leigh Marning also took out the bronze in the individual event behind Kasumi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the departure of the Australian team to Victoria, Canada, for the Commonwealth Games, I had the opportunity to meet with Katie and Leigh at the Australian Institute of Sport here in Canberra where they were in camp for a number of weeks of training prior to their departure. Katie and Leigh took me on a tour of the Australian Institute of Sport and I saw their accommodation and the training facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both girls are aged 15 and have been involved in gymnastics since early 1989 when, under the stewardship and training of Mrs Doreen Rayward in Taree, they began with the Gymaroos, a gymnastic squad based at the Taree Police Citizens Youth Club. They have progressed and travelled overseas. They have both travelled to the Gymnaestrada in Amsterdam as part of the gymnastics display team. They have also been invited to perform at the next world Gymnaestrada in Berlin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these girls have made some major sacrifices. As I said, they come from the Taree area but because of their commitment to their sport they have located themselves in Sydney. They are away from family and go to school down there. I think they live with grandparents and are probably in more difficult circumstances than they would be if they were at home in their local area. They have made that commitment to their sport and they are going through those hardships, which have paid off in the medals they have won not only for themselves but also for Australia. They have done Australia and the local area in Taree quite proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to congratulate in the parliament here tonight both Katie and Leigh for the way they represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada. I congratulate them on the medals they have won and on the way they have conducted themselves as part of the Australian team. I certainly congratulate the entire Australian team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are now going to set themselves for the 1996 Olympics. There has been a lot of talk recently about the commitment and support the Commonwealth must offer its athletes in looking forward to the next Olympics, and certainly the Olympics after that to be held in Sydney. A lot of that support is forthcoming from the Commonwealth but it also behoves me here tonight to note the local community support that was evident at the time when the Taree Police Citizens Youth Club was established, which is where these two girls had their start with the local Gymaroos squad in their training as gymnasts. Now they are reaching to those world standards and the levels within their sport where they can become world leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the local community in Taree for giving these girls their support over the past five years whilst they have been training and gone from rank amateurs to the level they have reached now where they are winning medals at the Commonwealth Games. I look forward to the ticker tape parade that will be afforded our two Commonwealth Games medallists in Taree this Friday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know in the generosity that you have for good football teams, Mr Speaker, you would join with me in congratulating the Canterbury-Bankstown Rugby League Football Club on its excellent effort in securing the minor premiership and club championship last Saturday. As members may know, both the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and I take great pride in being patrons of this club. The club entered the first grade competition in 1935. In all, the Bulldogs, as they are known and loved, have played 12 grand finals, winning half of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first grand final win came in 1938, followed four years later in 1942 by another victory. It was to be some 38 years before the Bulldogs were to win another grand final in 1980, and then in quick succession they won in 1984, 1985 and 1988. They have been runners up in the competition in 1940, 1947, 1967, 1974, 1979 and 1986. In the almost 60 years of first grade competition, the Bulldogs, like their following, have changed in composition but not in character. The fans over the years have grown, but they now come from all sorts of different cultural backgrounds. However, one thing that has not changed is the tenacity and fervour of the fans and the team alike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members may know, the Canterbury-Bankstown area has one of the largest ethnic populations in Australia&mdash;the second highest percentage of people born overseas or with overseas born parents. Despite the Anglo-Celtic beginnings of rugby league, it has thrived in this area where the community has a fond tradition of backing those who aspire and rise to success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many thought that the influx of people of non-English speaking background would mean that rugby league in the Canterbury-Bankstown area would die and that soccer would become a more popular code. But that has not happened, and part of the reason for that is the very big effort Canterbury makes to ensure it meets the needs of the community through coaching and competitions with the schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only by building up that local core of support that the club has been able to continue to be the great club it is. That is why it is with great pride that the community in Canterbury has taken captain Terry Lamb to its heart. As Canterbury wrapped up both the minor premiership and the club championship last Saturday, Terry&mdash;or Baa Baa as he is known to his fervent supporters&mdash;played his 304th match, the highest ever number of first grade matches to be played by an individual. This was no mean feat for a man who, in the context of this sport, is relatively old at 33 years of age. I have to tell you, Mr Speaker, that he has signed up again for another superb season next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one of the greatest days for the club, Terry capped off this historic occasion with two tries to steer the club to a 40-12 victory over Western Suburbs. As you would have seen, Canterbury picked up at half-time the week before and, with some marvellous work by Lamb, the team got its spirit back. Unfortunately for you, Mr Speaker, we had the choice of either losing the game and putting Brisbane out of the top five or defeating the Steelers. I think there was a fair amount of nostalgia that weekend in that Canterbury may have been playing its last game at Belmore Oval. So there was a tenacity to win that was obvious in the second half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terry Lamb has played 304 first grade games for Canterbury and earlier for Wests, scoring 150 tries, 385 goals and totalling a mighty 1,379 points over his career. He represented the city seven times between 1982 and 1990, he represented New South Wales eight times between 1981 and 1989, and he has represented Australia 23 times. Terry Lamb typifies what Canterbury-Bankstown football club is about&mdash;tenacity and hard work. I wish Terry and Canterbury well in the grand final this year. I think those people who predict a grand final between Canterbury and Canberra will be right. I think that will be one of the great games in the history of rugby league, and we will win it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As local members, we attempt to ensure that property owners are properly and adequately compensated. Whether the compensation is for a residential block, rural residential allotment or maybe a farm that can no longer be a viable concern after the compulsory acquisition, it is a very traumatic experience for those affected. This has been my experience with a number of constituents whose homes, acreage or farms or industrial properties lie in the path of the Yandina bypass. They are all resigned to their fate and are now awaiting notification of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One such person contacted me and wanted to know, if he received compensation, whether there are any tax implications. I made some inquiries through the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). I must say that I received every cooperation. An officer from his office sent me draft taxation ruling 94/D35, comprising 53 pages, entitled `Capital gains: treatment of compensation receipts'. Surprise, surprise! On page 33, the ruling reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wally has lived on a 2 hectare property since purchasing it in January 1987 for $300,000. In that time the property has not been used for income producing purposes. One hectare of land is needed by the state government to complete improvements to the highway which runs alongside the property. The relevant State Authority compulsorily acquires the 1 hectare strip from Wally in May 1994 and commences work on the property at that time. The contract is settled in July and the Authority pays $180,000 as compensation for the acquisition of the 1 hectare strip. Wally has engaged the services of an independent qualified valuer who has estimated the value of the 1 hectare strip in 1987 as $120,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The bottom line appears in the subsection dealing with the capital gains tax consequences, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . subsection 160ZZQ(4) operates to impose capital gains tax . . .</PARA>
<PARA>How many honourable members ever thought when they examined the legislation and voted on it that this would be a consequence? I ask the government to object to this ruling, which will become de facto law if the ATO has its way. If this is an example of the intended consequences of the legislation, state and local authorities ought to make sure that compensation packages include an additional payment for possible capital gains tax liability caused by the compulsory acquisition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Labor there are two things certain in life: one is death and the other is tax amendments. Nothing in Labor's arsenal of avaricious taxes assumes Frankenstein-like proportions as its fringe benefits tax. It is the stated intention to extend the application of the FBT far beyond the original justification offered for the impost in the first place. That is giving great concern to practitioners and employers alike. Although not necessarily ever having subscribed to the policy behind the original FBT law, both the professions and businesses had bowed to the inevitable and had come to accept that pure salary packaging benefits were irrevocably caught up in the FBT net.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has clearly stated that this particular tax grab will not be limited to benefits which are clearly substitutions for what would otherwise have been taxable income in the hands of employees. Labor's fringe benefits tax is to be imposed more and more on so-called non-package benefits. Expenses of a business nature are to be caught in a net that never were and never could be, in anyone's wildest imagination, construed as substitutes for salaries to individuals or to entire categories of employees. In other words, the FBT is to tax expenditures that are not proper benefits at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, definitions for the so-called benefits to be brought into the FBT net are simply not available. The chances are, once again, that discretion will be given to the Australian Taxation Office to decide the nature of business expenses to be zapped with the proposed extension of the fringe benefits tax. That is hardly a recipe for certainty. It certainly does not allay legitimate fears that Labor's FBT threatens to suffer from an overdose of overdesign and a total absence of certainty amongst the FBT taxpayers and tax practitioners generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that undoubted confusion now clouds the FBT&mdash;confusion which mocks compliance with and administration of the extended FBT. The principal purpose of the tax was noble enough in its genesis&mdash;that is, to prevent tax avoidance and abuses. It was not, as it has become, to tax business on a broad scale. Let us take the example of business travel. To someone in the desk-bound Australian Taxation Office, domestic or international travel may seem to be something of a perk. Mr Speaker, you and I, and honourable members in this place, know travel is a bit of an ordeal rather than a perk, but you can understand the perspective that people in the ATO might have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who have to endure such travel to further their ability to earn personal or business income that is taxable anyway, it can be something of an irksome ordeal. Even if it is not, who is to say that just because earning a taxable dollar is pleasurable, the cost of it should attract FBT? There is more than a smell of envy about that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor has become almost medieval in its approach to taxation and, particularly in this context, reminiscent of the window taxes and Pitt the Younger. As it stands now, companies might be subjected to FBT for providing chairs and desks. That is the way it looks at the moment. That is the way it is capable of being interpreted. That is the sort of stupid inanity that is thrust upon businesses. That is the sort of uncertainty and fear under which businesses have to labour under this present government's regime and its approach to the FBT, which has gone far beyond what it was ever intended to combat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Speaker. What a glowing tribute to you. Today in the House the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) chose to defend, or should I say painfully defend, the job compact and the training wage. As is his wont, the minister pointed his finger at the opposition and chastised it for having no policy for solving unemployment. Just prior to the minister's defence of the white paper, the Minister for Transport and Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) told us of the great leap forward in the area of enterprise bargaining. He chose not to use the term `non-union agreement' when citing a list of respectable companies which had recently been provided with public money to enter into enterprise agreements. It is almost amusing that a party whose leader constantly evokes the memory of Chifley and the struggles of 1891 and trots out such stirring catchcries as `Labor to the bootstraps' can so blithely accept this kind of equivocation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a euphoric, sentimental moment, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could be forgiven for describing the aforesaid minister as a fink, which, as we all know, means someone who rats on the party. The PM mistakenly used this term in reference to me one day in this chamber. It only goes to show just how cynical the Prime Minister's use of fabricated Labor history is. The PM, of course, rewrites Labor history almost every time he speaks in this House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister after minister will defend a policy by way of the argument `the opposition has no policy'. The truth is, sex and Aboriginal affairs aside, that the opposition has basically the same policies as the ALP. When it comes to the question of sex, the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and his mates&mdash;I presume they are all blokes&mdash;in the Lyons Forum start reciting the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible </EMPHASIS>and blowing their trumpets about Sodom and Gomorrah. If it were not for a few extremists in the coalition ranks, the person in the street would not be able to separate the two parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training: today in the House he actually admonished those who chose not to believe that case management and the training wage were the answer to the problems confronting working people. He did not exactly say that they would solve unemployment; it was more, I think, that they would provide us with a way of handling those who are unemployed, as if they would give us a warm inner glow and show that the government was at least committed to thinking about the problem of unemployment. There would not have been a person in the House who truly believed in it, or was prepared to stake his or her political future on it. But, instead of challenging the logic that it was built on, the coalition chose to construct the myth that the problem of unemployment was due to Joan Kirner's appointment to the chair of ESRA. Why the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) chooses this path absolutely confounds me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth is that on the question of the job compact and training wage the opposition spokesperson for industrial relations, the member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), does not have too many problems with what Minister Crean has given us. No matter how often the minister tries by sleight of hand to convince himself and this House that training wages do not equal cheap wages, others know otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many times is the minister going to tell us that the cheap wage system he is instituting is really a discounted wage for training or that a lack of job readiness is the real problem? It is almost obscene to be arguing that unemployment is a consequence of a lack of skill or that visiting your case manager is akin to a session on the couch with an analyst. The discounted wage aside, a wage the minister admitted proudly had been extended to the adult long-term unemployed, it could very easily end up as a mechanism for depressing wages. That would be depressing, too. In theory, there is nothing in the legislation to guarantee that discounted wages will not threaten award wages or the employment of workers on award wages. Are we to rely on the benevolence of the employers, or are we to rely on the commitment of a government which continues to fall subservient to the market?  As we discovered, this is a dangerous practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of the debate over the privatisation of airports illustrates yet another crisis of philosophy within the ALP. Tonight during the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill debate, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), to his credit, systematically and comprehensively debunked the argument of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in favour of airport privatisation. What is unfortunate about the debate is not that there is actually one occurring but, more importantly, that it is incumbent on the Left, and tonight the member for Melbourne, as every public asset comes up for sale, to mobilise a defence based on the logic of the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents of the logic of the market crow about efficiency, competition and the maximisation of profit as if this is what really happens in the economy. When it comes to media ownership I do not see the member for Werriwa jumping to his feet to attack an inefficient, slothful media monopoly. Nor do I hear him arguing for a more efficient taxation system to fund a diminishing government outlay. What is really needed, as the member for Melbourne alluded to but the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) does not seem to want to talk about, is a new debate about the responsibility of government to redistribute wealth in a manner which displays at least a modicum of commitment to social justice. At the moment it is non-existent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Perth Dental School has a significant number of serious problems. The Perth Dental School is administered by the University of Western Australia. A review was commissioned by the Senate of the university in October 1993 to define the future of the dental school within the University of Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.1<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it reasonable to project that Western Australia need not increase the supply of new dental graduates in order to reach an optimum dentist population ratio of 1:2720 by 2011?</PARA>

<PARA>These are very important questions. They are particularly important to the students and staff who are working within the present confines of the Perth Dental School. I happened to visit the Perth Dental School on 7 July. From my observations, the conditions that the students and staff have to work under are an absolute disgrace. In fact, I would consider the building and its interior to be an embarrassment as Western Australia's dental school. It is our representation of dental education in the state. I understand that there are students who come from South-East Asia with a view to undertaking courses at that school and I would have thought that it would be extremely embarrassing for the staff to have to show them around this particular building. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) All aspects of helicopter operations are regulated under the Civil Aviation Regulations (CARs). Compliance with all Regulations is a pilot responsibility. However, in that part of the airspace which falls within the Sydney Control Zone (which includes part of the area referred to in the question), air traffic controllers monitor compliance with CAR 100 (compliance with air traffic control clearances and instructions).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NSW Commission of Inquiry into the Proposed Heliport for the Central Business District of Sydney at Pier 8, Pyrmont recommended that the NSW Environment Protection Authority confer with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) with a view to investigating the present and future use of R409. The investigation is to include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA is examining the possibility of monitoring noise levels using its Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Details of Restricted Area R409 are contained in the Designated Airspace Handbook and the Sydney Visual Terminal Chart. An extract from the Handbook and a copy of the Chart have been provided separately to the honourable member</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The procedures for operating within R409 are contained in the Enroute Supplement Australia. An extract from the Supplement has been provided separately to the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) CAR 157 prohibits all aircraft from flying over any city, town or populous area, at a height lower than 1,000 feet. There are, however, a number of exceptions to the minimum height rule that are set out in CAR 157 itself (eg taking-off or landing at aerodromes or specified helicopter landing places, search and rescue, law enforcement, emergency etc).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CAR 156 does not permit aircraft to be flown over public gatherings, without the permission of the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Australia is a signatory to the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention) and generally adopts the standards and recommended practices of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under Section 11 of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 the Authority is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with the obligations of Australia under the Chicago Convention relating to the safety of air navigation. The Convention does not impose limitations on the making of Civil Aviation Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ICAO Annex 16 prescribes standards and recommended practices for aircraft noise and engine emissions. The Government has given effect to the noise standards through the Air Navigation (Aircraft Noise) Regulations. The Department of Transport is currently developing regulations to apply the emissions standards in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Yes. CAR 157 broadly conforms with ICAO Annex 6.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 the Authority must endeavour to perform its functions, other than its regulatory functions, in a manner that ensures that as far as is practicable, the environment is protected from the effects of, and the effects associated with, the operation and use of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the Civil Aviation Act provides that the functions of the Authority include carrying out activities to protect the environment from the effects of, and the effects associated with the operation of Commonwealth jurisdiction aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Act also provides that State laws in respect of land use and environmental consequences do not apply to the Authority, property or transactions of the Authority, or acts or things done by or on behalf of the Authority.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) As mentioned in Part 4 (above) CAR 157 itself provides a number of exceptions to the minimum height rule. CAR 157 (3A) provides that the minimum height rule does not apply to a helicopter flying at a designated altitude in a particular access lane (eg access lanes associated with R409). Also CAR 157(4) sets out a number of other exceptions to the minimum height rule and allows the Authority to exempt aircraft from the minimum height rule in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Exemptions are issued by officers of the Authority who hold a delegation under the relevant CAR. In the case of CAR 157(4)(b) exemptions would normally be issued by the relevant District Office of the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) (i) and (ii)&mdash;Exemptions may be issued against any CAR or Civil Aviation Order where that Regulation or Order makes provision for such exemptions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Helicopters operating within the Sydney Control Zone are provided with an air traffic control service and continuous radar monitoring. The dimensions of the Sydney Control Zone are shown in the Sydney Visual Terminal Chart which is referred to in the answer to Part 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outside the Sydney Control Zone, helicopters are not under continuous radar monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monitoring of aircraft within R409 has not been possible due to limitations of the radar system at Sydney Airport, however an upgraded radar system currently undergoing installation may, in conjunction with the CAA's Noise and Flight Path Monitoring System, provide the capability for environmental monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) All civil aircraft flights are governed by the CARs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(18) Yes, the Helicopter Association of Australia (HAA) proposed an alteration to Restricted Area R409 (refer to answer to Part 19).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CAR 157 was amended in 1992 to omit the different minimum height requirements for helicopters and aircraft. Previously the minimum height for helicopters was 1,000 ft and the minimum height for aeroplanes was 1,500 feet. The amendment aligned Australia's requirements more closely to the requirements in other leading aviation countries such as the USA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is not possible to accurately provide the information in the format requested without extensive use of limited manpower resources for manual research of military records. However, during the period May 1951 to November 1959, 227 021 national servicemen served in the Defence Force. Of this number 6 967 served in the Royal Australian Navy, 197 787 served in the Australian Regular Army and 22 267 served in the Royal Australian Air Force. From December 1959 to May 1965 no national servicemen served in the Defence Force. From June 1965 to December 1972, 63 790 national servicemen served in the Australian Regular Army.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)(a) During the period 1965 to 1972, 15 542 national servicemen served in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) With regard to service in Korea and Malaysia, under the provisions of the National Service Act 1951 national servicemen could not be sent overseas unless they signed an undertaking to do so. In the event that such an undertaking was signed by an individual, that conscript's category would be changed to Permanent Military Force. Consequently, no national servicemen served in Korea or Malaysia as a national serviceman. In 1954 some national servicemen were assigned to HMAS Vengeance which was used primarily as a training ship. HMAS Vengeance sailed for Japan on 27 October 1954 and returned on 3 December 1954. Although HMAS Vengeance did not sail within 100 nautical miles of the Korean coast it was deemed to have been allotted for service in the operational area because of the duties it had performed. It is not possible to provide information on other RAN ships that served in Korean or Malaysian waters without physically checking the individual records of all naval personnel employed during the periods in question as well as ships' ledgers which are held by the Australian Archives. This task would involve substantial manpower resources with associated costs, the expenditure of which cannot be justified.</PARA>
