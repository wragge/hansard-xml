<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in presenting the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> The Implications of Australian Defence Exports</EMPHASIS>, and incorporating an additional report by six members of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry by the joint standing committee commenced on 8 September 1993 when the then Minister for Trade, the Hon. Senator Peter Cook, referred this matter to the committee. The terms of reference for the inquiry included such issues as: the definition of what goods and services actually constitute defence exports; guidelines, constraints and conditions governing defence exports; the role of existing programs in facilitating defence exports; the strategic, political, economic, international and human rights implications of defence exports; and Australia's role in the development of an international regime of monitoring and reporting defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was conducted by the trade subcommittee on behalf of the joint standing committee, and I would like to thank all members for their contribution to the inquiry. There were some differences of opinion and this is reflected in part in the additional report submitted by a number of members of the committee. The committee notes in its report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export of defence and related goods from Australia has always been a matter open to controversy and question. Essentially, the debate is over the conflict between the economic benefits of defence exports and the moral and strategic concerns at trade in arms; ways of addressing those concerns; and the value or otherwise of defence self-reliance.</PARA>
<PARA>These same issues came up during the many hours of committee deliberations, but I must say that all members worked long and hard in examining the issues, trying to reach agreement on the areas where this was possible. The fact that there is an additional report, which in large part focuses on the morality of defence exports, is a reflection of this debate and the range of opinion that exists not only within the committee but also within the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding these introductory remarks, I would like to thank the former chair of the trade subcommittee, the Hon. John Kerin, for his work on this inquiry prior to his leaving parliament and to place on record the committee's thanks to the subcommittee staff&mdash;Jane Vincent, Bev Forbes and Annette Fischer&mdash;for the outstanding way in which they assisted the subcommittee in its work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the end of the Cold War, the international security environment has changed significantly. Governments now have the opportunity to concentrate more on trade and domestic issues. There has been a new emphasis on resolving previously intractable international disputes such as in the Middle East and Cambodia. International relations, however, are much more fluid and new kinds of turbulence and disorder are emerging. These include challenges to national sovereignties and the structure of states, the rise of artificially submerged ethnic groups often accompanied by violence, and the assertion of regional powers. Current security problems tend to be more diverse in nature, geographically dispersed, often driven by local hatreds and have little significance beyond their immediate areas. Many of them generate or are accompanied by other problems such as famine, massive human rights abuses and large scale refugee flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with the changing security environment has come a changing market for military goods and services. Major powers in Europe and North America are cutting back defence expenditure and releasing surplus items for sale. Figures show that exports of major conventional weapons have been declining since the late 1980s. On a global scale, there has been an increase in the supply of equipment at the same time as demand is falling, creating a `buyers market'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a relatively small defence exporter, with the total value of Australian exports of defence and related goods in 1992-93 of $36.8 million. Even allowing for some distortion because of the deficiencies in defence export data&mdash;and I will come back to this a little later&mdash;this represents a very minor part of total Australian exports. Defence exports represent less than one per cent of Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures, which in turn represent about 14 per cent of Australia's export of goods. By comparison, the Australian Defence Force imported about $1.5 billion of defence equipment in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the main sources of Australian defence exports have been in munitions, aerospace, electronics and shipbuilding industries. However, even then, there are very few large firms in Australia where exports of defence goods account for a significant share of sales. Defence exports are important for some specialised small firms or for specialised business units within larger firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current defence exports policy stems from 1988 when the government redirected its policy to encourage the export of defence and related goods within a framework of responsible and realistic export controls. The Department of Defence has the major role in coordinating export activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee examined issues such as the operations of the guidelines for export, including industry concerns regarding processing time for export approvals; the role of customs in the verification of the nature of the goods to be exported and whether the goods are indeed exported; the defence export program; the implications of defence exports; and Australia's international role in arms control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, I do not propose to use what time remains to go through in great detail all of the committee's 20 recommendations and numerous conclusions. However, there are three areas that I would like to highlight. The first relates to the collection and collation of defence export data; secondly, the need for all defence export approvals to be automatically referred to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and, finally, the level of government assistance to smaller and medium sized defence export businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite several major reports on defence exports and the defence export process, it is still quite difficult to define what is actually meant by `defence exports'. The term is often used in a very general sense and there is considerable argument about what is, or indeed should be, included under this label. The guidelines relating to defence exports controls, under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations categorise goods in the `defence and related goods' classification as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1.significant military goods, being goods designed or adapted for military purposes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. other military goods including equipment, information and technology; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. non-military lethal goods&mdash;equipment that is inherently lethal, incapacitating or destructive, such as sporting firearms and non-military ammunition and explosives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, other related controls under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations for goods outside these categories, and controls also apply to goods proposed for export to particularly sensitive destinations. For example, there are controls that restrict the export of law enforcement goods, aircraft and aircraft components to Libya, and other regulations that control the export of compounds from which chemical weapons warfare agents can be produced, or the export of nuclear and related goods. These types of goods are not classed as defence exports, and were therefore not considered in detail in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the committee, it was generally acknowledged that the definition of defence goods was fairly narrow. While it appeared to be clear enough for the approval process, the committee felt there was a need to develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. The deficiencies in the current definition are most clearly seen when you attempt to use the definition to estimate the value of defence exports, with distortion of the figures resulting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, defence services are emerging as a defence export, though the committee found that until now they have been largely ignored. Data on services are not adequately captured in the export definition and figures, leading us to suspect that actual exports might be greater than the current official data suggest. The committee believes that the development of an appropriate definition of defence exports should be undertaken cooperatively, with input from all of the major bureaucratic and industry groups involved. Improvements in the definition should lead to improved collection of data on defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I highlight relates to the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in the approval process. At present, the Department of Defence has prime carriage of the approval process, with the Department of Foreign Affairs having an advisory role. The committee acknowledged that the new guidelines for exporters, developed in 1989 and subsequently amended and updated, have improved the process enormously. However, the committee received a number of submissions calling for changes to these guidelines. These changes fell into two categories. One group of submissions advocated the need for more control and the other advocated more relaxed controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agreed that the guidelines should be reviewed periodically and that their operation be the subject of a performance audit by the Auditor-General. The committee did not support relaxing the current controls on defence exports, in particular, the greater use of blanket and forward approvals sought by industry groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In arguments seeking tighter controls over defence exports, the view was put that human rights concerns, and indeed the strategic and political ramifications of certain export approvals, were not being given appropriate acknowledgment or consideration by the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is a member of the standing interdepartmental committee on defence exports, the prime function of which is to advise the minister on sensitive applications. This committee considers only some five per cent of all applications each year. The number of failures of the system to detect sensitive applications and refer them to SIDCDE for closer consideration appears to be small, but where they have occurred they have been significant and politically embarrassing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supports the current arrangements, the committee believes there would be benefit from that department's automatically seeing all applications. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> To achieve this efficiently and effectively, a link between Defence's export control computer system and that of Foreign Affairs would be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say a brief word about the level of assistance to smaller and medium sized defence export businesses. There are a small number of defence specific policies and programs and a much larger range of wider government policies and programs to facilitate defence exports. The main agencies involved are Defence, Austrade, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and various state and territory government industry development agencies. However, questions remain on the extent to which the various programs assist the smaller defence export businesses. The committee believes that the Department of Defence should work with the Department of Industry, Science and Technology and Austrade to facilitate services to small and medium sized defence export businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by thanking all who made submissions to this inquiry or who appeared at public hearings. There was quite a divergence of views expressed, but we appreciate the effort that went into the submissions and we value these contributions. I once again thank my colleagues on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their work in completing the report. I commend this report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to supplement the remarks made by the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy). I regret that the minority report was not brought to my attention before I received the report this morning. I feel quite strongly that there has been, within the nature of this inquiry, perhaps too great an emphasis on the degree to which defence exports by the major powers can be of threat to peace around the world without recognising the beneficial effect that can flow from Australia's own participation in the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. That is really what it is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had I seen the minority report earlier I would have been tempted to add my own minority report, to try to put the positive point of view that if Australia wishes to be a clever country we cannot shelter behind the rhetoric of what is being done by the major defence exporters and believe that by our changing our exporting pattern in any way we are going to really make a major impact on the world trade in arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I share the concerns about the world trade in arms. I am worried about the outcome. I am concerned about the way in which there is a jostling for position between various major countries from the United States to the present Russian republic, China, France and a range of other countries. But let us be realistic. The volume of Australian defence exports is minimal. While there are a number of recommendations here which are really designed to try to make sure we do not breach what we see as the grounds of propriety, I believe we need to recognise that manufacturing is really the engine room of recovery in Australia, that it is through manufacturing and developing our capacity in the manufacturing sector that Australia's role in the world, and certainly in Asia, is going to be enhanced. Unless we can use adeptly and well the concept of elaborately transformed manufactures, which I see as possible within the defence export field, we are not going to be able to take advantage of the opportunities in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without going into the statistics for the chairman, whom I commend for his role in the committee, it is worth noting that the manufacturing sector represents only 15.3 per cent of gross domestic product. In the recovery to date, it has contributed almost double its weight in additional output over the recovery period. But, regrettably, if we look within the general field of manufacturing, we will find that while some eight of the 12 industry sectors have increased employment there has been a fall in employment in the other four. So there is an uneven volatility even in the recent growth in manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me is that Australia could so easily fall behind, particularly in that very small area that is affected by elaborately transformed manufactures. It is in that area that I really want to see greater emphasis placed. My whole attitude towards defence exports is to try to ensure that we identify within Australia's export capacity for defence exports a capacity to enhance Australia's own manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn very briefly to the recommendations. I am concerned about a number of the recommendations, even as they come out. For example, recommendation No. 1 is to `develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports'. As I pointed out during the committee's deliberations, to my mind exporting a water filtration plant can very easily be a defence export. Yet a water filtration plant is fundamental in helping many of the poorer countries to provide the health and hygiene necessary for their people's survival. I am concerned, therefore, that in any comprehensive description, as this recommendation suggests, you are going to  come to a description of only the nasties&mdash;if you can call them that&mdash;and not recognise that defence exports cover a very wide embrace and that they can cover many fields which are there for the enhancement of mankind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we need to remember that in our own defence cooperation program, our defence export program, a great deal of help is given in the humanitarian field. Even when we have had commitments in peacekeeping, the record of Australian service personnel in moving into the humanitarian field has been exemplary and we need to recognise that defence exports often and necessarily embrace humanitarian areas&mdash;certainly they do in terms of natural disaster relief in the Pacific, which relief is another very significant field of Australia's defence aid. Let us not exclude just those so-called good defence exports if we are going to produce a comprehensive description. If we are going to produce a comprehensive description, I would suggest that just about every field of manufacturing could be involved in defence exports. So I have reservations about recommendation No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 6 requires an early performance audit by the Auditor-General. Again, I am highly cynical and sceptical about the advantage or wisdom of this. There are three areas identified as being necessary for an early performance audit. I doubt the benefit of this. I do not really see that you are going to be able to identify the problems that there may well be in trying to ensure adequate scrutiny by the Auditor-General's performance audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, we need to understand that nothing in the evidence before the committee suggested that there had been any malfeasance by anybody involved in the financial sense within defence exports&mdash;although there has been a suggestion in the minority report of a number of areas where there seem to have been problems. It refers to the possible export of strike master trainers to Somalia, which of course did not proceed. Let us realise that, if you can export trainers to a country, you might have a chance to enhance their flying skills. Goodness only knows, with the frequency of aviation disasters in the last little while, anything that can be done to better train pilots and to make sure there are safer aircraft would be to the advantage of the world, rather than their being used peculiarly in some adverse sense by way of a counterinsurgency squadron, as is suggested in the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the nasties they suggest relate to Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human rights abuses on Bougainville: I contest that statement. I do not believe that those Australian defence exports are the reason for those things happening. We need to realise that a lot of other countries in the world export defence aid, or at least have defence exports. It might well be that some parts and nature of the aid that we provide need to be examined, but I do not believe that statement in the minority report that Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human right abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things I feel quite strongly about is that training in the Australian Defence Force identifies the positive nature of recognising human rights in any sort of military operation. One of the reasons that I am very keen on enhancing the role of police within peacekeeping is that I think that defence forces essentially are trained for a different purpose. The objections that the minority committee raised might well lead to the conclusion that we need to have some sort of an international police force. Indeed, if that were attached to the United Nations, it might overcome some of the problems that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) is suggesting should be addressed in some revamp of that organisation which has recently been published. Without going into that minority report, I do not agree with the conclusions it reaches in that particular paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we need to understand a couple of other things about this report and its recommendations. I want to identify two other recommendations. Recommendation 16 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Department of Defence consult with Austrade and DIST to establish what additional export facilitation services and activities it might need to develop to assist smaller and medium sized defence export businesses . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am totally in favour of that. We need to try to identify ways by which smaller companies can participate. To illustrate that argument, one particular firm approached me some months ago. It produces the particular type of cloth used in firefighting and other uniforms that help to protect personnel. I see every reason for us to try to export that sort of material. I understand that it is made and developed here. Assistance in that field would be commendable and would help in manufacturing, help to expand the market and help to make that sort of innovatory product a success. Similarly, recommendation 18 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . establish an appropriate mechanism for coordinating industry input to the defence export facilitation process . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Some committees are referred to in this report. I think it would help if industry were brought in to a greater degree and if it were not run just within these two government departments. I believe the two new committees referred to on pages 46 and 47 of the report, and in conclusion 3.36, would be enhanced if they had private sector involvement. I commend the report to the parliament and suggest that defence exports have a very positive role in enhancing Australia's manufacturing industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the people who have signed the additional report, I rise to make some comments about its recommendations. In the additional report we have not disagreed with or dissented from any of the recommendations in the majority report. We just emphasise some additional points that we believe have not been taken into account in the majority report and that, we believe, should be considered in the consideration of our defence exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four major areas where the people who have signed the additional report&mdash;I am one and the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) is another&mdash;have some concerns about the contents of the majority report. We believe that the majority report is deficient is commenting on four major areas. The first area is the types of goods that are classified as defence exports. I will elaborate on that shortly. The second area is the countries where we are selling those goods, the information that is available about those countries and whether we should be selling some of the goods that we are selling to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and probably most importantly, is the issue of the interaction between our defence exports push and our foreign policy objectives. We believe there are some quite considerable contradictions in government policy between the two, and that is an area of considerable concern. The fourth area of concern is the transparency of the process of defence exports&mdash;how much public information and public involvement there is in the process of deciding which countries we should be exporting to and what types of goods we should be exporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) commented that the volume of defence exports is small and, therefore, we should not be particularly concerned about their interaction. I disagree. I believe that, if we are to emphasise defence exports, it is very important for us to do so on the fundamental basis of adhering to our foreign policy objectives and ensuring that the countries to which we sell those goods will not use them for the suppression of human rights and for the denial of the civil liberties of their peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, although our defence exports may be small, they can still have an impact on the daily lives of many people in our region and in our world. It is for that reason that we have made this additional report which, at 39 pages, is almost half the size of the majority report. It is a substantial document which goes to a substantial range of issues and is worthy of consideration by this parliament and the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment, firstly, on the types of goods classified. The majority report did not discuss or investigate at all the range of goods which should be regulated, or any classification system to differentiate between categories of goods for the purpose of regulation. The report failed to address this important, crucial element of the terms of reference. Several submissions received by the committee explicitly took up this issue, and it was discussed in hearings, yet the report has really not addressed that question at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many goods used by various formal and informal enforcement agencies are not included in defence exports. These include restraining devices such as handcuffs, shackles, glue-guns, et cetera; non-lethal anti-personnel weapons such as lasers, truncheons, teargas, capsicum gas, et cetera; tools for interrogation and torture including pharmaceuticals, sodium pentothal, hallucinogens, hypnotics and drugs involved in memory destruction and brainwashing, et cetera; and surveillance devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to make the point that a lot of these implements are used by these countries to suppress the civil liberties and human rights of their peoples. We are involved in exporting those implements to those countries, and I do not believe that is consistent with our foreign policy objectives. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human rights manual</EMPHASIS> of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 1993 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia accords a high priority to the promotion and protection of human rights in the international sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In taking a leading role in international human rights, the Australian Government is conscious of its moral obligation to reflect in its foreign policy the democratic and individual values of Australian society. This position amounts in effect to translating good citizenship to the international arena.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that the sale of some of the implements that we are selling to countries is consistent with that. One of the big areas with which we have a problem is that there is not enough interaction between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence on what is a defence export and which countries we should be exporting to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support both the report and the additional comments made at the end of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. A group of us felt that the main report had neglected some areas and we wanted to draw attention to those additional areas. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) has done so very eloquently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two speakers from this side of the House in discussing the report have drawn attention to the fact that, fortunately, Australia's defence exports are quite low. This demonstrates that, in a sense, the issue is of only marginal importance. It is symbolic of a centrally important issue: how do we increase human security?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence is often described as security but it is a proxy for a broader issue of security: how to resolve conflict without violence and how to build up economic and social security. The problem is that defence diverts resources from programs that many people would see as being of greater importance in the economic and social sphere into areas which have no direct bearing on total human security, which is mainly to do with economic and social issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who contributed to the additional report said that it is important to concentrate as many of the community's resources as possible into the areas of economic and social activity and to minimise the expenditure on defence, consistent of course with being able to defend ourselves if there were ever a threat to our military security. The problem with defence exports is that they lead us into the position of, in a sense, encouraging other countries to increase their defence expenditure. We would hope that those countries&mdash;often our neighbours&mdash;would reduce their defence expenditure in a way that would enable us to also minimise our defence expenditure whereas, if we became involved in a program of maximising weapons exports, we would tend to be saying to those countries, `We would like you to spend more so that you can afford to buy our weapons.' That is clearly inconsistent with a strategy of minimising military expenditure and therefore minimising the ways in which violence could occur when conflict arises, as it inevitably does in all human relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concern is not to prohibit military exports. If we are going to be self-supporting, then it is quite appropriate that, to some extent, we should allow additional weapons that are manufactured to be exported, but we should downgrade and downplay the emphasis that that export drive receives so that we avoid this conflict over priorities that I have been talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that the process of administering the export of weapons be rigorously scrutinised, and the honourable member for Moreton has described that very well. It is important that we ensure to the maximum extent possible that weapons exported from Australia are not used for suppressing human rights in any way or in civil involvement. They should be used strictly for preventing external conflict. Therefore, the procedures that are already in place need to be enhanced so that at every stage of every contract there is a rigorous assessment of the purposes for which those weapons would be used. In this way, we can do our best to ensure that those weapons are not misused in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been quite a difficult inquiry. Fortunately, it does not involve a major area of Australian exports. Our exports of manufactured goods are growing strongly. In this area they are tending to decline as expenditure on military activity in other countries also declines. It has not been an issue of central importance, but it is responsible for the parliament to examine what is happening in the defence export area and to do our best to keep that under control. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would like to comment on the list of nations which we export to. Currently, there are three lists. There is a list of nations that we ban any exports to. Then there is a list of nations, called sensitive nations, in which each export has to be looked at on its merits before we make a determination. Then there is a third list of nations that we freely export to because we have no concerns about their human rights record, et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the list of sensitive nations is kept secret. There is no opportunity for any public input into that at all and that list of sensitive nations is not able to be used in a diplomatic way to seek to negotiate a better human rights record in that country. In fact, we are one of the few countries that keeps that list secret. The United States and Great Britain publish their sensitive lists and use them as a means of exerting diplomatic pressure on those countries to improve their domestic record on human rights and to ensure that that country does not utilise its defence exports to suppress the human rights of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended in our additional report that the list of nations classified as sensitive should be published. That system should enable public input and the decision making processes will be transparent. Also, where there are dramatic changes in the human rights situation in a country, which we know can happen as a result of a military coup where a former democratic government is overthrown by a military dictatorship, there could be a very quick changeover in the status of that country. We believe that this process will ensure that the defence exports regime involving those countries is a much more publicly supported one and that the most up-to-date information is provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to be involved in any sort of defence exports program, it is absolutely crucial that that program be consistent with our foreign policy objectives. Those objectives should be the advancement of human rights and peace and democracy throughout the world. If we are able, through that process, to sell some defence exports, then all well and good. But our first objective should be the protection and maintenance of human rights in our region and throughout the world. We should not allow those fundamental principles to be subsumed by trying to make a few dollars selling weapons which we know are going to be used against the people of those countries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, I present the report of the committee entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investigating Complaints made against the National Crime Authority</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KF4">Mr CLEELAND</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report is a very short report. It contains a single recommendation, which is that legislation be introduced as soon as is practicable to provide for an office of inspector-general of the National Crime Authority to investigate complaints against the authority and/or its staff. The report is not the result of any recent inquiry by the committee. On the contrary, it arises from a longstanding concern on the part of the committee that there is no suitable channel available for the investigation of individual complaints and grievances either against the authority as a body or against individuals working for it. It might be worth while noting that many of the staff employed by the National Crime Authority are in fact officers of state police forces, federal police forces or other bodies which are not necessarily under federal jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does indeed create major problems when this joint parliamentary committee receives correspondence and complaints from people in the belief that the committee will investigate those complaints. This was true when I was chair of the committee from 1987 to 1990. In 1990 and 1991, at a time when I was out of the parliament, the committee examined the issue as part of a broad evaluation of the National Crime Authority. The outcome of that evaluation was a report tabled in November 1991. Among the recommendations made in that report was a recommendation that an office of inspector-general of the National Crime Authority be set up to deal with complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee saw this as an effective yet economical solution. It was always envisaged that the inspector-general of intelligence and security would take on the role in relation to the National Crime Authority and that his or her staff, suitably augmented, would handle both functions. I am pleased to say, that the government response to that recommendation was favourable, as was the response of the inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority&mdash;a body provided for in the NCA Act and consisting of the Minister for Justice and a minister representing each of the states and territories&mdash;and a bill was introduced in 1992 to implement the committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately for the implementation of the inspector-general recommendation, the bill also dealt with a matter which turned out to be more controversial&mdash;the question of access by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority to sensitive information held by the NCA. It proved impossible to achieve a solution to this question and the government withdrew the bill at the end of 1992. Nothing has been done since to put in place an appropriate means of investigating and resolving complaints by individuals against the authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considers this situation to be totally unacceptable. Hence, it has made the report I have just tabled in order to draw to the attention of the parliament the continuing problem. As the report notes, the committee continues to receive complaints from individuals aggrieved by actions of the authority or those working for it. I should stress that the number of complaints received is small and in no way suggests that there are systematic or continuing problems within the authority. However, the committee takes the view that there is still a need for a proper complaints mechanism, even if the number of complaints is small. The committee itself lacks the time and the resources to investigate the more complex complaints. It is unsatisfactory, both for the complainant and the authority, that complaints cannot be independently investigated and resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known in this House that the National Crime Authority is often the subject of public complaints. Indeed, it is not uncommon for people in public positions in this country, through the media, to make all sorts of allegations about the priority or otherwise of certain actions of the National Crime Authority. It would be most valuable if, in fact, there were a body such as the inspector-general to whom those complaints could be directed. It would resolve many of the issues that some people in public feel about the National Crime Authority. It would also enable the committee to devote more of its time to the proper role of the committee which is to supervise and oversee the general operations of the NCA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words about the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which has just been tabled by the committee's chairman, the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland). The report contains a single recommendation which is that legislation be introduced as soon as practicable to provide for an office of the inspector-general of the National Crime Authority to investigate complaints against the authority or its staff. I fully support this recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time I have allotted I would just like to point out that the changes proposed in the Senate, to which the committee's chairman has referred, were designed to make the accountability system more effective by empowering the PJC to have better access to information that would make its work as the oversight body of the NCA more effective and, therefore, better serving the people who elect us to this House in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as the report and the previous speaker have made clear, this is not a new recommendation; it is a reiteration of a recommendation made in the November 1991 report of the committee. That recommendation has not been implemented, even though it was accepted by the government at the time and it was not opposed by the state and territory ministers who, together with the Minister for Justice, constitute the inter-governmental committee on the National Crime Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been a member of the committee for over four years. During that time the committee has been receiving a small number of complaints from individuals expressing their genuinely held view that the National Crime Authority, or someone working for it, has behaved improperly towards them. As has been mentioned, the committee made clear in its report that presently there is no fully effective way of resolving these complaints. The Ombudsman, for example, has no jurisdiction over the NCA. And while the committee itself can deal with the very simple complaints, it just does not have the resources or the time to be able to devote to the more complex ones. Furthermore, if a complaint refers to an investigation already undertaken by the NCA, it is questionable whether the legislation would permit it. So it puts the committee in a very unfortunate position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is amply demonstrated by the long and expensive saga of the various complaints raised by Mr Mehmed `Mick' Skrijel. The committee secretariat told me that his complaints first came to the committee's attention as long ago as 1985. I regard it as a major indictment of the present system that they are still unresolved. In the intervening years his complaints have been the subject of voluminous correspondence with the authority, the Attorney-General's Department and various ministers. Most have also been the subject of internal investigation by police at the NCA and later of a review of the relevant NCA documents by an independent barrister retained by the NCA.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not make much difference. Often we are accused of being too obsessed with the ephemeral. Many in the community lament the fact that we do not appear to take seriously enough the issues which are really important to the Australian community. I might say that trials of the abortifacient chemical drug RU486 should be matters for serious concern not only in this nation but in any nation in which that particular drug is being proposed to be used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a nation that prides itself on having high standards of accountability, the way in which the drug was imported and its subsequent use on Australian women deserves the strongest condemnation. It is clear to me that the federal government has neglected its duty to Australian women to properly monitor the approval process for the importation of RU486 and the ethical supervision of the test in which it is being used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was forced into action when it became clear that Family Planning Victoria reneged on an agreement to review the consent forms it used in its trials. Her intervention was a gesture designed to recover some of the ground she had lost with the feminist movement, many of whom are outraged at a process that Canberra journalist Margo Kingston described as challenging `the limits of the criminal law'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important question in the end is whether RU486 should be used at all in Australia or anywhere else. As an opponent of abortion, I am concerned that the community has been misled into believing RU486 is a post-coital contraceptive when in reality it is a human pesticide with alarming potential side effects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in the debate my colleague the member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) will explore the issues of ethics and the principle of informed consent in relation to the clinical tests in Australia. These follow on from the highly questionable process which saw the drug enter into Australia in the first place which is equally reprehensible and for which the relevant ministers deserve the strongest censure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the recent temporary suspension of the Family Planning Victoria trials, clinical trials of the experimental chemical abortifacient drug RU486 were carried out in Australia by the Sydney Centre for Reproductive Health and by Monash University Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Family Planning Association of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are part of the effort by the special program of research development and research training in human reproduction which is sponsored by the World Bank, the United Nations population fund, the United Nations development program and the World Health Organisation. WHO is the agency charged with the execution of the program because, as Dr Halfdan Mahler, former director-general of WHO put it, its `perceived neutrality' makes it `a most appropriate instrument to deal with an area as sensitive as that of family planning research'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HRP, as it is known, is influenced by an advisory committee on which the inventor of RU486, Professor Baulieu, had been a member. The distribution of the drug in the Third World is conditional on the authorisation of its use in the developed world. Company contracts with the HRP require this process before permitting distribution at a cost-plus price in the Third World. Australia sends taxpayer funds to this program via AIDAB. Hence the trialling of the drug in Australia is preliminary to its being used in presumably huge proportions in areas where the drug proponents say there are inferior health care resources for the provision of surgical abortions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, they omit to say that the side effects and complications would have horrendous consequences for women in those countries because the RU486 induced complications require high standards of medical care and assistance. And, where the drug fails to induce an abortion, surgical intervention is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How did the drug get to be imported in the first instance? In the first place, RU486 was approved for importation into Australia without ministerial consultation that had been pledged to Senator Harradine by the former Minister for Health, Senator Richardson. RU486 is an abortive agent and is therefore a prohibited import unless exempted by the Department of Human Services and Health, subject to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. However, under examination by Senator Harradine in the Senate estimates committee, it was revealed that the drug was exempted from the ban without Senator Crowley or the Minister for Human Services and Health being consulted. Senator Richardson agreed that the official assurances were breached and said that the government would see whether it could rectify the situation. That was in March. He later resigned and nothing has been done since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the clinical trial notification scheme, in the Senate estimates committee hearing it was also revealed that the so-called rigid process, through which every process for the clinical trial of a drug must pass before any research is allowed, did not operate in the case of RU486. The New South Wales health department stated in a letter on 7 April this year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This procedure is in place to ensure adherence to strict ethical, legal and scientific standards . . . This research cannot proceed unless approval is obtained, after rigorous scrutiny of the legal and the ethical implications of the trial, by the relevant Institutional Ethics Committee and the Therapeutic Goods Administration . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Wright, head of the Drug Evaluation Branch of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of the Department of Human Services and Health, told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not evaluate and . . . TGA has not carried out an assessment to the quality, safety and efficiency of this product in connection with this notification. That is up front.</PARA>
<PARA>When pressed as to whether it was incorrect to say that the TGA had rigorously scrutinised the legal and ethical implications of the trial and approved it, Dr Wright said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The TGA is not required to and it certainly is not required to approve it because the approval is by the Ethics Committee. That is what the notification tells us.</PARA>
<PARA>The next question is: are the tests breaking the criminal law? Prima facie, the tests are being conducted in breach of the criminal law. The trials breach section 83 of the Crimes Act of New South Wales and section 65 of the Crimes Act of Victoria. Thus the Commonwealth, by permitting the importation of the drug, is assisting the commission of the offences arising from these provisions. There has been little to no public discussion of the potential legal liability implications for the Commonwealth and its individual officers. In CES and another v. Super Clinics Australia Pty Ltd and others, Justice Newman found that the plaintiff was not entitled to damages for doctors failing to diagnose her pregnancy because it would have been illegal for her to have an abortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the central features of the use of RU486 is the early termination of pregnancies. Dr Weisberg, one of the doctors who gave evidence in the Super Clinics case, told the court that had the plaintiff's pregnancy been established during a time when it had been safe to terminate it would have been appropriate to do so. However, Justice Newman found that an abortion performed using Dr Weisberg's criteria would be illegal in that the defence of necessity, as provided under the Crimes Act, could not apply when it was too early in the pregnancy for a woman or doctor to form an opinion that the continuance of the pregnancy would cause a serious risk to the life or health of the mother. Yet the TPA has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event that the Secretary becomes aware that to undertake or continue the clinical trial would be contrary to the public interest, he has the authority to direct that use of the drug product(s) for this clinical trial must cease.</PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Harradine pursued this issue in the estimates committee, Mr Roche, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Human Services and Health, agreed that the illegality of the conduct of the trials would constitute as being `contrary to public interest'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also not reasonable to claim that the trials comply with the national health and medical research guidelines. Dr Robert Jansen, an advocate for human embryo experimentation and a former member of the medical research ethics committee of the NHMRC, when commenting on the possibility of trials of abortifacient drugs, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my opinion the NH &amp; MRC's current statement and supplementary notes on human experimentation do not obviously permit such trials.</PARA>
<PARA>Worse still is the way in which the women subjects of the trial have been given less than full information of the short- and long-term risks of the way in which RU486 operates. Dr Lynette Dymble, a prominent feminist medical scientist, called the consent forms for volunteers at the Melbourne trials `an absolute disgrace' and called on the trials to be stopped because women were not being fully informed of the risks they face. Senator Woods told the Senate estimates committee that one of the consent forms being used did not have a full and thorough description of the side effects to a woman who was considering taking a very new, novel drug with fairly significant side effects. I think it is fair to say that this very much underplays the potential side effects. The approval of any drug on that basis by any reputable ethical committee would be very surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me, I want to deal with some of the side effects. There have been documented reports of death, heart attack, respiratory problems, post-abortion bleeding requiring blood transfusion, epileptic fits, aggravation of diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. It is particularly risky for pregnant mothers who are obese. Equally frightening is the prospect of possible damage to the mother's life supply of eggs, which may affect future pregnancies. The French government's medical sales commissioner is reported to have said that the main drawback of RU486 is that it increases the risk of birth defects in babies who survive and all women who take it will be virtually obliged to have another abortion if the pregnancy was not terminated the first time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How on earth can a chemical cocktail like this, described as potentially another thalidomide, with such a wretched record, be allowed to be trialled on Australian women? The trials must be stopped at once. The minister for health, who always seems to have to be dragged kicking and screaming to her real responsibilities, must act to prevent the continued use of Australian women as guinea pigs for this human pesticide. </PARA>

I am sad to see that the motion and the speaker so far&mdash;and, I am sure, the speakers who will follow me in the debate&mdash;deal with it by emphasising the legal and moral issues. Morality is something which individuals decide for themselves. I think the Right to Life inspired motion and those who back it are very keen to impose their morals on other people. It is also worth noting that many drugs that are brought into this country from overseas are trialled under the auspices of the Australian government. We do not see motions moved on those issues. I suspect this is one that is mainly directed at those legal and moral issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look first at the Victorian trials. They were being carried out, and will continue to be carried out, under the clinical trials notification system. This system emphasises the regulation of clinical trials by local ethics committees and they are acting in accordance with the NHMRC guidelines. Under the scheme it is the primary responsibility of each sponsoring institution, through an institutional ethics committee, to review, approve and enforce documents relating to informed consent. That may not be ideal. As we have seen, the ethics committee in this particular case did fall short. But, if you do not like the system, change the system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem in this particular case was that the minister of religion who was on this ethics committee was not a regular attendee. He did not put his full weight behind the work of this committee. He has now left the committee and the Reverend Brian Carey from the Uniting Church has taken his place. The committee is now carrying out the work which it has been charged to do and will be reporting back within the next few weeks. That committee is now doing the job it should have done. It is a question of whether or not it was correct in the first place. I say it is a question of being seen to be correct. The minister has acted quite properly to see that that happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) said that the trials have been highly questionable. The reality is that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has looked at all of these things, and everything&mdash;the importation of the drugs and the carrying out of the trials&mdash;is within the law. No law has been broken in order that these trials should take place. All the legal requirements have been met. As we know, the Right to Life organisation brought a legal challenge recently and that was thrown out of court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other issues that the member has put forward in his motion which he did not speak to was an accusation that the gynaecologists who are working on these trials have been involved in the pituitary hormone program which operated and which we now know has had disastrous effects on a lot of people. The reality is that a high proportion of some of the most prominent Australian gynaecologists and obstetricians were involved in some way in that particular program. That does not eliminate them from working on any other program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going on to elaborate on that if you will permit me. The member has said that these trials contravene laws in New South Wales and Victoria. As I have said, the Right to Life organisation intended to take this to court. It had not even reached that stage before it was thrown out. The Attorney-General's Department has looked at the matter very carefully and the trials have been found not to contravene the laws of either of those states. However, those laws are the responsibility of the states and if the states see just cause they can try to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final part of the member's motion is that this drug should be banned. The only reason I can think of for banning the drug is that it will take away the joy of the Right to Life organisation to picket abortion clinics, because a lot more women will not be going to those clinics to have surgical abortions as they will be able to handle the situation much more easily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members who are speaking on this bill would have received a letter from an organisation called Women Hurt by Abortion. This letter outlines the psychological trauma which is experienced by women who have undertaken abortions. There is absolutely no doubt that there is psychological and physical trauma for women who undergo abortions. There are very few women&mdash;and none that I have ever known of or have known&mdash;who have undertaken an abortion without looking at the situation very carefully and undertaking counselling. If we need to enforce more counselling prior to women making that decision, making that choice, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that when a woman is pregnant her hormones change and the trauma attached to the physical changes which happen after an abortion are significant. Of course, the emotions are also brought into play. That is very important. The letter, in pointing out the emotional trauma from abortion, then goes on to tell us we should ban this drug to save more women going through that trauma. That is the purpose of the letter. The reality is that if women use this drug they will not get to the stage where that trauma is evident. They will not be carrying a foetus for one month, two months or even three months. There will not be the hormonal changes that are effected through the pregnancy. I think the letter defeats its whole purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not want this debate to be one about abortion but the honourable member for Moore has brought it into the argument. The statistics show us that in the last triennium&mdash;I think it was the 1988 triennium&mdash;there were no deaths in this country from abortion. Prior to that, there were 45 a year. Most of those women in desperation went to backstreet people who gave them unsafe and unclinical abortions, and they suffered greatly from it, both physically and psychologically. We have overcome that by the new, safe procedures that are allowed, and anything else that can help women to make educated and informed choices is definitely preferable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, this is a women's health issue and I doubt if many gentlemen on the other side&mdash;I notice none of your women are speaking on this topic&mdash;have sat with women who have gone through some of those backstreet abortions waiting to have a miscarriage which has been induced by several feet of rubber tubing being inserted into the uterus. I suggest you would want to look at safer and more practical ways of doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has also talked about the side effects. He has described them graphically. The information I have from the trials overseas is quite to the contrary. So far one woman has died after taking RU486, and she was a woman who had considerable other problems which contributed to her death. The other side effects are said to be the normal side effects which would come from a miscarriage&mdash;nausea, fatigue and other side effects such as those. We obviously have different sources for our research. I suggest that yours is based on an emotional assessment, which is fairly typical of the Right to Life organisation which has no doubt fed you all this information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thoroughly reject the motion put before the House. As I said at the beginning, this is a women's health issue.

But this is not a feminist issue; it is a women's issue. It is not just feminists who find themselves in that situation; it is ordinary working women who, in the past, have not been able to afford to go to an expensive private clinic, who have sought other remedies and who have died as a result&mdash;or left themselves infertile.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the vacuous comments made by the member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) in her contribution to what is a serious matter for women, not only in Australia but in the world generally. I will first deal with the tone of what she said, which was that somehow this is simply a moral argument and is motivated by those who have some belief in a pro-life cause. If one looks at the debate in this country on this issue over the last year or more, one will see that those who have been at the forefront of the debate have not been those from the pro-life cause but those who might be regarded as being of a feminist characterisation, who believe that this is an outrage and a betrayal of women. That is what I shall deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two principal ethical issues in relation to this matter. The first relates to the lack of consent of the women in the trial. As one who practised in this area and had some degree of experience in drawing up consent forms, I think that if one could design a consent form which was more to provide some advocacy for the course of action that the women were meant to follow, rather than providing them with information about what the consequences might be, one could not come up with a better consent form than the one from the Monash Medical Centre and the Victorian Family Planning Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it says about side effects is that there might be some cramps and bleeding similar to a heavy period and, more rarely, there may be nausea, headache, vomiting, fainting or tiredness. The symptoms, if they occur, are usually due to Misoprostol&mdash;Misoprostol being one of the two components. RU486 alone is unreliable as an abortifacient. It fails when used by itself in at least one-third of cases and, even where it is used with a prostaglandin, there is a five per cent failure rate. That means that one in 20 women have to then go through a surgical abortion to follow up this medical attempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The synthetic prostaglandin, Misoprostol, is one of the most potent chemicals known to the human body. It is administered to the human body of these guinea pig women in doses thousands of times higher than the body is usually accustomed to&mdash;and it persists in the body for many hours. The effect of the RU486 and the prostaglandin is a series of side effects, some of which have been explained by my colleague the member for Moore (Mr Filing). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent paper Dr Lynette Dumble, who is in favour of abortion but says it ought to be carried out in a manner which is safe and which does not betray women in this manner, set out a whole list of side effects and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, RU 486/prostaglandin-induced abortion requires more intense medical supervision than conventional suction curettage or vacuum aspiration because of the potential cardiovascular side-effects from the two chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA>But nowhere on the consent form is there any reference to the potential cardiovascular side effects of these two chemicals. She goes on to list a whole range of other side effects, none of which are set out on the consent form. She also deals with the long-term side effects and says that to this day they are unknown. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One experiment indicated that RU 486 has a destructive effect on the uterine lining that facilitates the development of genital infection.</PARA>
<PARA>She suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this cervical side-effect of RU 486 warranted further investigation. Should RU 486 have a similar effect in women undergoing abortion, it might well increase their risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease which is a known cause of infertility and ectopic pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA>The manufacturer of the drug, Searle, put out a statement, which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Searle is not involved in, and in no way endorses, the study of misoprostol as an abortifacient, either separately or in combination with other medical therapies. In fact, labelling for misoprostol contains prominent warnings and contraindications against use by pregnant women. Searle does not intend to research the use of misoprostol in abortion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Searle's earnest intent that misoprostol not be used for any indication than that which we promote . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So the manufacturer of the drug dissociates itself from this trial. That is one of the major ethical issues. There has been absolutely no informed consent and no outline of the risks which, as the honourable member following me in this debate will know, the High Court in Rogers and Whittacker said ought to be outlined.

None of the speakers in this debate today can give any evidence based on their own knowledge and experience of what this drug is about because they do not know.

Yet we are hearing this afternoon from government speakers, rather than their supporting this motion, that there are not any concerns. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plain fact is that there were concerns. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) recognised those concerns latterly, after a considerable amount of pressure was applied to her.

This contrasts with a mortality rate for women who proceed with pregnancy running in the vicinity of five per 100,000 in this country. What is more, no evidence has been provided from any country where trials of RU486 have been conducted of any side effects other than those associated with miscarriage, despite some of the gory details that members opposite have presented to us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of the questions and issues involved in this motion which has been moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) will not be resolved in a 50-minute debate in this chamber, but it is certainly a matter of legitimate concern to the parliament and to members of the parliament and I do not think that speakers on this side have suggested otherwise. It is a matter for the consideration of this chamber, this parliament and members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, this motion was not a motion about abortion. All of the elements and issues raised in paragraphs 1 to 5, which precede the conclusion which is drawn in paragraph six, referred to some alleged inadequacies and gave the honourable member for Moore the opportunity to make some personal observations about the circumstances in which those clinical tests of RU486 have been undertaken. Those particular issues that he raised in paragraphs 1 to 5 are matters of some contention and some dispute. My understanding is that most of them have been more than adequately dispelled. So, if that is the position, then paragraph 6, in which the honourable member draws his conclusion, simply does not follow. It was not until the honourable member for Moore started to speak to his motion here today that he raised the question of RU486 as an abortifacient. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is okay. But if the honourable member for Moore was concerned that RU486 was being used or was being developed as an abortifacient, he should have said so. If his concern was that RU486 is an abortifacient and for that reason the clinical tests should be discontinued, he should have said so. He did not say so and he did not introduce that concept until he introduced the motion here this afternoon. The motion was not about the ethics, the morality or the personal or social implications of abortion&mdash;until the honourable member for Moore rose to speak to his motion. I know that some other members, including the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Forrest), have indicated their concern about abortion. That is quite legitimate. The point I am making is that it was not originally the element of this particular motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to raise the matter of the accuracy or otherwise of the claims made in paragraphs one to five and, as well, the substance of some subjective concerns raised by the honourable member for Moore in relation to the issues he has drawn attention to. The original motion moved by the honourable member for Moore did not make abortion the issue. It was not my intention to deal with that issue but I take it on board and accept the points that have been made by both sides of the chamber about this question essentially being one of women's health. I am always a little sensitive about intruding a male's attitude into that in terms of public policy formation. I am very sympathetic to the proposition that women are and should be in command of their own bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one of the essential points is that RU486 is an artificial hormone which is simply designed to ensure that progesterone&mdash;the natural hormone which makes it possible for the fertilised egg to implant itself in the wall of the uterus&mdash;is ineffective. So I put the proposition to those people who are concerned about abortion that, if this drug were sufficiently refined, it would make it possible to significantly reduce the incidence of abortion because the pregnancy would not take place. You cannot abort a pregnancy that does not exist. A refinement of that particular drug would ensure that a pregnancy does not occur because the fertilised egg would not be implanted in the wall of the uterus. All of the dangers that people have constantly drawn attention to in relation to surgical and other types of abortion would be obviated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that in the light of this the clinical tests of this particular drug should be brought to an end I think is not particularly suitable, not particularly appropriate. I am sure that those people who have expressed some concern about the nature of this particular drug would have any of their reservations addressed by the development of that drug and its refinement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, recognising that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)one of the causes of high unemployment is a maldistribution of work in a situation in which many people are working too hard while many others cannot find work; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)one of the significant reasons for the maintenance of full employment for much of the post-war period was the gradual reduction in average working hours&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">this House urges the Government to establish immediately a task force representative of employers, unions, community organisations, government and experts to study the issue of the organisation of work and to make recommendations which would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)allow average hours of full-time work to be reduced as productivity improves and which could also contribute to increasing the security of the growing proportion of the labour force employed in casual work; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)consider both national standards relating to the organisation of work and possibilities for increasing individual choice about working time.</PARA>
<PARA>People concerned about unemployment commonly suggest reducing working hours and increasing the amount of part-time work as a means for spreading work around more equitably and opening up more jobs. Among the full-time labour force, the average time spent in paid work has increased during the last decade from about 40 hours a week in the early 1980s to nearly 42 hours a week in 1992. Most of that increase occurred during the recession and was apparently mainly due to smaller numbers of employees working more overtime. Over the same period, from the early 1980s to the 1990s, the proportion of people in paid employment for more than 49 hours per week increased from 14 to 18 per cent, which confirms the sense of overwork about which many people complain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both those statistics suggest that there is scope for reducing the average hours of work and spreading that work around more equitably. Surely there must be some scope for that because so many people complain about overwork, pressure at work, work related stress and lack of leisure. It seems likely that there may be some opportunity for redistribution of work. Whether that is so depends mainly on the preferences of wage earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been several surveys of leisure preferences in Australia and overseas. The Australian Bureau of Statistics found in a 1986 survey that about seven per cent of employees would have liked to work fewer hours for lower pay. However, results vary widely if the question is asked in a different way. When respondents in a survey in Adelaide and Brisbane were asked what they would prefer if over the next four or five years they had the choice of getting increases in real pay or more free time&mdash;that is, shorter hours or longer holidays&mdash;about 35 per cent chose reductions in working time. When those respondents are added to those who already work part time and do not want to increase their hours, nearly half the adult employees in both cities favour giving some kind of time reductions greater priority than money wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The researchers conclude that there is no justification for dismissing projects for redistribution of work as outdated or irrelevant. I repeat the conclusion that about half the adults in Adelaide and Brisbane would prefer some attention to be given to reduction of hours of work. That suggests that there is real scope for redistribution of work in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been similar results to those achieved in Australia from surveys conducted in Europe. Some of the results of very extensive research in Europe show that nine out of 10 full-time respondents worked full time by choice but that one in three hoped or expected to work part time at some stage in the future, a proportion that was significantly higher amongst older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another British survey found that one in three full-time employees&mdash;men and women&mdash;would prefer to work fewer hours each week. Other surveys have shown that part-time workers are happier than those in full-time work and that there is a preference for shorter hours in other countries as well as in Britain. Flexitime was universally welcomed throughout Europe. Many people said that they would like shorter hours but, if they were going to have them, they would prefer to take them as longer holidays rather than a shorter working week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion drawn by the person who has surveyed all that evidence is that, instead of assuming that a single working time pattern is the ideal, policy makers, managers and trade union negotiators all need to keep in mind the wide variety of people's working time preferences and the relationship between those preferences at the different stages of people's lives. Therefore, the evidence suggests, there is at least some scope for reduction of hours as a means of redistributing work. That contribution would be of value and should be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A German economist, Hartmut Seifert, comments that it is incontrovertible that the agreed shortening of the working week has had a positive effect on developments in employment. The outcome depends on how productivity gains have been distributed. In Britain, and in Australia, they have commonly been taken as higher pay rather than reductions in working hours. The conclusion from all the evidence which is relevant to Australia is that we should aim to improve working time  autonomy by increasing the capacity of employees to control their own daily, weekly and annual working time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several large groups that would commonly like to work part-time or for shorter hours. Many mothers, and an increasing number of fathers, would like to have more time with their children, though the strength of this preference varies at different stages of children's growth and depends, in part, on their needs. Both women and men have been increasing the amount of time they spend with their children, and many would like to spend more time with them. Greater flexibility about lifetime working arrangements would enable further increases in the time parents have with their children so as to create a better balance between employment and family life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people want different working patterns at different times of their lives. Young people often want to work for longer hours to save for a car, travel or a house. On the other hand, many older people would like to reduce their weekly hours and gradually phase down towards retirement. Most businesses and public authorities could cope with both changes. An automatic option for employees aged over 50 to opt for part-time work should be introduced swiftly. Many people employed in routine production services and in-person services would like to reduce their hours, even if that involved lower pay, in order to enrich their lives with other personally fulfilling, often voluntary, community, cultural and recreational activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Europe, both in Sweden and Germany, the social democratic parties are setting an aim of reducing the average working week to 30 hours&mdash;a target which they seriously intend to achieve. Australian researchers conclude that a widespread favourable attitude to a future with less work could possibly provide fertile ground for a future interest in moves to reduce work time generally and variably in a regulated way in the interests of solidarity with those being pushed out of the work force. It is worth remembering that the postwar decades of full employment were also a period when average working hours fell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be quite possible for the accord partners to agree that a portion of the return from productivity improvement would be taken as a reduction in standard hours. In fact, the ACTU supported that approach by resolution at its last national congress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If such a program were adopted, if labour productivity grew between 1993-99 by the same amount as it did between 1984-90 and if half that increase were used to reduce hours rather than to increase pay, and if employment were increased to offset that reduction in hours, then employment would increase by about 150,000 over that six-year period. That is a very important addition to employment than would otherwise occur, and that is something we ought to be seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I propose that this House call on the government to appoint a committee of inquiry to study this issue. The committee of inquiry would comprise employers, unions, community representatives and experts who could represent all the important points of view. The change would be possible only if there were general agreement for doing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to draw in all the social partners to ensure that they are all consulted fully about what is involved. If that consultation occurred, it is quite possible that there would be general agreement for a gradual reduction in working hours as productivity improved without loss of pay. That would make a significant addition to increasing employment opportunities for those who are currently unemployed. I, therefore, strongly commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit of a joke, a bit of a giggle, for the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore)&mdash;a member of the political party in government in this country that has overseen the greatest unemployment misery in the history of this great nation, has overseen the greatest fall in living standards in the last half a century, has overseen all of this anguish, agony, misfortune and suffering&mdash;to come into this place and say, `I've got a simple solution for you: let's regulate employment.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has done a pretty good job of re-regulating the employment market with the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1994. He has put back more regulations and given the unions more power and more control over all aspects of employment to the mob which is in partnership with you, in accord with you, on that side of the House to give you the opportunity to do more to regulate the employment market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the member for Fraser not simply convince the Minister for Industrial Relations to go along with Bill Kelty&mdash;they are in partnership&mdash;and write some new rules that say, `We'll have a 30-hour working week'? You just said in your brief contribution that the ACTU was all for reducing working hours, letting people have more leisure time and in particular more holiday time&mdash;I believe you said the surveys showed that. That is desirable. But how on earth are you going to regulate that and keep people's incomes at a level so they can still afford to live?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have also overseen the greatest disbursement of income in the history of this country. There are now more wealthy and more poor and fewer of the middle-class people, fewer of those in middle Australia, able to have single-family, one-parent working incomes because of the economic mess that you have made of this country. And you have the audacity to come in here and say, `Let's create another committee. We will get the unions, which are on top of the list, together with the employers and decide how everybody can have fewer working hours. That will improve the economy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member honestly believes that the people want fewer working hours, then that is available to those people. All we need to do is convince the Minister for Industrial Relations to really deregulate the labour market. Then the people in a workplace&mdash;those who want shorter working hours, according to the member for Fraser&mdash;can go along to management and say, `We would</PARA>
<PARA>like to work less time. As our productivity improves, why don't we talk about reducing our working time and not changing the level of our wages, regardless of what happens to inflation?' If management agrees, then they can strike a deal and do it. But that would be voluntary, without regulation and without solidarity between the union movement and your side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You used that word `solidarity' too, did you not? Many people in Australia today complain about overwork. That is amazing. There are still 850,000 people out there complaining their heads off about not having any work at all. It seems to me that is the important issue that we need to address in this place. It is an issue so serious that someone will have to address it positively in the very near future. With the way the economy is going at the moment, as sure as God made little green apples, we are headed for another boom cycle which will turn into a bust&mdash;and the member for Fraser is the economist&mdash;probably more quickly than any of the government forecasters, any of those from Treasury or the Reserve Bank have been willing to forecast to this point. We will head for another bust. Unemployment will go back up again. You know as well I do that every time over the last three decades this country has gone into a recessionary period, when we come back out we find we have a higher level of long-term unemployment than before we went in&mdash;a higher level of structural long-term unemployment than we had in the previous recessionary and growth cycle. So we are left with that legacy today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give credit to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for making an attempt to address the issue of the long-term unemployed, for trying to give them relevant skills. I am not sure he is going about it in the right way, but I give him credit for trying to address that important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the only thing that will really, ultimately put those people back to work is real jobs. If we could cut the working week down to 30 hours a week, theoretically I suppose we could transpose those hours to make enough jobs for all the long-term unemployed, excepting that they lack the skills, the educational requirements of the work that might therefore be made available. If the people who are in work were so happy about that, they would have been willing to forgo wage rises over the last decade to make sure that their comrades in work were not without work. But no-one has been willing to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions, the trade union movement most of all, are responsible for policies which look after those who are employed, not those who are unemployed. If this government motion is to be taken seriously, then I would have thought that the ACTU and all of the super unions would have been in here agitating day after day for a reduction in working hours with no change in the hourly rates of those wages&mdash;in other words, a reduction in working hours and a reduction in take-home pay&mdash;in order that the 850,000 who are still left out on the unemployed queues are put back to work again. I would have thought the unions would have been agitating for that continually, but I have not heard of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard no proposal from the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) to cut working hours, regulate working hours again, put working hours back into the awards. The awards which are the foundation for this new bargaining system all say that 30 hours is the maximum working week. `Nobody shall work overtime'&mdash;why do we not try that? That sounds like something that might have been tried in Austria in about 1925: regulate working hours, regulate wages, regulate when people can take holidays, and let the state control all of it. Or perhaps the unions&mdash;in accord with the government, of course&mdash;could control it all for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser is an economist. He is not a practical bloke who has lived out there in the real world where people today have to survive on lower real wages and lower real incomes than they were receiving a decade ago. That is the problem. People do desire to maintain their standard of living. Families have to send their kids to school and put clothes on their backs. The kids want to watch television and they want a video. They would like to go on a holiday once in a while. But they cannot do that when the cost of living has increased more than their wages have increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The member for Fraser knows demonstrably that it is his government that has been responsible for the fall in real wages in Australia. If, along with that fall, there had been an increase in leisure time and some ability to afford to enjoy that leisure time&mdash;a magic pudding to provide the income for those people who have forgone those working hours to be able to live better lives and enjoy those holidays&mdash;that would have been a terrific idea. But the regulation idea, the old socialist idea `We will regulate the economy; we will regulate employment; we will tell people how long they will work, how they shall work their lives', just does not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a simple solution to all this. The simple solution is to really deregulate the labour market. Give us real labour market reform and let people make their own choices about what working hours they would like, how hard they would like to work and how productive they can be, in order to enable their firms to pay them a living which is greater than it would be today for the same hours of work. That is the way to get productivity up. That is the way to allow people to have greater leisure time and shorter hours of work if that is what they prefer. But let us not try the old regulation game. It did not work in the past, it does not work today, and it is definitely not going to work in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) will probably go down as the representative in this House who made only one speech in his time here. Unfortunately, he has made the same speech about 300 times. No doubt we will have to put up with him making it again. The quality of his contribution does not improve. He still thinks that the employment market is as simple as the market for used cars, that it has no special features over and above simple markets for basic products. I do not want to spend much time refuting some of the rather asinine comments that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He mentioned the fact that the rate of structural unemployment coming out of the latest recession is significantly higher than the rate of structural unemployment which came out of the previous recession&mdash;quite true. He failed to mention that the degree of flexibility now in the labour market is also significantly higher than it was previously. The labour market is less regulated than it was in 1982-83. Therefore, his basic premise that labour market regulation is, in effect, the sole cause of unemployment in Australia is patently wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of more substantial issues that need to be addressed in this debate. I commend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for raising this matter in the House. We do not so much have a problem of shortage of work in the community. It is a statistical fact that average hours worked per head of population in this country have been steadily and gradually rising for the past 10 or 15 years. The issue really at stake is the distribution of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing a structural change in our economy. Increasingly, the working week is not the traditional 38-hour week&mdash;or whatever the particular regulatory hours have been&mdash;it is 50, 60 and 70 hours a week. This relates to the diminishing proportion of the blue collar jobs in the economy and to major structural change which, we would all have to acknowledge, we do not yet fully understand the implications of. The point is that the issues have got to be addressed. The proposal the honourable member for Fraser has put forward is clearly one very intelligent way of pursuing these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing working hours in the way that the honourable member for La Trobe has been referring to is clearly not a solution. He was caricaturing very severely the arguments that are put up&mdash;to the extent that he actually managed to address them at all&mdash;by people such as the honourable member for Fraser. If we were to simply pass a law saying that the maximum number of working hours would be 30 hours a week, in most instances the end result would be that overtime would increase; it would not lead to new employees being put on. Existing employees working 38 hours per week would end up working 30 hours a week and eight hours in overtime, perhaps plus additional overtime that they are already working. That is not the case in all instances but certainly in many instances. Simply saying that bringing down the number of hours in the working week will solve the problem is clearly not correct. That is not what the honourable member for Fraser is saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to take a much more intelligent look at this issue. For example, I strongly commend the government for taking an initiative on paid maternity leave. We need to pursue it further to give people the option to be out of the work force for parenting purposes for longer than they are often able to be at the moment&mdash;not for five or 10 years, but at least for a year or two&mdash;with decent income support which then opens up other employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also issues such as oncosts that need to be addressed. There are a lot of myths, particularly in business areas, about oncosts. I have been an employer. In my position of union secretary I had to deal with a $2 1/2 million budget and 30-odd staff. We had to do oncost calculations when deciding whether we could put somebody else on. Generally, oncosts accounted for about 16 or 17 per cent on top of the salary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the sorts of things that need to be addressed in considering the future of employment and structures of employment in this country. Getting unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000, which the government's white paper commits us to doing, will be a very difficult task. That will be the lowest level of unemployment we have had in 25 years if we achieve it. It is also worth pointing out that in the 1950s and 1960s we had an artificially low level of unemployment because most women were excluded from the work force by a variety of means&mdash;something that is no longer the case to anywhere near the same extent today&mdash;and because we now have an internationalised economy whereby the pressures on our economy are far greater. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The assertion made by the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) that some people in Australia in 1994 are working too hard and taking jobs from others is amazing. This is based on the premise that the number of jobs is fixed and must be shared around as equitably as possible. What would be the arbitrary limits placed on the entry of women into the work force, the number of migrants in the work force and the effect of new technology on jobs? What is really holding back employment is not hardworking people but the government's policies on payroll tax, centralised wage fixing and unfair dismissal laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Hogan v. Wimmera College of TAFE in 1993, it was held that the termination of employment after the expiry of a fixed-term contract was harsh, unjust and unreasonable. The tribunal held that the employer had the responsibility to remind the employee of the nature of the contract as the expiry date approached and bore the onus of ensuring that the employee was fully aware that the fixed-term contract was not to be renewed. In this case, re-employment was ordered with complete back pay. What a remarkable situation. Many small businesses are now left asking, `If you cannot fire employees under reasonable circumstances, why would you hire them in the first place?' Where will the new jobs come from when that is an example of the sorts of situations that arise from this government's unfair dismissal laws?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the floating of the exchange rate in 1983 by the present government&mdash;for which I commend it&mdash;it was inevitable that there would be a more flexible approach to the price of labour. To compare Australian labour costs with other nations, as the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) has indicated, we need to look at the direct labour cost plus the oncosts. That is the key to our competitiveness with Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the European common market&mdash;and I suggest to the member for Melbourne that oncosts are about 40c in the dollar, not the 17c he was suggesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend the comments of Mr Phil Ruthven of Ibis, who is a very respected commentator on jobs and employment trends. He has been making observations on these matters for the last 20 years and I very much agree with them. He suggests that the price of labour in Australia should not be fixed, that awards are outdated and that like all cartels&mdash;be they in oil, tin or even wool&mdash;they will eventually break down. That is what is actually happening to the price of labour in Australia as awards break down. It is even encouraged by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct labour costs, as I have mentioned before, plus the oncosts&mdash;in the form of work care, payroll tax, superannuation and long service leave&mdash;are a very crippling factor superimposed on employers by governments. They add to the competitive pressure we face internationally with our direct labour costs. There should be greater flexibility and no demarcation. Companies like ALCOA and CRA are leading the way with the introduction of flexible annualised wages and conditions compared with award rates and weekly salaries that bring about demarcations related to award structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be the removal of third parties to working arrangements: the unions and the Industrial Relations Commission. We on this side of the parliament have been advocating this for a number of years. The government has now agreed to the philosophical thrust of this issue, but it is not game to remove the unions or the Industrial Relations Commission from these arrangements. Enterprise agreements between employees and management are the way to go to ensure that further jobs are created. This will result in greater flexibility in the particular industry's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ruthven has said on a number of occasions that new service industries should be aware that jobs will be created. It will not be an arbitrary committee that will create opportunities. There will be new jobs in tourism, information systems and financial and household services, such as lawn mowing, laundry services and so on. This change in jobs, which will take place over the next 20 or 30 years, will provide new jobs&mdash;not another committee or a central direction from a government which is committed to supporting trade unions and centralised wage fixing. </PARA>

She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no analysis of unemployment and employment will be adequate unless it takes account of the rapid changes in the structures of working time and working lifetimes; and no employment debate will be complete if it omits working reorganisation.</PARA>
<PARA>John Moorhouse from the University of South Australia pointed out that, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 20 million hours of overtime are worked in Australia. Since 1978, overtime has increased for males by over 70 per cent and for females by over 100 per cent. Simplistically, 20 million hours is equivalent to a total of 500,000 40-hour a week jobs. It is understood that not all of those hours are paid overtime; nevertheless, serious consideration could lead to the release of perhaps 100,000 to 200,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it appears that that proposition got short shrift from the expert committee on employment opportunities and the National Institute of Labour Studies through Mark Wooden and Professor Judith Sloane. Wooden said that the idea had `simple intuition' and Sloane described it as an `idle notion of work sharing'. This is somewhat strange as Wooden acknowledges that the trend in average hours worked by full-time employees has been moving upward. He states that the proportion of full-time workers working in excess of 40 hours has grown from 30 per cent to over 40 per cent, and that 20 per cent of workers now work more than 49 hours a week. He contends that this may be because of multiple job holdings which now represent 4.3 per cent of the work force. Numerically that is around 150,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wooden also states that 16 1/2 per cent of workers work paid overtime: 3.8 million paid hours worked by full-time employees. If we redistributed that it would amount to almost 100,000 jobs. The truth probably is that the potential number of jobs from the redistribution of overtime could be as low as 100,000 jobs and up to a theoretical maximum of 500,000 jobs. Despite some experts stating that reducing working hours and job sharing is naive simplicity, it is happening in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Bank introduced a job sharing scheme three years ago and now has more than 900 employees in the scheme. Amcor, a fibre packaging company in my electorate, 18 months ago had a work force of 190 people working 12-hour shifts. It has changed to eight-hour shifts&mdash;voluntarily negotiated not regulated&mdash;and has employed another 50 people over 18 months, an increase of over 25 per cent. British Airways has also done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most revolutionary move to reduce working hours has occurred in Germany through an accord between employers and unions. The shorter working week has increased the number of mainly full-time jobs by between 250,000 and 300,000. The Volkswagen accord is worthy of comment. After marathon bargaining sessions at Volkswagen plants in Germany, workers will put in 20 per cent fewer hours but will get only a 10 per cent pay cut. That agreement took effect from 1 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called experts argue that reducing working hours will reduce productivity. That is arrant nonsense. Between 1881 and 1981 the lifetime hours worked by British men fell by nearly half&mdash;from 154,000 hours over 56 years to 88,000 over 48 years. It is lower now. But in that time productivity did not fall; it rose. Job sharing and reducing working hours schemes will not on their own solve the unemployment problem. However, these schemes can make a significant difference and must be analysed and seriously considered in the unemployment debate. Implementing such schemes is not without problems. However, voluntary reductions or negotiated agreements between  employers, unions and workers do work. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This theme has been echoed around Australia as part of the continuing debate on our tragic unemployment problem. Notwithstanding the Labor government's role in Australia's unemployment problem today, this is an issue which now demands a bipartisan approach and a lot of lateral thinking. Writing in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, the noted social commentator Hugh Mackay asked:</PARA>

<PARA>My constituents, Mr Krieg and Mr Forbes, believe we should seriously look at the concept of increased job sharing. This does not necessarily mean two people sharing one job; it could mean 10 people sharing nine jobs. I was fortunate enough to spend some time with Mr Forbes in Port Lincoln last week. When you analyse the amount of government expenditure and the net cost to all of us, you realise that the very worthy aim of full employment is negligible. </PARA>

The Australian government now seems to be doing its best to sabotage the peace talks.

Nevertheless, in relation to some of the residual military establishments that are left there, there needs to be a lot of work done in terms of pollution, in particular at the former Soviet naval base west of Tallin in Estonia, where they are withdrawing the rods from the nuclear reactors at the moment. I only hope that they leave that particular establishment in better condition than the one particular military establishment that you and I and others saw at Klooga, east of Tallin.</PARA></TALK.START>

So rather than the Kennett government reducing debt, Mr Kennett has increased the state debt by $2.5 billion&mdash;and to what purpose?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House expresses its deep regret at the death on Tuesday, 27 September 1994, of the Honourable Sir Nigel Hubert Bowen, AC, KBE, Member of the House of Representatives for the Division of Parramatta from 1964 to 1973, Attorney-General from 1966 to 1969 and in 1971, Minister for Education and Science from 1969 to 1971, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1971 to 1972 and former Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia from 1976 to 1990, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Nigel Hubert Bowen was born on 26 May 1911 at Summerland, British Columbia. He came to Australia as a young boy, was educated at King's School, Parramatta, and studied law at St Paul's College and Sydney University. He was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1936 and later to the Victorian bar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the advent of World War II, he enlisted in the Australian military forces in 1941 before transferring to the 2nd AIF in 1942. He served in the South Pacific region for two years, then transferred to the reserves in 1946 with the rank of captain. Sir Nigel resumed his legal career and took silk in 1953. He spent some time as President of the New South Wales Bar Council and from 1957 to 1960 held the post of Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1963, Sir Nigel stood for and won the seat of Parramatta, which had been vacated by the resignation of Sir Garfield Barwick. In 1966, building on his already distinguished and successful legal career, he was appointed Attorney-General in the Holt ministry. He served in this portfolio in successive ministries until November 1969, making a brief return to the portfolio in 1971. From 1969 to 1971, he was Minister for Education and Science and from 1971 to 1972 he was foreign minister in the McMahon government. His parliamentary record shows that he also led numerous delegations on visits within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel left this House in 1973 to take up appointment as Chief Judge in Equity in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. This was followed by his appointment in 1976 as the first Chief Judge&mdash;later Chief Justice&mdash;of the then newly created Federal Court of Australia. He held this position with distinction until his retirement in 1990. His appointment to set up and head the new Federal Court was a particularly appropriate culmination to Sir Nigel's career, as he had long perceived the need for the establishment of a Commonwealth superior court below the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it was Sir Nigel who as Attorney-General in 1968 first introduced a bill for the establishment of such a court. Although that bill was not proceeded with, it provided much of the foundation for the Federal Court of Australia Act that was eventually passed in 1976. In setting up the Federal Court, Sir Nigel was responsible for much of the procedural innovation for which that court is still highly regarded. He also played a significant part in developing the Federal Court's approach to the Commonwealth's administrative law jurisdiction, an area of the law in which Sir Nigel had a great interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Attorney-General in 1968, Sir Nigel initiated the inquiry undertaken by the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee. That committee's report in 1971 formed the basis for the many remarkable developments in administrative law that took place later in the decade: the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; the setting up of the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and the passage of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A true Australian, it was also Sir Nigel who, with the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968, began the process of making the High Court the final court of appeal in Australia. Sir Nigel will also be remembered for his chairing of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest, which was established in February 1978 and reported in July 1979. The Bowen committee's report was an extremely thorough piece of work reflecting Sir Nigel's sound judgment which over the years has become an authoritative source for dealing with the various ethics and conflict of interest issues which parliamentarians, judicial and statutory office holders and public servants have to address from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel was a hardworking and dedicated man who served the Australian people well in both his legal and political careers. In recognition of his great service to Australia, he received a knighthood in 1976 and in 1988 was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia&mdash;one of Australia's highest awards&mdash;for his services to the law. I know he will be sadly missed by many people in the community, on the coalition side of politics in particular, and, of course, by his family. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Ermyn and family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the coalition parties I wish to join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in recognising Sir Nigel Bowen's lifetime of achievement in the law and politics. Nigel Bowen was a great Australian and a great Liberal. He belonged to a generation which saw serving the community and the country as matters of the highest responsibility and the greatest honour. He was scholarly, modest, courteous and, above all, public spirited&mdash;a man who saw the most worthwhile achievements as those which improved the lives of his fellow citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen first served his country in its period of greatest threat, during the Second World War, when he served with the 2nd AIF from 1942 to 1946. After the war he resumed an outstanding legal career at the Sydney bar. Nigel Bowen was one of the foremost lawyers of his generation. As a teacher, as a practitioner and, eventually, as a judge, his legal skills were forensic and formidable. He was a practising lawyer from 1936 and became a Queen's Counsel in 1953. He was highly regarded by his legal colleagues, as was evident from his presidency of the New South Wales Bar Council from 1959 to 1961 and his vice-presidency of the Law Council of Australia from 1957 to 1960. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was 53 years old before he came into the federal parliament as the member for Parramatta, taking the place of another distinguished lawyer, Sir Garfield Barwick. In doing so, Nigel Bowen gave up a lucrative career and a comfortable lifestyle in the law in favour of the vagaries and uncertainties of a life in politics. He did so because he believed in the idea of serving his community and his country in public office. He did so because he had his own ideas about how government, and the law in particular, could be made to work better in the interests of all Australians. And he did so because he believed that the things which liberalism stands for&mdash;namely, individual freedom, fairness, decency and prosperity&mdash;were things worth fighting for and making personal sacrifices for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear as soon as Nigel Bowen came into the parliament that he was going to make his mark. Within one year of becoming a backbencher he successfully moved 35 amendments to the 1965 income tax bill&mdash;not a bad achievement for a new member. The Prime Minister has already recorded the succession of senior ministries which Nigel Bowen held from 1966 to 1972. To all these portfolios he brought a lively mind, a clear set of values, a preparedness for innovation but a rejection of change for the sake of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Attorney-General he began the great task of reforming federal administrative law and the initiatives he took inspired many others through the 1970s. Also as Attorney-General he moved to make the High Court the final arbiter of all matters of federal jurisdiction, thus ending appeals to the Privy Council in such matters. As foreign minister, Nigel Bowen reaffirmed the policy direction of successive coalition governments in their reorientation towards developments in the Asia-Pacific region and in promoting greater regional dialogue and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The high regard in which Nigel Bowen was held by his parliamentary colleagues was evident from the fact that, following the coalition's 1972 election defeat, he failed to win the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party by just one vote. In 1973 he returned to what most of his colleagues regarded as his first love, the law. He became Chief Judge in Equity in the Supreme Court of New South Wales before becoming the first Chief Judge of the newly created Federal Court of Australia, later becoming its Chief Justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the passing of Sir Nigel Bowen, Australia has lost a person who made an enormous difference to the legal and political life of this country. Australia has lost a lawyer and jurist of the highest calibre and achievement. It has lost a person who served in some of the highest political offices and did so in a way that advanced our national interests significantly. Those of us on this side of the House have lost a Liberal who served both a party and what it stands for with great distinction. He was part of a Liberal generation that gave this country good government and laid the foundations for the opportunities which Australia enjoys today. On behalf of the coalition parties, I extend to Lady Bowen and Sir Nigel's family our sympathy at this time and our deep appreciation for his life of service and achievement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this condolence motion for the Hon. Sir Nigel Bowen AC, KBE. I point out that, in addition to all that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) have said, Sir Nigel volunteered for service in the AIF during World War II. He went on to rise to the rank of captain in the very solid service that he gave his country in that role. In fact, in all areas in which Sir Nigel was involved&mdash;the army, the law or politics&mdash;he was clearly a man of great accomplishment and of great talent, a man who provided a very substantial model to us all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel served the parliament, as others have said, in coalition governments under Harold Holt, Sir John Gorton and Sir William McMahon, culminating in the portfolio of foreign affairs, among others. He was a particularly close confidant of Sir William McMahon as Prime Minister and was widely regarded as a thoroughly professional person, as a politician, as a minister, as a man of the law and as a soldier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel was not a professional politician but someone who had made a great success of his legal practice prior to entering parliament in the seat of Parramatta. No doubt he made sacrifices, including financial sacrifices, to enter the parliament but he did so out of a sense of duty and a strong sense of commitment to Australia and to conservative politics through the Liberal Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that he was not scared to take on a marginal seat, which is a very real challenge, especially for someone with the portfolio of foreign affairs. I will watch with interest to see whether a certain other person coming from the Senate makes it. As foreign minister, when contesting the seat of Parramatta in 1972, Sir Nigel held on to his seat by fewer than 300 votes&mdash;but he held on to it. It is interesting to read through Sir Nigel's various speeches to see the issues he concentrated on back then. It was 1972, in his role as the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, that he signalled the need for Australia to build its links with Asia, which was as clearly the requirement then as it is now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I extend my sympathy to Lady Bowen and her family. I can do no better than to quote the words of two leaders&mdash;one of the Labor Party and one of the Liberal Party&mdash;at the time of Sir Nigel's resignation. Gough Whitlam said at that time:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in making a few remarks about Sir Geoffrey Yeend. I knew him a little and came to know him when I worked as a political adviser to Malcolm Fraser in 1982-83. Sir Geoffrey was the secretary to the Prime Minister's department at that time. I must admit that I thought during that period, and when I saw him from time to time after that in different capacities, that he was a man who always upheld the very best traditions of the Australian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, he was a man who was completely fearless in the advice that he gave. Regardless of the predilections of the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, who sometimes did not like to hear the advice Sir Geoffrey gave, Sir Geoffrey was fearless in providing that advice regardless of the consequences. He was also a man who, as I said earlier, always acted in the best traditions of the Australian Public Service by being objective and impartial in the way he handled his duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a man who also had that rare virtue, one that is seldom spoken of&mdash;wisdom. He was a wise man.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With its implications, that question was simply laced with distortions. I can understand that. Here is one for a start. Take the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> poll of forecasters. Where is Australia in the October averages? Top of the list again. High-low range GDP 3.7 to five for Australia for 1994; for 1995, 3.3 to 5.1&mdash;above every other OECD country. It talks about the averages: 4.5 for 1994 and 3.9 to four for 1995. For consumer prices for 1994 it has 2.1 per cent and for 1995, 3.3 per cent. It has the current account at a deficit of 3.9 per cent of GDP for this year and 4.1 for next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that means is that Australia is growing as fast as or faster than any comparable country. We are seeing a very strong pick-up in employment, a commensurate pick-up in employment, where we have seen just on 340,000 jobs created since the trough of about 15 or 18 months ago. We are seeing employment growth running at around 3 1/2 to four per cent, which has to be beyond, I think, any other OECD experience. I do not know any other country that has employment growing at 3 1/2 to four per cent. Obviously what we are seeing is a pick-up in participation. Were we to have taken directly 3 1/2 or four per cent employment growth off the 11 per cent which obtained a year or so ago, we would have unemployment down to seven per cent today. The fact that it is at 9 1/2 per cent means that there are more people looking for work&mdash;and I think it is a good thing that they are encouraged to come out and find work in the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if we are talking about the same participation rates in the labour market today as we had when the former government left office, we would have unemployment under seven per cent&mdash;in fact, with a six in front of it, I think a low six. Of course the increased participation has come in large measure from women's participation in the work force, which is again a good thing. In fact, on my last visit to Europe, Chairman Delors from the European Commission said that the correlation between GDP growth and employment in Australia and the United States is quite remarkable. We are seeing almost a percentage point one-for-one change there&mdash;three to four per cent on GDP, three to four per cent on employment. The Europeans get about a half or a third of that.</PARA>

This is not sovereign debt of the South American variety. The other 40 per cent comes from either state government authorities or state governments. In many countries, state government authorities are essentially private businesses, and many are becoming private businesses here. So if one actually looks rather at the ownership of these companies&mdash;water authorities and electricity authorities&mdash;and imputes to them private status, the great bulk of the debt is private.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debt service ratio is that proportion of exports which are devoted to servicing Australia's debt. It has dropped from 21 per cent to around 11 per cent. It has halved. That has happened because of a couple of things. In the main, there have been more exports, more earnings. Secondly, there have been lower interest rates and some exchange rate effects. It has fallen massively&mdash;by half. That is one of the key ingredients&mdash;the capacity of the country to service its debt.</PARA></TALK.START>

The government should stop them. Get in there and stop this.'

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1554" SPEAKER="Brereton The Hon L.J." NAMEID="5T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSFORD-SMITH" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS; TRANSPORT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that all members of the House will join with me in extending sympathy to the families of the nine passengers and the officer in command of the Seaview Aero Commander which crashed quite tragically on Sunday, 2 October. Like all accidents, this one will be investigated independently by the Bureau of Aviation Safety Investigation. This is the second regular public transport crash involving loss of life since June last year. It is a very sorry event indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of those crashes involved the Monarch aircraft at Young. The BASI report into that crash revealed systemic failures in the Civil Aviation Authority safety surveillance operations and led to an announcement on 20 July this year of a package of measures aimed at addressing and improving air safety. In all, there were eight measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first measure was the establishment of an aviation safety agency. I can advise the honourable member that separate accounting and financial arrangements in the CAA have already been put in place and that this position has been advertised in Australia and worldwide. We expect that we will be in a position to make an appointment before the end of November to the head of the aviation safety agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter dealt with the report on the Civil Aviation Authority's resources in its own directorate of aviation safety regulation. The honourable member will be interested to know that Mr Roser, the CEO of the CAA, has recommended that 57 additional safety staff be recruited. That recruitment is presently under way and it will extend over the course of the next several months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter was financial triggers for surveillance in the case of companies that were not paying their bills. I am able to report to the honourable member that adverse financial information now triggers additional surveillance and has been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter dealt with the recommendations of Captain Terrell. I am able to inform the honourable member that some 42 of Captain Terrell's recommendations for improved safety have now been implemented. The remainder have been adopted by the CAA. Both in person and in writing to the Chairman of the CAA, I stressed the absolute importance of having full and early implementation of Captain Terrell's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth matter dealt with the funding of aviation safety regulation. In that respect, I can inform the honourable member that cabinet will this week consider my submission that the government fund the public benefit elements of aviation safety regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth matter dealt with Commonwealth indemnification of the Civil Aviation Authority's safety regulation functions. This is to ensure that we do not have the situation, as in the Monarch crash, where there is a suggestion of potential compromise by the CAA as a result of commercial insurance arrangements held by the CAA. I am able to advise the honourable member that a deed of agreement has now been drawn up between the CAA and the Commonwealth which will ensure that this cannot happen in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh matter dealt with mandatory insurance arrangements. I can inform the honourable member that cabinet will this week consider a submission for mandatory insurance as a condition of issue of an air operators certificate. That will make it compulsory for that issue and will involve compulsory insurance with a new limit of $500,000 per passenger replacing the former limit of $180,000 per passenger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eighth and final measure arising from the package announced on 20 July was, of course, the parliamentary inquiry, which is now under way, chaired by our colleague the member for Shortland. I know that he has been inundated with submissions as a result of the advertisements placed over recent weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To supplement these reforms today, I have announced some key personnel changes in the field of aviation safety. The changes have been agreed following a meeting this morning of the Chief Executive of the CAA, the Acting Chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority and me. The principal change will see the deputy head of BASI, Mr John Pike, assume the position of acting head of the Civil Aviation Authority's directorate of aviation safety regulation. The current head, Mr George Macionis, will be transferred to other duties. In addition, the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Transport, Mr John Bowdler, will assume responsibility for coordinating aviation safety measures. These changes will, I believe, add to the reforms already announced and give renewed drive to our push for improved aviation safety.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr BRERETON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the Leader of the National Party, I inform the House that, as a result of surveillance of Seaview Air and its activities late last year and early this year, there were a number of operational deficiencies revealed. Those operational deficiencies are evident in the records of the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;records that I have had the opportunity of studying in part over the course of the last 48 hours, but not before that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the House that, as a result of those deficiencies, the authority wrote to the former chief pilot of Seaview Air, Mr Matthews, detailing the deficiencies. They were all deficiencies that were the responsibility of the chief pilot. I am not shirking any responsibility myself or departmentally, but I think we need to have a sense of perspective as to who is responsible for the day-to-day operational safety of aircraft and companies such as this operating a number of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the letter in January of this year demanding immediate remedial action, I am advised by the department that an annual inspection by the CAA on 7 February reported that the airline's operations were generally satisfactory. On 4 March, the company advised the CAA that a new chief pilot was to be appointed. I am told that the new chief pilot was advised by the Civil Aviation Authority of its concerns. At the end of March, the Civil Aviation Authority's district office in Coffs Harbour reported that the new chief pilot had taken immediate steps to improve the company's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seaview Air formally applied, subsequent to this, to the CAA for a regular public transport air operators certificate. It did so on 28 April 1994. It sought an upgrade from its previous charter operations category. A number of things occurred as a result of that. Firstly, the company was required to satisfy the CAA as to its airworthiness and flying operation regulatory requirements. Part of that process required the company's maintenance control manual, its system of maintenance and its essential equipment listing covering its different aircraft to all be upgraded&mdash;and they were&mdash;to the satisfaction of the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of that process involved the nomination of a maintenance controller, who was a person approved by the Civil Aviation Authority. There was also an intensive review of the flying operations side of Seaview Air. That involved a number of things: firstly, the completion of a check of the training manual of the airline; secondly, an approval process for the check pilot; thirdly, an approval of ports and facilities; next, the completion of the operations manual; then the completion of operational inspections; and, further, a final independent check by the Civil Aviation Authority flying operations inspector from the Brisbane district office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the House and to the honourable member that there has been an intense scrutiny of this airline since the complaints were raised in December and January of this year and since the appointment of the new chief pilot, Captain McIver. I can further advise the House that, prior to the issue of the RPT air operators certificate, the Civil Aviation Authority conducted five ramp checks within a one-month period from 6 June this year on the company's aircraft, including one on the Aero Commander aircraft involved. Again, there is ample evidence from the Civil Aviation Authority of the most intense review and investigation of this company's operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised by the Chief Executive of the Civil Aviation Authority that this process revealed no major deficiencies at all. It was on that basis that the Civil Aviation Authority proceeded to issue an air operators certificate enabling RPT operations to commence from 25 July 1994. It is a matter of record that the first plane operating under those conditions was the one that was lost in such tragic circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to the honourable member and in conclusion, I believe that there has been a clear indication of an improved performance by this airline as a result of intense scrutiny over a period of months now.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to advise the House that first payments under the new home child-care allowance were made on 29 September. There has been a very large number of applications. The number of people receiving the maximum rate of home child-care allowance already exceeds the number receiving the maximum rate of with child dependent spouse rebate and we are still receiving applications at a rate of 20,000 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the community to the fact that if anybody who is eligible to do so gets an application in for home child-care allowance by 3 January, it can be backdated to 29 September. I urge all those who think they may be eligible to receive this payment and are not already receiving it to lodge such an application. From the point of view of the Department of Social Security, this is a major implementation task involving major and substantial systems modifications and, even taking into account the degree of difficulty in implementing this scheme, I think the scheme will be of major benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, at least as many people are now receiving the maximum rate HCCA as received the maximum rate with child DSR. It is paid at a higher rate than the with child DSR, so those people are all unambiguous winners. They add to the other categories of major winners from this new measure, particularly the 55,000 low income families which will benefit up to the tune of $1,500 a year. Under the old DSR arrangement they might not have been eligible for the full value of a tax rebate. There are 120,000 families in which somebody might work for, say, half of the financial year and then withdraw from the labour market. Frequently, those sorts of people would lose all eligibility for DSR because the rebate was assessed on a financial year basis. But with the current fortnightly income test applying to home child-care allowance, those people will be able to get it for the remaining half year. Again, some of those people will benefit up to the tune of $1,500 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very much a progressive piece of social reform that involves a significant net addition to government spending on family assistance to the tune of $230 million&mdash;the government's estimate of the amount by which payments will exceed the cost of the with child dependent spouse rebate. It is all pretty good news. What is the opposition's response to this? As always it tries to drag a dead cat across the path; tries to search, riffle through and construct some examples of some people who might lose. For example, it fastens onto the fact that the definition of `income' under the Social Security Act is different from the definition under the Taxation Act. That is true but, for the great bulk of the people who might potentially lose from that, the maximum they can possibly lose is $4.60 a week. The major issue there is the deductibility of child-care expenses under the tax definition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if you are going to talk about that, you have to factor in the fact that we now have a child-care cash rebate which provides substantial assistance for those caring for children. Many of the examples that get cited, including the one in the press release from Senator Lees the other day, purport to show examples of people who are losing. The individual concerned in that particular case, under the circumstances described, was a significant winner under the new arrangements&mdash;when we factor in the fact that we have a child-care cash rebate in addition to everything else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other examples are constructed which are just patently artificial. Another from Senator Lees's press release involved a situation where the carer had $30,000 worth of shares and was affected by the fact that under the social security income definition accruing capital growth is taken into account. That is true. It is possible to identify some categories of losers but, overwhelmingly, people win from this measure. What is it that the opposition is saying? Is it seriously saying that, in constructing a major reform of the whole system, we try to do it in such a way that there is absolutely no possibility of there being any losers? If you do that, you come up with all manner of absurdities and you end up with intolerable administrative complexities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition would have us operating a social security system with two different definitions of income. It would have us bringing in the home child-care allowance to replace the with-child DSR but keeping the with-child DSR going. The opposition treasury spokesman has the hide to come in here and talk about the need for the government to run a tighter fiscal policy. At the same time, with one piece of legislation after another, the opposition tries to add to the expense of what are already very costly items of social reform in additional assistance for families. It wants to blow it out further. On the one hand the shadow minister for social security says that and, on the other, the shadow treasury spokesman criticises us for not running a tight enough fiscal policy. The inconsistency and hypocrisy is phenomenal and I think the great bulk of the Australian electorate will see through it.</PARA>

In last year's federal election, of women candidates, less than a quarter ran in seats which were safe or marginally safe for their party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bonython for his question. The issue of urban waterways and the question of waste water in urban areas are very important, certainly in the context of South Australia and the Patawalonga, which was mentioned by the honourable member. The Patawalonga is identified by the coastal zone inquiry as the most polluted waterway in Australia. The catchment of the Patawalonga estuary is over 200 square kilometres and flows through 11 council areas. Stormwater and rubbish from all these areas wash down to the lake and are sluiced out across Glenelg beach, which is one of Australia's premier beaches and attracts a large number of tourists as well as people from all over the metropolitan area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue of water quality is clearly a question of conservation of water, it is an issue of pollution and it is an issue of economic importance. It is an issue that has gone on for some time and is now being resolved for the first time in many years. The better cities program has forged cooperation between the South Australian government and 11 local councils as well as with the multifunction polis to work towards the long-term management of the waterway.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MFP, with local government and the state, is developing a pricing and charging mechanism for stormwater management. The development of this management system will mean that the clean-up will be permanent. The system will also initiate a key micro-economic reform in water resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of issues of environmental management, the crucial thing is to achieve cooperation between different levels of government. In this case, the better cities program has achieved cooperation between the Commonwealth, the state and 11 units of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that we understand that the issue being resolved is not only important to South Australia but part of an environmental engineering skill that is of national and international importance. The better cities program in South Australia is involved not only with the Patawalonga and the $15 million worth of expenditure there which will lead to private investment of more than $80 million, but also with the Virginia-Boliviar pipeline, which will mean for the northern suburbs of Adelaide a massive growth&mdash;</PARA>

This will contribute to the revitalisation of that area and the potential growth and further development of the northern region of Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues of water are of crucial importance environmentally, especially at a time of national drought. They are also very important in terms of social equity and social justice, and the western suburbs of Adelaide will benefit as a result of this measure. They are also of very great economic importance. For quite modest investment in infrastructure, we can see economic development occurring at Glenelg and in the other areas that I mentioned, and this is worth many times the initial investment. I commend to the House the better cities program and particularly these examples in South Australia of multi-layered cooperation which will achieve a very important solution to major environmental problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thirdly, in the most recent budget, a sum of almost $9 million was allocated to provide extra resources for the development of literacy skills in the crucial early years of schooling. The early literacy program will support efforts such as reading recovery and first steps, which have proved effective as intervention strategies in the development of literacy in children up to year 3. In this context, I admit to some concern at reports that the Western Australian government has sold the marketing rights to the first steps program to a British company. Under this arrangement, schools will have to pay for more than one copy of the original program, although three or four would be provided in the average school. The taxpayers of Australia have already spent some $5 million developing the first steps program. The taxpayers of Western Australia have already paid their share but now their government is asking them to pay again. They are being asked to pay $160 a copy for access to material which may be vital  to their children's education.</PARA></TALK.START>

This myopic attitude must be a cause of concern, particularly at a time when the federal coalition is proposing a national strategy on literacy for the states. There may be a short-term dollar in it for the WA government, but there are tremendous difficulties down the track for young people who are not being given a fair opportunity to acquire literacy skills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Does Australia's substantial overseas aid effort reflect community expectations and priorities? Does the government have evidence regarding the level of community support for its aid program?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1563" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION & PACIFIC ISLAND AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it happens, we do have evidence&mdash;partly because we conduct surveys into this through Roy Morgan&mdash;that the aid program which the government runs is highly supported within the Australian community. The most recent survey of over 2,000 people shows clearly that over 90 per cent of Australians are aware of our aid program and that more than 70 per cent approve broadly of the way in which it is done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, there is very strong support for assistance to improve health standards and to provide essential infrastructure. There is very strong support for  protecting the environment in developing countries and for general humanitarian programs. There is very high recognition of the role of education and training in combating poverty in developing countries. I point out that education for women and girls was a very strong recommendation of the recent Cairo conference on population and development, which I attended on behalf of the government. There is very high support for family planning programs and for the response to the Rwandan crisis, of which the government is very proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect, which I found a bit surprising given the criticism it gets, is that there is also strong recognition and approval in the community of the fact that the Australian aid program produces real benefits for Australians. We spend 90 per cent of our program on competitive Australian goods and services and supply them as aid. One conclusion that I am not so pleased about is the fact that only three per cent of those surveyed know what AIDAB is. After 20 years of its existence, only three per cent of people know what the government's aid agency is and does, and I am now considering what we need to do about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall I am pleased not only that the community supports foreign aid but also that the government's aid program reflects the very priorities which were identified by those surveyed. The Keating government has a very proud record in the delivery of foreign aid. In the budget before last, there was over a threefold increase in family planning activities, something which all respondents identified as a very high priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More especially, last year the government increased foreign aid by $82 million or 3.6 per cent. It is one of only seven governments in the Western world to have done so. That increase enabled us to introduce several very important initiatives. We targeted health, malaria, tuberculosis, neonatal tetanus and poliomyelitis. We targeted the environment through the green DIFF program and elsewhere. We targeted Indochina, an area of great importance to Australia, in the part of the world in which we live. Overall those were the very areas that were identified by the community as being important to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, these achievements stand in very stark contrast to those of the opposition, whose last public statement on the aid program recommended that the aid budget be slashed by $200 million. It is pretty obvious that the opposition, unlike the Australian community, believes that foreign aid is a thing that does not matter.</PARA>

I do not know whether the Prime Minister had read his briefing notes properly, but I found it very strange to look at the current account deficit as a percentage of GDP, as quoted in this month's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, and find that for 1994 we topped the poll at minus 3.9 per cent&mdash;as is forecast; it will obviously be fairly close to the mark&mdash;and next year it is expected to rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it quite staggering that the Prime Minister said that the opposition should be rejoicing about the economic figures confronting Australia. After all the years of his government, I could not believe the Prime Minister would be proud of the fact that we are still going further into the red. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My topic for the grievance debate today is the effect overall management of the economy is having on interest rates in this country. This government has lost sight of reality. It believes that the only way we will get a recovery is to have a rhetoric led recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at all the words we hear from the Prime Minister&mdash;the usual Labor rhetoric about how things are always going to get better, even though we seem to be going further and further into debt. Just prior to the 1987 stock market crash, we heard the Prime Minister saying, `This is the golden age of economic change.' I suppose there must have been some change for a few people. Some are still reaping the rewards as they find themselves being detained behind bars&mdash;some are even having close links with the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, as we were going into recession, he said, `Labor not only claims a superior economic strategy and performance&mdash;it has proved it.' In the next year we went straight into the worst recession we had had in 60 years. In 1990, as we were actually going into the recession, the Prime Minister was saying, `These are definitely the golden years of change.' I do not know whether he thinks that a rhetoric led recovery is going to have some real effect. I am deeply concerned: not only are interest rates continuing to rise and reaching some of the highest levels in the world, but we even find that the Reserve Bank is sounding increasingly concerned. Its annual report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the budget stimulus initiated in the period of economic weakness has to be wound back to make room for the necessary growth in business investment and to avoid a disproportionate share of adjustment falling on monetary policy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in other words, interest rates. It seems that even the Reserve Bank is trying to warn the government about what its loose budgetary policy is going to do to the future of the recovery that is slowly starting to be evidenced in this country. The Reserve Bank is warning the government that, if it is going to avoid further interest rate rises, it is going to have to reduce its deficit. Yet it seems that the government cannot understand or will not understand or just will not listen, because we are gradually going further and further into the red. Not only do we have the budget deficit, but we have the balance of payments problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite staggering to see what has happened to foreign debt under the Labor government. It seems that the government does not even care. When this government came into power in 1983, Australia's foreign debt was $23 billion. By 1988, that figure had risen to a massive $96 billion. By 1994, it has reached $166 billion. It almost seems to be an exponential increase. There are now estimates around that, if things do not change by the year 2002, our foreign debt could be around $400,000 million&mdash;a staggering figure and, I would suggest, pretty close to an unsustainable figure. This makes us increasingly vulnerable to volatile international financial markets. We are indeed becoming more and more vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government talks about wanting to make the nation more independent; it seems that, when it comes to financial efforts, we are becoming less and less independent. As we become more and more beholden to foreign bankers, more and more beholden to the level of foreign investment, we are obviously reducing our independence; we are starting to mortgage our sovereignty. The really concerning thing is that this situation could send interest rates even higher.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at what the OECD has to say. The government is often very quick to quote from the OECD. The Prime Minister has been quick to claim the credit when the OECD has had something favourable to say. The OECD now says that in 1995 Australia is likely to have the largest current account deficit of industrialised countries. It predicts that in 1995 Australia will have the highest long-term interest rates in the world. This is exactly what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, which the Prime Minister wanted to quote from earlier today, was saying. Not only do we have the highest current account deficit for 1994, but the forecast for 1995 shows that it is rising and that we will still be at the top of the polls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that the Prime Minister is quite happy to talk about some of the figures, but he is overlooking what the complete picture is going to mean. Interest rates are a matter of very real concern. As I said, the OECD has forecast that in 1995 Australia will have the highest long-term rates in the world. Is telling the business sector that interest rates are going to be the highest in the world really the sort of thing that will fuel a long-term recovery?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you look at the same article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS>, you find that right now Australia has the highest prime rate in the world, at 9 1/2 per cent. We do actually share that prize with someone else&mdash;Sweden. It also has a prime rate of 9 1/2 per cent. The government used to like to cite the Swedish model as the example Australia should follow. Recently it has had some reluctance to talk about Sweden, and I think if you look a bit deeper you can probably see why. We also find that some of the other countries we are dealing with have rates that are significantly lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is even more interesting to look at real interest rates and the CPI increase for the past 12 months. Australia's CPI rate is 1.7 per cent. Let us look at a few comparable countries. Britain has a higher CPI, of 2.4 per cent, but if we subtract that from its prime bank rate we find that the figure is significantly lower, nearly one per cent lower, than Australia's.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance this afternoon relates to our failure as a nation to exploit available opportunities for the export of services and to utilise Australian inbound freight services and insurance services for our imports, as well as utilise opportunities for our exports. There is a longstanding culture in this country in both the public and the private sectors of giving preference to foreign shipping, foreign freight forwarding, foreign insurance and foreign services generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes I think it is a hangover from 1788 when this country was settled and shipping was a captive market for the British shipowners, who were later joined by the Scandinavian and European shipowners. In more recent years they have been joined, in respect of iron ore and coal, by Japanese controlled or Japanese owned shipping services generally. It is probable that therein lies the major reason this country has never developed a major international shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a cargo/distance basis&mdash;a tonne/kilometre basis&mdash;we are the fifth largest shipping market in the world. It is an excellent basis upon which to develop our own international shipping industry. But this longstanding culture in Australia of an aversion to Australian services, including international transport services, applies to both imports and exports. It is time that competitive Australian services be given a fair go in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent report released by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and prepared by LEK Partnership Pty Ltd included material drawn from responses by some 1,370 service exporters, interviews of 75 key companies and surveys of some 45 associations. The report is based in the main upon the information drawn from those responses, interviews and surveys. The report shows that there is great potential for growth in the export and use of Australian services. In fact, projections indicate that export revenues from all service exporters will more than double in the five years between 1993 and 1998 and that jobs in the service sector will increase from some 228,000 in 1993 to 337,000 in 1998. But there is also a domestic multiplier effect from that: the direct jobs in the service sector go up by some 109,000 and on top of that revenue from sales will increase from $14.9 billion to $33 billion in the years 1993-98. There is great opportunity there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we can break this longstanding culture, and if we can get Australian importers and exporters to at least consider using competitive Australian services and transport and everything associated with transport, there is a great gain to be made. We can go on to look wider at the question of services generally. What is a service? According to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> magazine, a service is `anything that you can't drop on your foot'. If we look more broadly, page 10 of that report lists some 28 different industries from which information was drawn. I will not quote all of them but the industries represented include: wholesale and distribution; technical services like architecture, consulting engineering and surveying services; services to agriculture; business administration; advertising and marketing; legal services; scientific research;</PARA>
<PARA>education and training; broadcasting and media; cultural, entertainment and recreation; transport and storage; and finance and insurance. I will not read the rest of the list because I want to confine my remarks more specifically to shipping and its related services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shipping is not the only component in the overall cost of the transport service. It is the major cost but linked to that at either end are insurance, freight and all the other services that are necessary to ensure safe transit, good condition and reliable delivery times for the products being carried. Across the world we are seeing the increasing development of integrated transport services. In other words, dealing with one organisation that is responsible for the transport of the freight from a place in one country to a place in another country brings with it efficiencies for the consignor as well as considerable opportunity for those organisations involved in the provision of all of those services. The report deals with transport on page 97, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport systems and infrastructure such as ports and airports are especially important to developing a dynamic and efficient service environment.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian flagged ships carry less than 10% of the nation's international shipping trade&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that would be by value&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">clocking up a $2.8 billion deficit in 1993 because of the use of foreign vessels. In 1993, this figure was equivalent to the total net trade deficit in services.</PARA>
<PARA>Shipping by itself accounted for the total net trade deficit in services. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of shipping reform is complex&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>we all know that; we are dealing with it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it should be given high national priority as it affects Australia's overall trade efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not a report from a transport organisation, from a shipping company trying to push its own barrow or from a maritime union trying to increase opportunities for its members; this is a report on Australia's international services generally from the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. So the organisation making those comments has considerable merit and considerable status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Freight and insurance stand out as the continuing poor performers in services. As I said, our total deficit for 1993 was $2.8 billion. In 1992-93 we had a freight deficit of $2.5 billion, which was shown in the ABS figures released last month, most of which involved shipping. Freight payments to overseas operators rose from $A3.2 billion to $A3.7 billion. Earnings paid to Australian-based operators rose from $1.1 billion to only $1.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditionally Australian shipping has been eschewed by exporters, many of them foreign based. There is a choice between selling abroad on a cost, insurance and freight basis, CIF, where control of the insurance and freight charges are in the hands of the seller, and buying abroad on a free on board basis, FOB, where the buyer arranges freight and insurance. Most of our exports go out on an FOB basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the east coast of Australia the Japanese insist that market forces operate in the determination of coal prices. On the west coast of Australia, where Japan is our major customer for iron ore, the market for competitive Australian marine insurance is closed. That market is reserved by the Japanese for Japanese marine insurance companies. It is a pity that we do not have the same kind of arrangement from this government in support of Australian marine insurers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the concluding minutes I draw the attention of the House to article X of the Basic Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between Australia and Japan which came into force on 21 August 1977. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Contracting Parties, recognising that international shipping activities between the two countries play a significant role in the development of their economic, trade  and commercial relations, and bearing in mind the objectives and principles of international agreements to which both Contracting Parties are parties, shall promote mutual co-operation for the development of shipping between the two countries on a fair and mutually advantageous basis.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that marine and cargo hold insurance associated with the movement of cargoes between Japan and Australia come within the ambit of article X of this treaty. I call on our government to take up this issue and bring to the attention of the Japanese government the provisions of article X of this treaty so that there can be a greater opportunity for competitive Australian insurance companies and shipping services to have access on a fair and mutually advantageous basis to the movement of cargoes between Japan and Australia. Most people I speak to have no knowledge whatsoever of the provisions of this treaty, let alone a knowledge that the treaty exists. We want a fair go for competitive Australian services in our imports and exports, particularly our imports and exports with Japan. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to raise a case where justice has been denied to a businessman for more than 99 months through the connivance and machinations of the Swiss government, in effect, costing him around $A5 million. Mr Karel Rychetsky was born in Czechoslovakia and now lives in my electorate in Western Australia as a naturalised Australian. Mr Rychetsky arrived in this country in October 1988. After fleeing the communists in 1948, Mr Rychetsky obtained an economics degree in Switzerland and then worked in Colombia before settling in Switzerland in 1963.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Switzerland he founded a company called Orbex SA, an export distribution company. He was the manager and partner of that business. He put up 45 per cent of the capital to start Orbex and his partner put up the other 55 per cent, though they both agreed to have equal representation and voting rights in the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rychetsky's partner in Orbex, Mr Vilem Allan, also controlled the company which manufactured the drinks and cubes using a prearranged formula to calculate the retail cost of the product. The formula was called `scheme 1964' and was based on a calculation of the prices of the raw materials and packaging, plus 20 per cent profit. In 1969, Mr Allan took over the account controlling the production of the drink known as Tikisa. He then effectively had a monopoly over the company which provided Orbex with the product for export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Between October 1974 and June 1975 a judicial expert in Switzerland found that Mr Allan had artificially manipulated the prices of the products leaving the factory so that a higher export cost was assessed using `scheme 1964'. This meant that Mr Allan stood to make a windfall profit from the inflated prices of the exported goods since he was a partner in the exporting company itself. Over a two-year period, between 1971 and 1973, the judicial inquiry found that the amount was in excess of 900,000 Swiss francs. On the basis of the judicial expert's report, Mr Rychetsky lodged a claim against Mr Allan for fraud in 1975. This claim was rejected; however, the Swiss government at no time contested the validity of the judicial expert's findings in regard to the overpricing scam which netted Allan 900,000 francs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was at this point that the expected 18 months of arbitration on Mr Rychetsky's claim ballooned out to more than 99 months costing him a great deal of money. The court dragged Mr Rychetsky's case out for this long for a number of reasons. Firstly, the court decided to hear the case in private and not in public. Though Mr Rychetsky's claim was well substantiated&mdash;four detailed judicial reports in his favour were provided by him at cost of over 60,000 Swiss francs&mdash;the court took 99 months to make a decision. This court was composed of three members: two of Switzerland's most senior judges and a friend of Mr Allan's lawyer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the court hearings none of the many documents provided by Mr Rychetsky were examined, none of the parties involved were cross-examined and no witnesses were admitted. In addition, Mr Rychetsky's lawyer was gagged and Mr Allan's lawyer was heard. Even more curious is part of the court's decision, finally reached in April 1978, which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To know if the principles of the scheme have been respected in the facts and, if given the case, the inobservation of these principles an incident on the price to be paid by Vilem Allan to Karel Rychetsky for his participations in ORBEX, are questions which cannot be solved without help of an expert's report . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members should remember that Mr Rychetsky provided four reports. This was what appeared to be the first illicit act by the arbitration court. It called for a new report but permitted only Allan to question the expert and to use false balance sheets to support his view. Following the arbitration court hearing, the former highest judge in France, Mr Jean Cosson, concluded that the arbitrators proceeded in connivance, that an error of the Supreme Court judges Forni and Leu was excluded and that he could not explain the behaviour other than by corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rychetsky then lodged a penal complaint against the authors of the falsified report. The judges Forni and Leu said their task had been only to decide the judicial questions and they would be victims themselves if that report had been false. This suggests that they did not establish the facts and therefore were guilty of a breach of article 4 of the Swiss constitution. Mr Rychetsky brought a penal action against the two judges for this failure, but it was rejected out of hand without any inquiry. He was received by the President of Switzerland, Mr Arnold Koeller, in October 1990 and explained his case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the case was aired in the German magazine <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Der Speigel</EMPHASIS>, Koeller ordered a negotiation of the transaction. In a discussion it was stated that the Swiss government did not want to pursue the matter because the image of Switzerland would suffer if the case went further. It was said that the government was ready to settle Mr Rychetsky's claim and that it would be interpolated by the European Commission on Human Rights in relation to his pending claim of denial of justice and violation of contractual rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Rychetsky petitioned the Swiss government in June 1992 to January 1994 based on the writings of a number of senior Swiss and foreign specialists in law requesting the Swiss parliament to admit damages and re-establish the integrity of the Swiss justice system. That petition is still pending. Mr Rychetsky has corresponded with the Swiss minister for finance and the general secretary of finance concerning the settlement of damages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since he has not been able to get a Swiss lawyer to represent him, he has been using a French lawyer. I would like to read a letter sent on behalf of Mr Rychetsky by Rolf Bossi, who was at the time one of the best known penal lawyers in Germany, to the Supreme Court judges Rolando Forni and Hean-Jacques Leu dated 30 May 1986. Honourable members will have to excuse some of the English&mdash;it is not the best&mdash;as it has been translated from German. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Honour,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As evidenced by the attached power of attorney, we are defending the interests of Mr. Karel Rychetsky who has appointed us to examine your behaviour as an arbitrator in the case of Rychetsky vs. Allan, and if the case arises, to submit our findings for examination by the Swiss penal authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the documents handed over to us, there is indication that Mr. Rychetsky has suffered in the arbitration process in which you acted as Judge, important damages which Mr. Andre Cottier, doctor of Economic Sciences, Professor of Geneva University, has evaluated at Swiss Francs 3,8 mill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The award was based upon an intentional false expert's opinion. The introduction of this expert's report into the procedure can only be explained as an act of connivance between the Arbitral Court and the Experts. You are highly suspect by reason of the following circumstances:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of the arbitral proceedings, already four accounting opinions on the subject of the dispute as ordered by one judge and established by a renowned Swiss fiduciary were at your disposition. In spite of that, you had ordered a new opinion even though a rapid decision in the arbitration process was possible based on the opinions already established. This done, you not only offered the defendant (Allan) the possibility of dragging out the proceedings beyond 99 months, which is a duration without equal, but you also prepared the way for the intentional establishment of a false opinion to the prejudice of our client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By nominating the expert and by putting the opinion into the proceedings, you have participated in the penal act of the expert according to Article 307 of the Penal Code. As we have already stated, it was not necessary to order a new opinion. During the proceedings, you had refused the plaintiff all possibilities of control which could have led to a verification of the opinion. The witnesses were questioned only by the Expert, the plaintiff had no possibility of questioning the persons to whom Mr. Jaquier had access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is equally incomprehensible that you had accepted, without critic, the false opinion into the arbitral verdict. At that time there were four opinions of the expert Michet from the years 1974 and 1975. These differed, in a most important way, from the Jaquier opinion which prejudiced our client. This should have lead you to proceed with an investigation of the Jaquier opinion if you had not, from the beginning, the intention of basing your judgment on the false opinion. But the contrary happened. The expert was given the competence of a Judge because he could question the witnesses without control and the part of the other party to the process and in this manner you had prevented all control of the expert by our client.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intentionally that you have contributed to the penal act. Taking into consideration your formation as a Jurist and your experience as a Judge, one has to exclude the possibility that you had overlooked the fraudulent maneuverings of Allan and the intentional establishment of a false opinion. Already in the autumn of 1978 you had in your hands the legal opinion of Professor Stefan Trechsel, Member of the European Commission of Human Rights, which analysed in depth the serious offences committed by the defendant, Allan, offences which are to be attacked by law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the summer of 1983 you had received a copy of the complain of our client against Jaquier and Pollicino for intentional establishment of a false report according to Article 307 of the Swiss Penal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As cited in the opinion of Professor Andre Cottier, the errors contained in the Jaquier opinion appeared so clearly that any first semester student of Economics could see that the Jaquier opinion was false. You had as well at your disposition the Michet opinions which differed in an important way from the opinion under attack and which should have lead you to examine critically its contents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suffice to say, you are highly suspect of having participated not only in violation of Article 307 of the Swiss Penal Code but equally in fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on for some duration. But the federal judges Forni and Leu refused to renounce their immunity, and Mr Bossi held a news conference in Zurich on 30 June 1986 repeating publicly his serious charges against these two judges, leading Swiss newspapers to publish them the next day. However, the Swiss authorities did not undertake to investigate these heavy accusations and, for that matter, the two judges did nothing against Mr Bossi, knowing that these facts were true. It is my opinion that the injustice to my constituent Mr Rychestsky spans 20 years, and it is time the Swiss government stopped equivocating and admitted that there has been a gross miscarriage of justice and settled with Mr Rychestsky after all this time. </PARA>

It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But still in 1938, a time when travel was a much more exclusive thing than it has now become, a band of these workers had refused to load pig-iron onto a ship called the Dalfram on the Port Kembla wharves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Japan had invaded China a year earlier. Nanking had been subjected to the most brutal and ruthless massacres. While none of these workers could speak a word of Chinese they understood what was happening over there. They could see the clouds of war gathering over Europe. They wanted no part of the Japanese war machine. They refused to load the raw materials of war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Melbourne wharfies refused to load the Atsuta Maru. Wharfies in Fremantle, Port Adelaide, Hobart, Sydney and Brisbane had refused to load cargos for Japan but been beaten by legal sanctions and threats of violence.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Attorney-General Bob Menzies tried to force the Port Kembla wharfies to succumb. They were threatened with gaol and fines. There were threatened with losing their livelihood. Menzies provocatively swept through the Illawarra coastal districts to bring the threats home to the men. Crewmen of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dalfram </EMPHASIS>supported the ban. Their leader was declared insane and dumped in a madhouse only to be soon released. They sent in the bankers and rent collectors to throw people out of their home. Strikers were bashed in the streets by police. BHP locked up the Port Kembla works, throwing thousands out of work just before Christmas. The wives and families took up the cry of no war materiel for Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Port Kembla wharfies only gave way when they had brought an end to any further supply of pig-iron to Japan.</PARA>
<PARA>The person who instigated all this was none other than Bob Menzies. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Truth</EMPHASIS> of 31 August 1940 states, under the subheading `Millionaires on Dais of Leadership':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has grown impatient with the procession of major blunders which have characterised Menzies' captaincy since the war began. These blunders, and the shiftlessness of which they are symptomatic, have irritated and distressed the people beyond measure. Nothing less than a sweeping change will satisfy the people on September 21.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, Curtin was put into power at that time. Those articles make interesting reading because they show a little bit of the history of the Liberal Party. If you want a copy of it, I can supply it to you. Also, the Liberal Party policy called the Liberal Platform, the official platform of the Liberal Party of Australia issued by the federal secretariat in November 1948&mdash;it does not issue those sorts of documents anymore because it does not have policies&mdash;states under the heading of `social security':</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Generous provisions by means of an effective social insurance scheme, for superannuation, incapacity, sick pay, medical and the like expenses, unemployment, widowhood, and family endowment. All children to be provided for by child endowment.</PARA>
<PARA>That was quite reasonable. That was the sort of policy the Liberal Party had at its formation in 1948. However, if you remember the 1949 elections&mdash;which I do not because I was only a few years old, but I have read enough about them&mdash;Menzies got into power at that time because he said he would remove petrol rationing and increase child endowment and there would be a huge increase to pensions and the like. He did that when he got into power in 1949. He did remove petrol rationing. The pensioners got a huge rise, but that was the only rise they got for year after year. One of the other things that was removed at the time was called the social services contribution. A Liberal Party ad that was going around on 3 December 1949 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing SOCIAL SERVICES to be maintained, the Means Test modified, and CHILD ENDOWMENT extended to the first child without affecting the basic wage.</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting bit is `Existing social services to be maintained'. What happened when the Liberal Party got into power in 1949? I have here an actual tax return from one of my constituents who has been kind enough to supply it to me. His taxable wage at the time was #389 6s. </PARA>

That money added up over the years to around #30 million, I believe&mdash;a huge amount of money. What did Menzies do? He put it all into consolidated revenue. It all disappeared and went into this huge amorphous mass of money, so the money of those people like my constituent, who contributed more in social services contribution than in tax, disappeared.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the actual summary of the way Chifley set up the social services fund in 1946, from 1 January, we find that it was a specific and separate levy which operated to finance the fund. In 1950, the special levy was merged with general income tax; financing of the fund passed to payroll tax&mdash;an amount equal to the updated 1950-51 levy contribution. In 1976, the then Treasurer, Mr Lynch, had accumulated the balance paid into the consolidated revenue fund. This was all done under the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I doubt that I am any different from any other member of this chamber when it comes to naming the source of most complaints from constituents about any government department or agency. The Child Support Agency, CSA, always but always wins hands down. The deficiencies in the management, administrative procedures and operations of the CSA not only have been a source of constant criticism by its disillusioned clients&mdash;in some instances `victims' would probably be a better word&mdash;and their parliamentary representatives but also have been criticised by many others, including the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Australian National Audit Office and the Joint Standing Committee on Certain Family Law Issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been obvious for a long time that the CSA has never managed adequately to come to grips with the important job that has been entrusted to it. Unfortunately, the government has been responsible for prolonging the agony by its apathetic attitude and torpid approach to introducing the necessary measures to effectively overcome the plethora of problems&mdash;major and minor&mdash;which have beset the CSA since it was established in June 1988. Although there have been some improvements to the operations of the CSA over recent months, the changes came far too late for one of my constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disgraceful episode that I bring to the attention of the House this afternoon has, thankfully, now been resolved&mdash;although it is arguable whether or not the resolution has been satisfactory in all respects. It serves to illustrate, however, the powerlessness of innocent people against an unsympathetic and incompetent bureaucracy and the effort required to obtain justice even when the bureaucracy is finally forced to admit that it has been wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unhappy chronicle of events concerned one of my constituents whose treatment by the CSA can only be described as abominable. My constituent and his wife were married in 1983. Their first child was born in 1986. They separated in May 1989 and at that time reached an informal agreement that, pending final settlement and in lieu of formal maintenance, my constituent would continue to meet their home mortgage payments of $175 per week. My constituent directed his employer to deduct this amount directly from his salary and pay it directly to his wife. This informal agreement was confirmed by a court order made in September 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shortly after, a second child was born. In accordance with section 21 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, both children were `eligible children' under stage 2 of the child support scheme. In November 1989 my constituent, his wife and their legal advisers attended a conference at the Family Court and all matters relating to their separation including child support were resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable the wife to remain in the family home, it was agreed that my constituent would make a lump sum payment of child maintenance and reduced weekly child support payments. Both parties consented to this arrangement and an application to register this agreement was sent to the Dandenong Child Support Agency. The agency admits that it mislaid this application. Apparently a further application was forwarded to the CSA in February 1990, together with written advice confirming that the husband had been making regular payments direct to the wife, that there were no arrears in child support payments and that payments would commence through the agency at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems that this second application was also mislaid by the CSA, so a further copy of the agreement was provided to it. My constituent, quite understandably, hoped that the old principle of third time lucky would apply and that the matter would be resolved. Unfortunately, his confidence was subsequently proved&mdash;along with the first two applications&mdash;to have been misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some two years after the first application had been provided to the CSA, my constituent was shocked and dismayed to find that his income tax refund had been withheld as payment of arrears in child support. He visited Dandenong CSA and, during an interview with an agency officer, was informed that the CSA had been receiving payments in accordance with the agreement. But the agency was claiming arrears of more than $6,000, which it alleged was owing under a retrospective administrative agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency officer advised my constituent to contact a solicitor and make an immediate departure application in the Family Court from the administrative assessment of child support. My constituent followed this advice. However, because of his financial situation at the time, he applied to the Legal Aid Commission for assistance. Although his application for legal aid was ultimately refused, his solicitors filed a departure order on his behalf and the matter was subsequently heard in the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent and his wife appeared at the hearing, both represented by barristers. There was no appearance on behalf of the CSA, despite the fact that it had been served with a copy of the departure application and that it was on the basis of its claim for arrears that the matter had proceeded to the court in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After lengthy negotiations between the legal representatives of my constituent and his wife, complicated by the conflicting and confusing information from the CSA, consent orders were finally made. On the day of the court hearing, my constituent's barrister spoke several times with a representative of the CSA by telephone and advised the officer of the terms of the consent orders which, amongst other things, specified that there were no arrears. She was assured by this officer that all penalties, fines and costs sought by the CSA would be cancelled and that my constituent's income tax refund cheque would be sent to him upon receipt of the orders. A sealed copy of the orders was duly sent to the Dandenong CSA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of costs for my constituent was not pursued at the hearing because, in the absence of the CSA, this would have resulted in extending the hearing for a further day. Counsel representing my constituent was concerned that this extension would involve him in considerable additional costs with no guarantee that they could be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By this stage my constituent had incurred costs of more than $2,000, of which he had managed to pay a $350 deposit. In February 1992 my constituent approached me complaining about the inefficiencies of the CSA and about the financial loss and personal distress he had suffered, and was still suffering, as a result of its actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the then Treasurer informing him of the complaints and seeking his advice and intervention. Three months later, advice was received from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer that the matter was being thoroughly examined by the Dandenong CSA, and it was noted that several matters required further investigation. Two further letters were subsequently forwarded by me to the parliamentary secretary in regard to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, in August 1993 the Assistant Treasurer wrote that, after reviewing the file, the registrar conceded that this matter had not been handled in a satisfactory manner and that my constituent may be entitled to seek compensation. After advising my constituent of this latest development, I understand that he wrote to the CSA making a claim for compensation. Apparently, in the best tradition of the CSA, this letter was also mislaid. In the absence of any response from the CSA, my constituent again approached my office for assistance. Understandably, as over 2 1/2 years had now elapsed, my constituent's solicitors were pressing him for payment of the balance of his account which he had not been able to meet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May of this year I wrote to the deputy child support registrar at Box Hill, making a claim on behalf of my constituent. The claim included his legal costs, estimated loss of wages, travelling expenses and damages for distress and inconvenience. Following a considerable number of telephone calls from my office to the CSA, and after waiting three months, during which time advice was received that the matter had been referred to the Attorney-General's office to determine whether the CSA had been negligent, a letter was ultimately received by my constituent from the CSA. Enclosed with the letter was a cheque to cover the amount of my constituent's legal expenses only. Despite the admission that there had been `a series of errors by the Child Support Agency' and that there was `a breach of duty of care by the Child Support Agency', the letter advised him that if he wanted to pursue any further claim he must provide further evidence of actual financial loss or damage and that the loss or damage was caused by the agency's actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole shameful and disturbing episode has understandably caused my constituent enormous distress and has sorely tested the patience and tolerance of his solicitors. It is shameful and unforgivable that it took something in the order of 2 1/2 years for the CSA to right, and then only in part, the wrong it had perpetrated on my constituent. The fact is that my constituent has been financially disadvantaged as a result of the maladministration of the CSA in this matter. He is still out of pocket in respect of legitimate expenses incurred in defending himself against the CSA's false accusation, expenses which will be very difficult to substantiate, given the stringent requirements of the CSA and the length of time that has now elapsed. The unnecessary and unjustifiable trauma and stress my constituent has suffered is immeasurable and has not been acknowledged by the CSA. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk today about the issue of social justice and social policy generally and the importance for this country of developing even further its social policies as we move towards the end of this century and the beginning of the new one. In this regard the ALP National Conference made some extremely important decisions with respect to social justice and other social policies. It was unfortunate that the media chose to ignore most of these important policy decisions for the dubious reason that they were all agreed by the party; there was no controversy. So the media thought it was boring. But in a range of areas&mdash;I mention the social justice platform, the employment platform and the social security platform&mdash;there were significant and important new commitments, and there were important new developments in social policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social policy issues will be the key set of issues that determines politics moving into the 21st century. The minister and I recently returned from the United Nations Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, where central issues of social policy, especially the rights of women, were debated. Significantly in the context of the discussion of these issues, matters came up such as the importance of universal health policies, the importance of rights for women and for indigenous people and the importance of universal education. `Universal' means, of course, the inclusion of women in this area. So there was a whole range of social policy debates and discussions. The United Nations declaration on human rights was challenged. Did it meet that challenge? It did, and there will be a further report on this matter later this week by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to social policy and social justice policy there has been a lot of discussion in this country and the adoption of a number of approaches. The adoption of the platform has meant that the Australian Labor Party is now committed to a series of policies with respect to, first of all, the acknowledgment of the universal social rights to employment, education, health and housing. Secondly, there was a commitment to set a range of benchmarks for achievements by governments, state and federal, with respect to those social policies and to achieve those benchmarks. Thirdly, there was a  recognition that having those policies was not sufficient unless there is a genuine access and equity policy, that is, a policy which ensures that people have access to those services irrespective of religion, race, gender or ethnic background. That is another key element of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a reinforcement of what I have referred to as the fourth element of social justice, the direct provision of assistance to the most disadvantaged in our community, young kids who are in trouble, homeless people, single parents who do not have enough means of support, et cetera&mdash;those groups in the community who need direct assistance, a helping hand, so to speak. We must not ignore them in the total picture of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this current development within the Australian Labor Party important? It is important because it is part of an international development. There has been an attempt, especially by social democratic parties, to redefine the agenda. Following the collapse of the eastern European societies there has been an attempt to move to the radical right in politics. Many people have tried to emulate the Reagans and the Thatchers of this world. Unfortunately, those experiments have proved a disaster from a social policy point of view. The societies that have followed those prescriptions have ended up with huge gaps between the rich and the poor, with the creation of an underclass and with many other social disasters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been, therefore, serious discussion about how there can be a genuinely social democratic approach that on the one hand gives a real place for the free market and on the other hand recognises the importance of social policies. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the British Labour Party and its new leader have adopted an approach very similar to the approach adopted by the ALP National Conference and by the government in its social policies. That approach gives due recognition to the role of the free market, to the role of the marketplace, but at the same time gives due recognition to the importance of social policies, policies on employment, health, education and a whole range of areas. This development throughout a range of social democratic countries is important when looked at in the context of what has been done in Australia by the Australian Labor government. A large number of the policies that have been developed are similar in their approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is a tradition arising in which the Australian Labor Party is leading the way in many respects, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said recently. When the Prime Minister did me the honour of launching my book on social justice he said that, in many ways, Australia is leading the way in developing this new social democratic philosophy. I bring this point up because so much has been written in the last few months about the conservative party in this country, especially the fact that the Liberal Party is facing its 50-year anniversary. It is a tragedy that there is currently such division in policy direction, that there is no coherent philosophy to replace the kind of benign welfarism of Menzies and, instead, there are those who want to follow the Thatcher model. The recent revelations concerning the philosophical underpinnings of the beliefs of the shadow minister for health, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), indicated the extreme extent to which opposition members are prepared to do that. It was revealed that much of the honourable member's maiden speech was actually from this extreme Right source.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That represents one dimension of the Liberal Party, but there is also the other dimension&mdash;those people who actually want to do something about social policy and welfare. They have not been sufficiently listened to in the context of the Australian debate. It is time that they were listened to. It is time that there was an attempt by the conservative parties&mdash;especially by the Liberal Party, which has to show leadership in this matter&mdash;to accept the fact that in Australia, as indeed in any other civilised society, there has to be certain basic criteria of social justice and that those criteria have to be adopted and incorporated into a coherent position. That has not been happening. When Alexander Downer became the Leader of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address the House on an issue of interest to most, if not all, honourable members, and that is aerial fighting of bushfires. Again, in recent days, we have seen bushfires rage out of control in parts of New South Wales and Queensland. This again prompts a re-examination of our firefighting techniques.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After seeing the disastrous New South Wales bushfires encroach into the Sydney outer urban area earlier this year, we need to examine very seriously the development of an aerial bush fighting capacity in Australia. I am glad to say that there is a very extensive aerial firefighting capacity in Victoria and South Australia. It has been developed over some 25 years and includes a number of large agricultural fixed wing aircraft which are placed near sites which are subject to outbreaks of bushfires. In recent years, they have been relatively successful in quelling fires before they get to the point where aerial fighting and ground fighting has little or no impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A measure of the infrastructure built up by the Victorian government is the involvement of its Department of Conservation and Natural Resources in the New South Wales bushfires of January this year. I understand that, from 5 January to 16 January, 50 conservation and natural resources staff and 14 contract pilots&mdash;plus engineering and other support staff&mdash;were directly involved in air operations. They filled such roles as air operations manager, air attack supervisor, aircraft officer, airbase manager and airbase staff, and were positioned at most major centres of activity around Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirteen conservation and natural resource aircraft flew a total of 424 hours. The aircraft involved were: three medium helicopters for firebombing and evacuation; three light helicopters for command, mapping and air attack supervision; six fixed wing firebombers; and one fixed wing aircraft equipped with infra-red line scanning, which was the mapping aircraft. The conservation and natural resource firebombing aircraft used 3,500 litres of foam concentrate and 32 tonnes of fire retardant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of great concern that New South Wales is so ill-equipped in regard to its aerial firefighting capacity and is therefore left unprepared to cope in a proper way with its bushfire seasons. I make that point because it does establish the importance and value of an aerial capacity in fighting bushfires&mdash;a lesson yet I have to say to be fully learnt by the New South Wales and Queensland governments. Moreover, this form of firefighting capacity is very cost effective. Richard Alder of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources wrote a paper for a conference of the Institute of Fire Engineers in Adelaide in December 1990. In his paper entitled, `Fighting bushfires from the air', he set out the cost effectiveness of aerial firefighting. When the department conducted an analysis of the quelling of fires at an early stage over a number of years&mdash;the last five, for example&mdash;it was able to identify fires in which the actual use of air attack has clearly prevented losses in terms of suppression costs and damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1994, the Australian Fire Authorities Council, which represents all Australian urban, rural and land management fire agencies, compiled a position paper on firebombing in Australia. It concluded that agricultural fixed wing aircraft, and light to medium sized helicopters with a suspended bucket or belly tank, can provide a cost-effective suppression option for fires burning in remote or mountainous country while these fires remain small. We do have, therefore, an established framework which can be copied by states other than Victoria and South Australia to enhance their firefighting capacity. However, it does concern me that we seem to be rushing headlong into adopting larger aircraft. This was very much the recommendation of the then Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure&mdash;now the Senate Economics Legislation Committee&mdash;in its recently released report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Disaster management</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That committee recommended that CL215 water bombing aircraft be trialled in Australia this summer. There has now been a rash of newspaper reports, both in national and regional newspapers, accepting as a fait accompli that the CL215s will be trialled in Australia over this summer. That concerns me enormously because I have serious questions as to, firstly, the cost effectiveness of these very expensive aircraft and, secondly, their technical capacity&mdash;whether or not they can actually do the job we require of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National Jet Systems, which I understand is based in South Australia, has offered Australian authorities a $2.5 million deal to trial these Canadair CL215 SuperScoopers this bushfire season. I am led to understand that this $2.5 million is providing two aircraft and 250 hours worth of flying. That is very expensive when you compare some of the possible alternatives, such as the Catalina from southern California, which I understand would be available in Australia for some $500,000 each, including the transport and purchase of those aircraft. I am not saying that Catalinas are the answer, but I do not believe in embracing the Canadair CL215s until they have been properly assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity provided by a developing industry in my electorate to utilise the former Royal Australian Navy Grumman Tracker aircraft has also not been properly considered. Converted Grumman Trackers are operated throughout the world in a fire control role: by Connair in Canada, Direction de la Securite Civile in France and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shadowstone Aviation, based at the West Sale Aerodrome in Gippsland, has obtained an option to purchase four ex-Royal Australian Navy Grumman Tracker aircraft, which are now hangared at their base at West Sale whilst a detailed analysis and costing on the project is carried out. The indications at this time are that Shadowstone Aviation could convert these aircraft to fire control configuration for approximately $1.2 million each. Conversion time would be in the vicinity of 12 months per aircraft depending on funding availability and perceived urgency. That can be compared with the cost of trialling two Canadair CL215s for $2.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of expertise available to Shadowstone Aviation. Its partner organisation, Yungur Aviation, was responsible for refurbishing to flying standard and then ferrying to West Sale 10 of these former Royal Australian Navy Grumman Trackers. In addition, members of Shadowstone Aviation have had personal experience with both aircraft through the National Safety Council arrangements with the Connair and Canada exchange programs for the fire control aircraft out of season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the cost. Moreover, the Canadair CL215s need to fly in and scoop up the water. I worry about whether or not that is possible. We are told that they require a certain distance to do that. There has to be a body of water, although it may be that they are able to do that in the ocean so long as the fires are not too far away from the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I caution the House about accepting the recommendations of the Senate standing committee without further investigation, particularly in regard to the possible alternative of the Grumman Tracker aircraft. I do not say definitively, nor does Shadowstone Aviation, that the Grumman Trackers are the answer, but we do know that on a cost and practical basis they seem to have a number of advantages over the CL215s. Of course, water would be pumped into the Grumman Trackers whereas the CL215s would need to scoop up the water. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to pay tribute to a Western Australian state parliamentary colleague, the member for Kalgoorlie in the state parliament, Mr Ian Taylor. Members would be aware that, until today, Mr Taylor was the leader of the Western Australian state opposition and he announced his resignation from that position yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Taylor has been a friend and colleague of mine for almost 20 years. I first met Mr Taylor in 1976 when he was a member of the Dianella branch of the Australian Labor Party and a delegate and subsequently an office bearer of the Perth Electorate Council of the Australian Labor Party, which is the relevant party unit responsible for giving organisational support to the federal member for Perth. We subsequently worked on a campaign for Mr Keith Wilson to become the state member for Dianella. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take the opportunity of paying tribute to Mr Taylor because in very many respects he is not the usual stereotype of a politician. I will draw attention to a number of attributes he has, but one point I make about Mr Taylor is that in the 20 years I have known him he has not changed. Public office has not deformed him by usage, which is a complaint often made about politicians by members of the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ian Taylor is a good and decent man. He is honest, a man of great integrity, and he has always been publicly spirited. He has two, I think, very great characteristics. To my knowledge and experience he has always put his family first and he has always put the community, the state and his own party before his own self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became the state member for Kalgoorlie in 1981 at a by-election. In 1986 he became the state minister for health and in 1990 he became Deputy Premier to Premier Carmen Lawrence, now the member for Fremantle in this House and Minister for Health and Human Services. In 1994 he became leader of the Western Australian opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On three occasions he has put his own view of the community, the state and the party good ahead of his own personal position or his personal advancement. On the occasion of the now member for Fremantle's becoming Premier, he chose to become Deputy Premier rather than contest the position of premier because he believed that she would be a better Premier for the state's future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he became Leader of the Opposition in 1994 he was, in effect, against his better judgment, drafted by his colleagues, and his resignation in the last 24 hours has been his own decision on the basis of his view of his own capacities. One of the hardest things to do in this profession is have a cold-blooded view about one's own capacities and a view about what is best for institutions, community, state or country, rather than what is best for oneself. I do not normally rely upon editorials from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>, but I think today's editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> gets it right. It states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No matter how unsuited politicians are for positions of status, they usually need to be prised from them. Mr Taylor . . . went with honour.</PARA>
<PARA>The editorial draws a conclusion with which I agree. It states:</PARA>

<PARA>I believe that is right. Ian Taylor has made a significant contribution to the community of Western Australia, to his state and to his party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). I join with those members in expressing deep regret on the death of Sir Nigel Bowen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was born, quite literally, in a log cabin in 1911 in British Columbia in Canada. At the time, his Welsh born father, Otway, and English mother, Dorothy, were trying to make a go of cherry orcharding after a previous stint in South Africa in the diamond industry. Apparently the particular land in question was subsequently resumed for the purposes of building a railway and the Bowens moved from Canada to Australia. They then set up the family home on a sheep property near Gunnedah shortly after Nigel's birth. Their luck on the land, however, was not terribly much better than it was in Canada and eventually the family moved to Ashfield in Sydney where Otway Bowen returned to his original profession, accountancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These were not easy times, even for accountants it would seem. Nigel apparently needed the help of some relatives to spend some two years of his schooling in England. He then completed his schooling at King's School in Parramatta. He then moved on to tertiary studies at Sydney University where he completed his law degree. He practised initially as a solicitor and then joined the New South Wales bar in 1936. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Second World War he served, as we heard earlier, in a number of roles with distinction and obtained the rank of captain. It was remarked during a eulogy delivered by Bob Ellicott at the funeral that during some work in Papua New Guinea he shared his unit with Captain Frank Packer and Corporal Ninian Stephen. This was quite an amazing collection of outstanding Australians to be one very small unit of the armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the war, Sir Nigel returned to the bar and shared a floor of Denman Chambers in Sydney with such other well-known Australians as Gough Whitlam, John Kerr and, somewhat later, Bob Ellicott. In 1953 he was appointed a Queen's Counsel in New South Wales and in Victoria one year later. His reputation quickly grew, particularly in the areas of equity and constitutional law. He had an extensive appellate practice before the New South Wales Supreme Court, the High Court and the Privy Council. He served as Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia for three years from 1957 and as President of the New South Wales Bar Council for two years from 1959. For many years, from 1946 to 1961, he was the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS>. Hence, he made a major contribution with that august journal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel's interest in politics first stemmed from his involvement with the bar and in representing the legal profession. In 1964 he entered parliament, winning the seat of Parramatta and following in the footsteps of some very distinguished lawyers, including Sir Howard Beale and Sir Garfield Barwick. Within two years, he became Attorney-General. As we heard earlier, he served in that office on two separate occasions. He had a fine record in all of these portfolios, but it is the portfolio of Attorney-General about which I would like to comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, Sir Nigel was a leading Australian silk in constitutional matters. One of his most notable achievements was to see that the appropriate role of the High Court of Australia was as the supreme law making body of common law in this country and the final arbiter in all constitutional matters. He then successfully proposed legislation which saw a range of appeals cut from the High Court to the Privy Council. The final leg of that chapter, of course, occurred with the passing of the Australia Act in 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the defeat of the coalition government in 1972, Sir Nigel contested leadership of the Liberal Party and was unsuccessful by one vote. As Bob Ellicott said at the funeral,  `How different the history of this country may have been if he had won.' In 1973 Sir Nigel resigned his seat in parliament to accept the appointment as Chief Judge in Equity of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. He held that position until taking up appointment as Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was his lifelong friend, Bob Ellicott, who had served with him earlier as Solicitor-General, and then as Attorney-General, who convinced Sir Nigel to take the position at the Federal Court. Bob Ellicott recalled that at first Sir Nigel was somewhat reluctant. It was only after he had been shown the splendid view from the 21st floor of the court building in Sydney that Sir Nigel finally agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during his period as Chief Justice of the Federal Court that Sir Nigel probably made his finest contribution of many to Australian life. Obviously, it was a difficult period. It was a new court, a major development in the Australian legal system, a court which had been mooted for many years&mdash;Sir Nigel himself played a role as Attorney-General in laying the groundwork for its establishment&mdash;and a court which struck some sensitivities amongst state systems, judiciaries and governments. The fact that the court is now so well respected and held in such regard is in no small measure a result of the work that Sir Nigel Bowen performed as chief justice of that court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Federal Court is rightly considered to be one of the premier legal bodies of this nation. Its reputation, both in Australia and internationally, is very strong. Again, that flows largely from the work that Sir Nigel performed as chief justice. It is with regret that we mark his passing. However, we remember the outstanding work that he has performed for this country. Our deepest sympathies go to Lady Bowen and the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I first thank the Speaker for giving me the opportunity to represent this House at the state funeral for Sir Nigel Bowen on Saturday. I was certainly most distressed to learn of his death. Sir Nigel lived a good many years. He made an enormous contribution in so many fields of endeavour and it is a wrench when somebody like him is taken, even at this time. I join in speaking to the condolence motion to ensure that Lady Ermyn Bowen and Sir Nigel's daughters are aware of the way we feel about him and about his passing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I succeeded Sir Nigel as the member for Parramatta. I did not serve in the parliament with him. He left here in 1973, and in September of that year I was elected to succeed him. He had been a very fine representative in the parliament. I had been President of the Young Liberals and worked with him in that capacity over some years. I was very much aware of his contribution in Parramatta because I had been associated with the area for most of my life. As has been mentioned, between 1964 and 1973, whilst he was in the parliament, he had the privilege to serve as our foreign minister, Attorney-General and Minister for Education and Science. As has been remarked by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), he missed by only one vote as being chosen as Leader of the Opposition in 1972. In relation to that, I guess a number of stories could be told. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel's contribution to the Liberal Party was most significant. He brought stability and good sense to decision making. He was seen as having been a most significant contributor to policy development at a time the Liberal Party, having been in office for some 23 years, was seen as being vulnerable. More importantly, he was a popular local member of parliament, as I discovered only too quickly&mdash;I was often compared to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel's secretary was with me for a number of years. She was a very fine lady who always told me that, when Nigel was holding clinic&mdash;if one may use that term&mdash;in his Parramatta office, he would make sure that he walked the streets for some 15 to 30 minutes just to be seen about. I think all of that showed. He had that great eminence as a national leader, but his assiduous attention to the needs of his constituents, in my view, ensured that he held the seat of Parramatta when most other people thought it would have been lost. If my memory is correct, I think he won at that time by something of the order of 356 votes, which ensured that Michael Whealan did not have a career in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the Attorney-General's remarks because he drew very heavily upon the speech of a former member of this parliament&mdash;Bob Ellicott, formerly the member for Wentworth&mdash;at the state funeral. Bob's eulogy made a number of important points. Those first points about Nigel having being born in Canada and his family's early difficulties&mdash;the log cabin, the cherry orchard, the resumption by the railway, the move to Australia, the history of drought in Gunnedah, which I suspect is in the electorate of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair)&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0J4">Mr RUDDOCK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But close by. One of the things that people often thought about Nigel Bowen was that because he went to the King's School in Parramatta he was a person who would not understand what hardship and adversity meant and that because of his association with the King's School in Parramatta he should be held out to be some rather ephemeral character with little regard for the wishes and aspirations of ordinary people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was brought up in Ashfield. He was sent to the King's School because of the generosity of a paternal aunt, the same aunt who gave him a short period of education in the United Kingdom. He went to Sydney University on a Commonwealth scholarship and, on what I know from my own father's experience, a university exhibition, which was available to those who were in effect pledging their future in order to obtain an education. He also won an exhibition to St Paul's College, where he also had a very notable career as a general all-rounder, something that I think distinguished Sir Nigel through the whole of his career. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to make those points about Sir Nigel's early life because they link very well with some comments that Bob Ellicott had to make about Sir Nigel the politician. Because they were made by Bob Ellicott&mdash;a person whom I greatly admire, a person of great eminence himself&mdash;I think they mean so much more. I encourage those who want to know a bit more about Bob Ellicott to read his maiden speech in this parliament because it was another matter that distinguished him from many who come to this place. He had this to say of Nigel Bowen:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset it is important to understand the breadth of his political outlook. He was not a conservative. He had passionate concern for the country as a whole. He placed the interests of Australia first and above sectional attitudes and loyalties. He was a liberal thinker. But to him liberalism was a way of life not some cold principle of logic. He had a deep concern for the people and their welfare, for the rights of women and the individual's rights in the face of government. His political life bears testimony to all these things.</PARA>
<PARA>Nigel Bowen was a man who had achieved great eminence through his own efforts. When somebody like Bob Ellicott says, as he did, of Nigel Bowen that he regarded him as a leading silk at the New South Wales bar, as one of the leaders of the Australian bar and as an acknowledged expert in the fields of constitutional law, commercial law, industrial law, property law, company law, tax law, probate law as the breadth of his advisory practice, and that his opinion and advocacy were widely respected and sought, it means something. He added:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He appeared often and in a variety of cases both in trial and appellate courts. As the years passed his reputation as an appellate advocate grew as a study of Commonwealth law reports will quickly reveal. He appeared on a number of occasions in the Privy Council. I was able, while waiting for a case there to compare him with one of England's leading counsel. Nigel did not suffer from the comparison.</PARA>
<PARA>What distinguishes this man is that, notwithstanding that eminence, he saw fit to contest a seat for this parliament which was not a sinecure; it was always a seat that involved contest, as it does today. He gave up that career to come to this parliament. There are not many today, although there are some&mdash;and I look at some of my colleagues as I say this&mdash;who give up as much to come and serve in the parliament in the nation's interests. He did serve Australia in that way. I found him a very great and personal example, one that I was proud to follow into this parliament. I do share the particular distress of his family at his passing at this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, as the current member for Parramatta, to join this condolence motion to Sir Nigel Bowen. Parramatta is one of the electorates that has existed since Federation. As of today there have been 11 members for Parramatta. They have produced one Prime Minister and six senior cabinet ministers through that time. I think anyone who looks at that record would say that Sir Nigel Bowen's contribution to government and to the parliament compared well with those other distinguished representatives that went before him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, if you look at Sir Nigel Bowen's career both in the parliament in terms of portfolio responsibility and his later career and look at his predecessor as member in Sir Garfield Barwick, you will see they held a number of the same portfolios and both made in their own way&mdash;in very different characters, I would suggest, from my understanding of the history&mdash;substantial contributions to the parliament and to the law. They both had distinctive views and approaches in the area of foreign policy as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the member for Parramatta he was well regarded certainly by the people. I can recall the period around the 1972 election, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has already pointed out, when the seat of Parramatta was well contested. I think it is true to say that had there not been a candidate for the Liberal Party of the stature of Sir Nigel Bowen our prospects of winning the seat perhaps would have been realised. He was well regarded and performed well in a difficult election campaign, given his responsibilities, and retained the seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the memories I have of that particular period, whilst not agreeing with much of the government of the day's approach to foreign policy, is him speaking on a university campus. I think his understanding of Asia and Australia's place in Asia was certainly ahead of its time; it was very detailed. That was reflected in a comment that the Hon. Bob Ellicott made in the eulogy at the funeral where he indicated that Sir Nigel Bowen as foreign minister had proposed to the then Prime Minister the recognition of the People's Republic of China in early 1972&mdash;it is in that sort of time frame anyway&mdash;and that was rejected. I certainly recall at least one public meeting where his presentation about Australia's role with Asia was very expansive, demonstrated a real understanding of Australia's future direction and helped to set the scene for positive attitudes to changing foreign policy perspectives in the years that followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other members have spoken about his widely varied career. The thing that is notable is that he did maintain that sense of history in being a representative of the people in Parramatta who, as many members of the House would know&mdash;certainly the member for Berowra would know&mdash;regard their history very fondly. He maintained that tradition well. I think he served the parliament extremely well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Sir Frederick Stewart I was thinking of. Some very redoubtable people have represented that seat in the west of Sydney. As the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) said, Nigel always had a sense of history. Of the seat and its identity in the formation of this country of ours, there is little doubt that Nigel was very proud. I think it is important that, at a time when we tend to retrace our origins and at times rewrite history, we recall that there is nothing at all in our past, in the sense of the goodwill and good intent of those who have gone by, of which we should not be proud. That does not mean they did not make mistakes, and that does not mean that some of the things that happened over the course of the settlement of Australia are not things we should not regret. But I think at the same time the pride that Nigel Bowen had in our history is a matter deserving considerable commendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a minister he served, as has been identified, in three portfolios. I really wanted to identify a couple of aspects of two of them. The first was Attorney-General. People tend to forget Nigel's role in several aspects. First, it was he who, after very protracted debate, decided that the Federal Court should be established. There was significant discussion as to whether or not there should be a federal court. There were those who felt that the High Court should have jurisdiction, that the state supreme courts should exercise the role that the Federal Court now enjoys. Nigel was not of that persuasion. It was he who really, more than anybody else, persuaded cabinet to adopt the idea of a federal court and it was during his term as Attorney-General that the Federal Court was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also during that time, as has been commented on, he was the first to limit appeals to the Privy Council from the High Court of Australia. I think, again, that was an initiative which reflects very much a mood that we all endorse. But at that time it was a significant initiative because there was some doubt as to whether or not it was wise in the context of Australia's role in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen suggested a press council. It was he who sought to bring together, under an independent chairman, a body to consider complaints of unethical behaviour by the press. In that role, again, I suggest that he played a very mindful role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was not for long foreign minister, but as foreign minister there too, as the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested, he was one of those first to suggest Australia's identity with Asia. I well remember the belief that he had, and which quite strongly was held by the McMahon government in which Nigel was foreign minister, that it would be wrong to recognise the People's Republic of China if it meant that we had to reduce our recognition of Taiwan. Without doubt, it was essential that we recognise China. That was not the point. The difficulty we have today still in trying to lay down properly the relationship between Australia and Taiwan, and, of course, Taiwan's relations with other countries around the world, reflects the concerns that Nigel expressed then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of Nigel so nearly becoming Leader of the Opposition and leader of the Liberal Party, little has been said during the course of this condolence motion. But there was a comment that I think is worth remembering, and that was one that I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun</EMPHASIS> newspaper, I believe, of Sydney on 31 December 1972:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nigel Bowen QC had a number of offers to resume his legal career before he decided to contest the Liberal Party leadership last week.</PARA>
<PARA>Then it continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bowen's supporters now believe Nigel lost the leadership through the vote of one member who did not want to vote against Bowen but thought the job should go to a younger man. When the fourth ballot was tied, he was forced reluctantly to vote for Billy Snedden.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether or not that was so, I think it is of interest that Nigel himself felt that he was too old when he entered politics at the age of 57. There is little doubt that he made a remarkable contribution in spite of those feelings and, as has been suggested, had he been elected leader of the Liberal Party, I have little doubt that the history of the Liberal Party and, I believe, the coalition may well have varied significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was a great Australian. He certainly made a great contribution to the law outside the parliament as a judge of the court of appeal. Interestingly enough, he was sworn in as a member by the then Chief Justice of New South Wales, Mr Justice Kerr. He was subsequently, of course, chief judge, and he was also chief judge of the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those very good examples of the contribution Nigel Bowen made to the wider world was the fact that he believed it more appropriate to remain the member for Parramatta than to accept an appointment to the High Court. There is little doubt that, had the High Court received the benefit of his contribution, it too would have perhaps been a different place. I have no doubt that he also certainly had the qualifications to have been chief judge of the High Court of Australia. He was a remarkable constitutional lawyer, a tax lawyer and a company lawyer. He made a great contribution to Australia. To his widow and to his daughters, on behalf of Rosemary and me, I extend our deepest sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Saturday at the memorial service for Nigel Bowen, his friend and colleague the Hon. Bob Ellicott QC said this of him:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset it is important to understand the breadth of his political outlook. He was not a conservative. He had passionate concern for the country as a whole. He placed the interests of Australia first and above sectional attitudes and loyalties. He was a liberal thinker. But to him liberalism was a way of life not some cold principle of logic. He had a deep concern for the people and their welfare, for the rights of women and the individual's rights in the face of government. His political life bears testimony to all these things.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that quotation more than aptly sums up the substance of the man and what he believed in. My colleagues the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) and other members have spoken in detail on his earlier life and his overall contribution. There are a number of matters I would just like to refer to briefly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His war service perhaps has not been adequately covered and I shall therefore just mention it. His first service for Australia in a public sense was during the Second World War when he was appointed a captain of a quite unusual unit responsible for the landing of troops in New Guinea. His service there was quite unique for a number of reasons, not least of which was that the unit consisted of not only Captain Nigel Bowen but also Captain Frank Packer and Corporal Ninian Stephen. As was noted in the narration on Saturday, it was indeed quite a company!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 43rd Landing Craft Company was, as I said, a unique unit and one to which he made a significant contribution. He conducted himself as the adjutant with considerable bravery. It was a water transport unit responsible for the landing of Australian forces behind enemy lines on some occasions and certainly to carry the Australian forces forward against the Japanese in that sphere of operations. After the war he returned to the law and shared chambers on the second floor of Denman Chambers with some other interesting characters of Australian political history: Mr E.G. Whitlam and the then Mr Kerr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He subsequently was made a silk in 1953. As has already been noted, he had an immense advisory practice in company law, tax law, probate, constitution law&mdash;both commercial and industrial&mdash;as well as property law. By 1959 he had become the leading silk at the New South Wales bar and he was a very widely respected person in his profession. This was demonstrated by the fact that he was made President of the New South Wales Bar Association in 1959. In 1960 he was the Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1964, when Sir Garfield Barwick became Chief Justice, Nigel Bowen saw that as his opportunity to enter into federal parliament. He stood for preselection and was successful. He became, as we have heard, the member for Parramatta. In 1966 he was Attorney-General. Perhaps that was the period of greatest contribution to Australia in his parliamentary and legal roles because, as I said, he was a liberal and he wanted to see the system change in a way which was to the benefit of Australians. In that context, he applied his fundamental political values. He thought, for example, that the High Court should become the court of ultimate appeal for Australians. Subsequent to that, the previous arrangement by which Australians could appeal above the High Court to the Privy Council was disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He established a committee under Sir John Kerr to report on the system of administrative review to protect individuals from Commonwealth bureaucracy and a committee to reform the Judiciary Act to improve the federal system of justice. We have seen the results of that in the legislation that has gone through this chamber over the years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years people were talking about the need for a Federal Court, as has already been referred to by the right honourable member for New England. Again, he introduced legislation to that effect, although unfortunately perhaps, in a sense, he was not in the portfolio long enough to see that reach its achievement; nevertheless, he set the foundations which were subsequently carried through. In November 1969 he became Minister for Education and Science and in 1971 he became the Minister for Foreign Affairs until the McMahon government lost power. This was the period in which I got to know him best because at that stage I was in the diplomatic service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted by the right honourable member for New England, and certainly by Bob Ellicott last Saturday, that he saw the need to recognise communist China earlier than the government was prepared to at the time. The explanation given by the right honourable member for New England is an interesting postscript to this particular set of events. Nevertheless, it demonstrated at the time that he was conscious of the need for change, although change did not eventuate until the Whitlam government followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 I was appointed to a delegation by Mr Bowen and by the department to negotiate the seabed boundaries between what was then Indonesian West Timor and the north-west coast of Australia, through to Papua New Guinea and the Bensbach River. Those negotiations were very successful for Australia. In October 1972 he signed the treaty which eventuated and that recognised and accepted Australia's rights to the bulk of the seabed. The only part we missed out on and which at that stage we were unable to negotiate was what was then regarded as the Portuguese Timor section of what was then part of the Timor Gap. That has since been concluded by the Hawke government. It has brought and will no doubt continue to bring considerable wealth to Australia. It overcame what was potentially an embarrassment in Australia's relations with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the elections of 1972, he stood for the position of Leader of the Opposition, as has been noted by the right honourable member for New England: he missed by one vote. Historians may well question in the future what that meant to this country and what it meant to the Liberal Party, and what impact it could have had had he been successful. Nevertheless, that is only for the speculators of history. The fact is that he was not successful and he subsequently resigned from parliament and returned to the law. This is where, in a sense, he had his third career. Successively after 1973, he became a judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and Chief Justice in Equity, where again his quality as a judge was immediately recognised by his profession, the community and the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1976 the Federal Court of Australia Bill was passed and he became the Chief Justice. Being, in a sense, the father of the court, that was a very appropriate ending to his legal career at that stage. His chief justiceship of the Federal Court was probably his greatest contribution to our national life. That is not my judgment, it is the judgment of Bob Ellicott, but I think it is a fair one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quoting once again from his friend, who said on Saturday, `It is given to very few to excel in most aspects of their lives. It was given to him.' On behalf of my electorate in which he lived in his latter years, to those who knew him and his friends and relatives I extend my deepest sympathy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is remarkable, listening to the debate on this motion, to see how wide is the contribution to public life made by Sir Nigel Bowen, and also to see how deep is the quality of that contribution. He has had, as the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has pointed out, more than one career and he has excelled in them to an extent that any person would probably be proud to have in just one. My personal acquaintance with Sir Nigel Bowen is quite limited, but I value it nevertheless. My personal acquaintance probably began when I started reading judgments delivered by him in his judicial capacity. In the course of my years of practising law I have read many and they are well worth reading. I had a closer acquaintance with him when he was appointed the head of the Federal Court of Australia&mdash;a position first entitled `Chief Judge' and later changed to `Chief Justice'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking back from 1994, it is really remarkable that the Federal Court was established only in 1976&mdash;at least established under legislation in 1976: I think it commenced operations in 1977. It is a court that almost immediately obtained a reputation as a superior court at the federal level of the highest quality. It has now grown to a court of more than 40 and is still growing. There is no doubt that the reputation of the court was enhanced by the people who have been appointed to it, particularly the original appointees. I think the reputation was gained, to a considerable extent, by the leadership of Sir Nigel. He managed to weld a court into a very effective operating unit making a major contribution to public life in Australia, and the law in particular, in a very short time. He maintained that leadership throughout the 14 or 15 years that he was its head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He maintained also a strong link with the legal profession whence he had originally come. As has been mentioned, he was the President of the New South Wales Bar Association and he was the Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. His contact with the profession was a genuine and open one, not one merely designed to aid in the operations of the court. It is in that connection that I first encountered him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 I was the Chairman of the Federal Courts Committee of the Law Council of Australia. We made proposals to Sir Nigel for the establishment of a federal courts liaison committee. He readily acceded to that proposal. I can remember even now the discussions that were held in his magnificent office in the Federal Court building in Phillip Street, with its more than 180-degree view of Sydney harbour. That liaison committee was established and it survived the establishment of the federal litigation section of the Law Council in 1987. The connection he had with the profession, the esteem in which he was held, has resulted in his being one of only two persons ever to have been made an honorary life member of the Law Council of Australia. I am very proud to be able to say that I was the one who promoted that membership during a term of office that I had in the Law Council in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a profession&mdash;here I am talking about the legal profession, including the judiciary&mdash;which is highly critical of its own members, I cannot recall a harsh word or even a critical word ever being said about Sir Nigel, either as a barrister in his earlier years, or as a judge. He was the epitome of courtesy when one appeared before him. I join with those who have spoken in extending sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to briefly associate myself with the tributes that have already been paid to Sir Nigel Bowen. Along with the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), I was also present at the very impressive state funeral held at the Church of St James on Saturday and heard the really quite outstanding eulogy delivered by Bob Ellicott, a close friend of Nigel Bowen's and a former Commonwealth Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about his career and I will not retrace it. I served on Nigel Bowen's preselection committee, which I suppose is a practical contact with somebody who entered politics. It was a Saturday afternoon when the result was announced. He won on the second ballot from a field of about 15. It was in the dank basement of 30 Ash Street, which was then the Liberal Party's headquarters, that the result was announced by the then General Secretary of the Liberal Party, John Carrick, later a very close friend of Nigel's. In fact, Nigel departed the parliament in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember two incidents in particular which were a very real earnest of the man. When it was widely rumoured, and undoubtedly the case, in 1972 that he could have filled a vacancy which had arisen in the High Court of Australia, he had decided to hang on in Parramatta in circumstances where the omens were not good. I remember running into him at a Liberal Party gathering and expressing my admiration for his putting party before self. He said, `John, we have to win this one'&mdash;meaning the election. As history shows, we did not win the election despite his very best efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was held in very high regard. What impressed me most about him was his unfailing evenness and courtesy. He was always very courteous to people. He demonstrated that you could be a highly regarded, tough person and reach the pinnacle of your profession without engaging in bad manners. He was a good reminder of that characteristic, which occasionally I suppose we are all guilty of forgetting. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Experience in Australia and overseas has demonstrated that the capacity to protect key witnesses is a vital component in dealing effectively with serious crime, particularly organised crime. There are numerous ways a person may become a witness. These include being at the scene of a crime as an accomplice or innocent witness when it occurred or becoming aware of criminal activity and reporting those concerns to the authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the case of serious or organised crime, often it is those persons who have been intimately involved with a criminal activity who are in the best position to provide direct evidence or to corroborate evidence obtained from other sources, such as telephone intercepts. They need protection and this protection also needs to be extended to the families of such witnesses. The Witness Protection Bill arose from the parliamentary joint committee report on witness protection. The bill is intended to be the basis of complementary legislation by the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years, the Australian Federal Police has operated a witness protection program. Programs are also operated by most police forces, including the New South Wales, Victorian and Western Australian forces and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission. In the case of custodial protected witnesses, the primary protection is provided by corrective services agencies in each jurisdiction. By law, these agencies have the care and control of prisoners. In the case of New South Wales, the Department of Corrective Services has established a purpose-built high protection prison within the Long Bay Correctional Complex for those prisoners in that state who require a high degree of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary joint committee, or PJC, report recommended that the AFP should assume an expanded national protection role. In addition, the report recommended that legislation should underpin the scheme and that there be improved coordination and cooperation between the various law enforcement agencies and their clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Commonwealth-state-territory steering committee was established which identified the key issues which needed to be addressed in the model Commonwealth Witness Protection Bill. The steering committee and its subcommittees made an invaluable contribution to the development of the bill. In this regard, I would like to acknowledge the cooperation and contribution made by the state and territory ministers and their agencies and officers in developing the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an interim measure, in 1989 the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 was amended to permit the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to enter into arrangements with the commissioners of the state and territory police forces, the Chairperson of the National Crime Authority and Commonwealth and state-territory prescribed authorities to provide services for the protection of witnesses. This amendment has enabled the AFP to expand its program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maintenance of the integrity and accountability of the program is of vital concern to the government and the commissioner. The AFP members involved with the assessment and placement of persons on the program are operationally a discrete unit. This means that the witness's police case officer is not involved in the decision making process for placement on the program. The bill provides that key functions, such as removal and placement onto the program, may not be delegated below the position of Deputy Commissioner of the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protected witnesses may be removed from the program for a number of reasons provided by the act. For example, they may ask to be taken off the program. Another reason may be that with the passage of time and successful relocation and integration into a new community, they are no longer in a high risk category. There are other provisions such as breaching the memorandum of understanding, taking unnecessary risks with their own lives or committing offences while on the program. Any removal is subject to review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The witness protection program currently operated by the AFP is for that small number of key witnesses and their families requiring a high degree of protection because of serious threats to their lives. Its operation is based on relocation, change of identity and integration back into the community in a new identity. This enables the witness to give evidence without fear of retribution. It is proposed that the bill give legislative support to the AFP in the operation of its program. The processes and procedures set out in the bill have been honed and tested by the AFP in the operation of its current program. The bill amends the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 to enable the arrangement provisions to be relocated in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police to operate a national witness protection program, NWPP. The commissioner will be able to enter into arrangements with state-territory commissioners of police and chairpersons of bodies such as the National Crime Authority, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission to enable protection to be provided to witnesses of these authorities. These arrangements will include the recovery of operational costs. Placement on the NWPP is voluntary and is not to be given as a reward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedures are set out for the placement and removal of witnesses from the NWPP, safeguards surrounding the procedures for the issue of new federal documents, procedures to ensure that persons on the NWPP do not use the new identity to avoid civil or criminal liability and to enable foreign witnesses to be placed on the program. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs presented its report on the bill in June 1994. The committee expressed concern that the course of justice might be affected by the inability of an interested party to cross-examine a witness, with a new identity, about his/her prior convictions, for the purposes of testing his/her credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem referred to by the committee does not arise in the original proceedings for which the person has been granted protection. In this situation the person gives evidence in his/her original identity. The problem could arise in a case where a person, with prior convictions, had been given a new identity and is a witness to a new crime. In such a case, the person would be called to give evidence in his/her new identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's concerns were noted and clause 27 was included in the bill as a government amendment. The clause requires a witness who is called to give evidence in a criminal trial in these circumstances to notify the commissioner. The commissioner is then required to take appropriate action, including advising the court, the prosecutor and the accused person and his/her legal representative of the person's criminal record. It has been necessary to give the commissioner a discretion in such cases, as there could be a wide range of cases where the witness could be called to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, I propose to give the commissioner a direction that where the witness is called to give evidence for the prosecution in a serious offence&mdash;that is, one in which there is a real possibility of a gaol term or a substantial pecuniary penalty&mdash;the criminal record must be disclosed to the proper authorities. The direction would not be intended to cover other cases, such as where the person is to give evidence for the accused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was not prepared to extend this clause to all cases where a relocated person is called to give evidence. Once the criminal record is disclosed, the witness would almost invariably need to be given a new identity and relocated. This would cause considerable dislocation to that person and his/her family. This clause strikes a balance between the rights of an accused person and the rights and safety of persons who are, or who have been, on the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The placement of a foreign witness on the program is a further example of the government's international cooperation in the fight against serious or organised crime. Such a person may be able to give vital evidence in an Australian criminal trial or need to live outside his/her country of origin pending and following the trial coming on for hearing. Special conditions apply to the selection and placement of foreign witnesses on the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paramount consideration needs to be given to the protection of information held by the AFP on those persons on the program if the witnesses are to be truly safeguarded. The wider the information net extends, the greater the risk that the integrity of the scheme will be jeopardised. It is for these reasons that the usual administrative law review procedures have been changed. Decisions made under the bill will be exempt from the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. This approach recognises the absolute security requirements of the program. Questions relating to freedom of information and archives legislation are proposed to be addressed by separate amendments to the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AFP officers administering the program are subject to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. This means that complaints against them may be the subject of investigation by the ombudsman. To facilitate investigation of such complaints the ombudsman will have a right of access to the relevant program documents. Where a person is involuntarily removed from the program or where a new identity is removed, these decisions will be made by a deputy commissioner to enable the person to appeal to the commissioner against an adverse decision. The bill does not have any financial impact. The more important features of the bill are:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The genesis of the Witness Protection Bill was the 1988 report of the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority which examined witness protection arrangements in Australia. Prior to the inquiry, the NCA, exercising powers under the National Crime Authority Act 1984, could make arrangements for protection of witnesses appearing at hearings before the authority. The NCA, however, expressed the view that it did not have sufficient resources to set up its own witness protection scheme and that there were significant deficiencies in the facilities available for the protection of witnesses in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a response to this, the joint committee, in April 1987, began to pursue an inquiry into witness protection in Australia. The report examined four main areas in relation to witness protection. The first was the nature of witness protection and its role in the fight against organised crime. The second was the extent to which witness protection is an essential requirement of successful organised criminal investigation and prosecutions. The third was the extent to which organised crime witnesses were then presently protected and the nature, adequacy and cost of the arrangements. Finally, there was examination of the options available to the government to improve witness protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is drawn from the recommendations made by the joint committee in its report. It is an important piece of legislation. The core of the recommendations of the joint committee was that the Australian Federal Police should take on an expanded and a coordinating role in national witness protection programs. It was recommended that the AFP would provide services to state police forces on a user-pays basis. To facilitate coordination between police forces, it was further recommended that a witness protection liaison committee be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint committee made a number of other specific recommendations. However, only the core recommendations were given statutory force. In 1989 the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 was amended to allow the AFP to enter into arrangements with state and territory police forces and the NCA. In this bill, the government seeks to provide significantly greater legislative detail on witness protection. In doing so, the bill incorporates a number of the more specific recommendations of the joint committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, the bill establishes a national witness protection program, NWPP, to be operated by the AFP. The NWPP is designed to enable witnesses to give evidence without fear of retribution and to provide for protection of persons who, because of their association with the witness, need protection. In practice, this is likely to most frequently apply to the witness's family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides significant matters of detail concerning the operation of the NWPP, including procedures for witness placement, placement of foreign witnesses, contractual type arrangements between witnesses and the AFP, the obligations of disclosure by witnesses and the disclosure of witness information to other bodies. It also provides for offences. It is intended, as the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) pointed out, that the arrangements in the bill will be complemented by state and territory legislation. Again, the bill has not incorporated all the recommendations made by the joint committee in its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill as originally introduced into the Senate was considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee received submissions and conducted hearings on the bill. The Senate committee's principal concerns about the bill in its then form were for the protection of the interests of third parties. As a result of the committee's recommendations, the government has introduced amendments to the bill which were stated in the supplementary explanatory memorandum tabled with the amendments to have three main purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first purpose is to provide further protection of the rights of third parties. To this end the commissioner of the AFP is to be authorised to notify a party or possible party to legal proceedings involving the witness that the commissioner would accept service of legal process on behalf of the witness. This is now subclause 15(2) of the bill. This will assist creditors and those who have child maintenance and other entitlements under Family Court orders against the protected witness. It is important that the witness not be enabled by his or her participation in the program to avoid his or her existing financial and other obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose is to avoid the NWPP protection facility being an inducement to a potential witness to give desirable evidence in exchange for protection. In this connection, the AFP is to be authorised to disclose to a court or a tribunal details of the financial support arrangements provided to the witness. But the nature of the disclosure is to be such that the court will not be able to identify the location, or to prejudice the safety, of the witness. This is now in subclause 26(5) of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements, particularly the financial arrangements, could be an issue before the court or tribunal in which the witness is to give evidence. It is a principle of the bill, expressed in clause 5, that a witness will not be included in the program as a reward or as a means of persuading or encouraging the witness to give evidence or to make a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee was concerned to ensure that the criminal record of the protected witness is preserved. Giving a person a new identity under the NWPP effectively wipes out his or her past. Under the bill, any past criminal record does not attach to the new identity. The Senate committee considered that, in its previous form, the bill was not clear about the extent to which defence counsel would be able to investigate the background of a protected witness who will probably in all cases be giving vital evidence and whose credibility will probably in all cases be at issue. It is important that an interested party be able to cross-examine such a witness about prior convictions for the purpose of testing his or her credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the third purpose of the government's amendments is to compel a protected witness who is later required to give evidence in criminal proceedings in his or her new identity to advise the commissioner of the AFP. The commissioner may then give a copy of the person's convictions to the court, the prosecutor and the accused or his or her legal representative. This may require the witness to be provided with a further new identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, clause 27 does not compel the commissioner to disclose a witness's criminal record to the relevant parties. The effect of subclause 27(2) is that, after being notified by the witness of the requirement to give evidence, `the commissioner may take any action he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances, including disclosing to the court, the prosecutor and the accused person or the accused person's legal representative the criminal record of the participant or former participant'. This means that the commissioner retains the discretion to inform or not inform the court before which the witness is to give evidence that that person has a criminal record in his or her former identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a golden thread of our system of justice that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Consistent with that presumption, the accused person's defence counsel must be able to challenge the credibility of any prosecution witness and thus test the reliability of the evidence of the witness in order for justice to run its proper course. For this purpose, it is important that an accused person have access to the criminal record of a witness on whose evidence he may be convicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In civil proceedings, a person's liberty may not be at risk. However, the proceedings may put at risk a person's entire worldly wealth, and often large sums of money are involved. Again, it is unjust that a person may be liable to lose significant property or incur a significant liability on the strength of incompletely tested evidence from a witness who is possibly unreliable. For this reason, it is also desirable that a formerly protected witness who has a new identity be compelled to disclose his or her criminal record through the commissioner of the AFP to the civil court in which that witness is to testify. In the explanatory memorandum, the minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that where the person is called to give evidence for the prosecution, in a serious offence&mdash;that is, one in which there is a real possibility of a gaol term or substantial pecuniary penalty&mdash;the criminal record be disclosed to the proper authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory memorandum goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not intended that the criminal record be disclosed in other cases, such as where the person is called to give evidence for the accused.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not the purpose of an explanatory memorandum to give such guidance in the exercise of a statutory discretion nor is it appropriate to have recourse to the explanatory memorandum in order to properly understand clause 27 of the bill. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, in certain circumstances consideration may be given by a court to extrinsic material&mdash;including an explanatory memorandum&mdash;if such material is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision in an act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Acts Interpretation Act makes it clear that such material is to be considered only in one of two sets of circumstances. The first is where it is necessary to confirm that the meaning of the provisions is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision in its context. That is not the present case. The second set of circumstances is where the provision is ambiguous or obscure or its ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd or unreasonable and the consideration of the extrinsic material is necessary to determine the true meaning of the provision. That also is not the present case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On my reading, subclause 27(2) clearly gives the commissioner a discretion in all cases. In contrast, the explanatory memorandum appears to mandate action by the commissioner in certain cases. In my view, it is doubtful that resort can be had under the Acts Interpretation Act to the explanatory memorandum in order for a court to be able to narrow or qualify the commissioner's discretion given by that clause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the minister refer to this issue in his second reading speech, which he has just delivered. In the course of it, he suggested that he would give a direction as to disclosure in trials for serious offences involving the threat of imprisonment or serious financial penalties. Not having had the opportunity to examine that proposal, I am not aware upon what it is based. But I question the effect of a direction by the minister to the commissioner in the light of the very clear language of clause 27(2). That provision clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Commissioner may take any action he or she considers appropriate in the circumstances, including disclosing to the court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and to certain identified persons&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a witness's criminal record.</PARA>
<PARA>I would be surprised if a court would interpret a provision to that effect as enabling the minister to give a direction to the commissioner as to how his discretion should be exercised in the absence of some specific power in the legislation to which it relates. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V5">Mr WILLIAMS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am actually grateful for the interjection because it confirms the very point that I was seeking to make. In this bill, we have a discretion specifically conferred on an officer in very prescribed, precise circumstances. The minister is referring to another piece of legislation. The two have to be married together. In the ordinary course of events, this being the later and specific bill, a general power will not override it. I do not know the answer to it. I have not researched it. I only heard about it when the minister delivered his second reading speech. But I would urge the minister to examine it very closely to make sure that what he seeks to do can, in fact, be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue was raised and debated in the Senate during the consideration of the bill in detail, irrespective of the specific point that I just sought to make, and the solution is somewhat inadequate. The solution is now in clause 30 of the bill. It is basically an accountability provision. It does not purport to be a preventative measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 30 requires the commissioner to keep the minister informed of the general operations, performance and effectiveness of the NWPP and, in particular, the exercise of the commissioner's powers under clause 27 of the bill. It also requires the minister to report annually to parliament on the witness protection program and the exercise of powers under it. Clause 27 provides a form of continuing review of the exercise by the commissioner of his or her discretion. This is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Parliamentary scrutiny, in however crude a form, is essential. But it does not remove, limit, or prescribe guidelines for, the exercise of that discretion. It will not prevent the situation arising in which an accused can be convicted on the evidence of a witness who has an undisclosed criminal record. If it is later revealed in the minister's annual report to the parliament that an accused person was convicted in a case in which the criminal record of the formerly protected person was not disclosed, that accused person would&mdash;arguably&mdash;have grounds for appeal against the conviction. Obviously this situation must be avoided. Nor will the provisions of clause 30 go any way towards preventing or monitoring the occasions in which a defendant or a plaintiff in civil proceedings is unsuccessful at trial because of the incompletely tested credibility of a witness with an undisclosed criminal record. I suggest that this is an unsatisfactory situation. Clauses 27 and 30, when read together, are inadequate in this vital area. I urge the government to examine how, by appropriate amendment, the interests of all parties involved might be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill makes consequential amendments to a number of acts. It exempts decisions relating to the program from review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. It was a recommendation of the parliamentary joint committee that appropriate mechanisms be established to handle complaints from persons who believe that they have been unjustly denied protection, or who are aggrieved by decisions made by agencies in the administration of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exclusion of the decisions from review under the ordinary judicial review process is understandable. But the need for appropriate mechanisms of review for the situations referred to by the joint committee remains. This, plainly, needs more attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the explanatory memorandum, the government states that the bill will have no financial impact. However, in clause 9(2)(f), the bill provides that among the matters which the memorandum of understanding&mdash;the contract between the commissioner and the witness containing the terms under which the witness is to be granted protection under the program&mdash;may contain is a financial support arrangement. This suggests that the bill will have some financial impact. Indeed, it would appear that the cost of relocating, protecting and providing a new identity for a witness and his or her family is potentially an extremely expensive process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is invited to address this in his response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires that a prospective participant in the program make full disclosure of the matter set out in clause 7, before the person is accepted. The coalition is concerned that this requirement applies without any protection being given against self-incrimination. The matters to be disclosed include details of the following: the witness's criminal history; court orders relating to sentences imposed on the witness to which the witness is subject in relation to criminal prosecutions; financial liabilities and assets; any cash held by the witness, whether in accounts or otherwise; any business dealings in which the witness is involved; and all outstanding debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the applicant is not admitted to the program, he or she is entitled to these private details not being generally available either publicly or to the police. In fact, the scheme is likely to fail completely if information provided under clause 7 by a prospective protected witness is then used to prosecute the applicant or to enable another agency to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that this is an important piece of legislation. It deals with significant matters of law enforcement and the interests of private citizens. At law, one's legal identity defines one's relationship with the family, with one's livelihood and career, with the country of which one is a part, with those with whom one does business or by whom one is employed or whom one represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Psychologically, legal identity defines our relationship in all these facets and with all these persons. Identity is really the core of our existence. The ability of a state to sanction and support the alteration of legal identity is a very significant act. It is significant not only for the person whose identity is altered but also for those with whom he or she has a relationship, whether emotional, legal or otherwise. This bill deals not only with emotions and psychology but with legalities. It seeks to provide a legal basis by which alteration of identity may occur. It must also ensure that it properly protects the rights and interests of those with whom the person whose identity has been changed had or may yet have a legal relationship in his or her original identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by noting a comment referred to in a letter  from Senator Spindler to the minister that is annexed to the report of the Senate committee. The observation by an American commentator is that witness protection in the United States is the `most unusual service ever offered by any government during peacetime'. Perhaps the same might be said in respect of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) that there is one thing he did not mention about the importance of the Witness Protection Bill: it also involves questions of life and death. This bill has its genesis in the Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. It had its genesis when I received a phone call in my office from a woman who is commonly known around Australia these days as Miss X. Miss X was related to a well-known Melbourne criminal in Richmond. Through that association, a de facto relationship, she became involved in heroin, drug running, murder and other vile and notorious criminal acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the family involved were murdered. Victorian police became involved and Miss X became part of an embryonic witness protection program that the Victorian police force established. In order to protect Miss X from death&mdash;because that was the end result of her becoming an informant, no ifs or buts about that&mdash;the Victorian police took this lady to Mt Gambier in South Australia to hide her in a location where they believed she would be safe. I think the expression they use is a `safe house'. Of course, the Victorian police have no jurisdiction in South Australia, in Mt Gambier. Miss X had been in the place only for a month when one day she was  raided by the South Australian police force. Someone had recognised her and had told the South Australian police force that this notorious criminal was in Mt Gambier. Being good police, the South Australian police force raided her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In absolute fear and panic, realising that she had no safety in South Australia and that her protection had been blown, she fled to Tasmania. On the way she purchased a revolver and ammunition, which she was carrying. She contacted my office from Tasmania and told me the story. That is where my interest in this area of witness protection commenced&mdash;all through a person known as Miss X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, she has been involved in matters which have involved Rogerson and Flannery, among other notorious murderers and criminals in this country. She is now under a witness protection program. I have not spoken to her for some time. She had the habit of ringing me on the telephone every now and again to have a chat with me. Although I have met her only once in person, in the flesh, over the years we did have a rather strange relationship, she as an informant telling me about areas of organised criminality. I recall one day we were speaking on the phone and she told me where five bodies were buried in Melbourne, information which, quite frankly, as a politician I did not particularly want to know. That was passed on to appropriate sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this bill is about life and death. Because people in the position of Miss X who come out, as it were, from an organised criminal group and dob their mates in, who become a squirrel or a turkey, who whistle, who give evidence against their friends, in the criminal world are dead&mdash;no ifs, no buts about it. So when as chairman of the joint parliamentary committee I had those discussions with Miss X, I was pleased that the committee agreed to accept that we should have an inquiry into witness protection in Australia. The committee, I might add, never met Miss X. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of that inquiry we travelled throughout Australia. We met with protected witnesses, those protected by the then Australian Federal Police force witness protection program. I recall being in Sydney, where we had arranged to take evidence from some of these people. The federal police force picked us up at the airport and put us in individual unmarked cars, each of us in a different car. We were driven around different circular routes in Sydney to make sure we were not being followed. Eventually we found ourselves in a motel and met with two quite famous protected witnesses in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their evidence was quite unequivocal. If their whereabouts were ever discovered, they were dead&mdash;not only them but their families. That is the way we were told the system operated. Once you squealed, your family were targeted. In some ways for the committee it was quite a harrowing journey through the underworld and through criminality, to see the real underworld that exists and the real threats that people face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also unarguably true that the Miss Xs and other people of that ilk who come from the criminal world and who are prepared, through threat of prosecution, through fear engendered by their activities, or for whatever reason, to give evidence, are the keystones of the attack on organised crime. It is unarguable for those who have looked at  criminality in Australia and who have any understanding of it at all that the informant is the most prized possession any police investigation unit can have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my own days in the Victorian police force, when the CIB of the day had a cash fund available to it. Its primary job as uniformed or non-uniformed officers was to encourage what were commonly known in the trade as fizzers. A fizzer was a criminal who would for money or for other reasons be prepared to discuss with a member of the police force activities of other criminals. I can say without equivocation that the vast bulk of major crime is solved only by the use of these informants. But once the informers are known, say goodbye to them. It is that simple. So the inquiry was, for many members and certainly for me, a journey through the underworld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people whom I think this House should thank, seeing we now have both the report and the legislation. One of those people the House should acknowledge in this respect is a former superintendent of the Victorian police force, a chap called John Barclay. John and I went to school together. We are both famous graduates of the Preston technical school. There are not that many famous graduates of the Preston technical school because it no longer exists. It is now called the college. John and I grew up together and joined the police force at different periods, where I met John again. John was the recipient of a Churchill scholarship. John was fortunate under that scholarship to have travelled to the United States and to have spent a number of months studying the US protection program run by the US marshals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John came back to Victoria with a very full and detailed report on the way that the marshals program operates in the United States. I believe that, in the course of that inquiry, John was quite generous in giving the committee a full copy of that report, including the recommendation he had made to the Victorian government, which was that the Victorian government should institute such a program. In fact, it did in some ways have such a program going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the trouble with the states having programs is that crime is not state located. Indeed, crime is not national. Crime is international. Only this afternoon, I was reading an article from Hong Kong which detailed a couple of investigations involving Chinese importers and exporters of heroin. The article gave quite a detailed explanation of how two particular Chinese groups had operated out of Hong Kong, involving both Triad and non-Triad Chinese activities. That particular activity involved Australia, the United States, the Philippines and Thailand, and it involved transferring through money laundering activities close to $US100 million from various points around the world to various supposedly safe places where those funds could be used to the benefit of the people involved in the heroin trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when we talk about crime today, we are not talking about state crime or about Australian crime. When we talk about major crime, organised crime is the usual term we use. That is a bit of a misnomer but we use that term because television and the media love it. If we talk about organised crime, we are talking about international crime on a huge scale, an enormous scale of billions of dollars a year. When a person from inside one of those groups has information that enables you to detect, charge and gaol someone, I believe it is incumbent on you to ensure that that informant lives, because if the system does not work you will not get more informants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, the witness protection program is designed to create a new identity. The recommendation of the committee is that there be a national program. This is what this legislation would do. Indeed, some of the states some years back started passing complementary state legislation as part of the overall picture of the national program. I recall my colleague the Hon. Jim Kennan, when he was the Attorney-General for Victoria, putting up the original Victorian legislation, which was in advance of the Witness Protection Bill. In fact, having spent three years out of this place, I find it somewhat surprising to come back and be debating legislation which was recommended in my first period here. It may say something about the pace of change in important areas, but so be it. I am pleased to see it finally going through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states are heavily involved. I know that in Victoria the now Minister for Police and Emergency Services, the Hon. Pat McNamara, recently removed the sunset clause from the legislation that Jim Kennan introduced. I do not know what the other states are up to, but I hope that the other states are now passing complementary legislation so that we will have a national overview and indeed the ability to take a person needing the protection of the program from one state to another state. It is far too dangerous to leave a person at risk in, for example, Sydney if that is where he comes from. It is imperative that that person be relocated with a new identity far away from his original home and his original activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> You can well imagine what that involves. In this House, it sounds very simple to just pass legislation, create systems, pay money to these people and even arrange for foreign places where they might be safer. But can you imagine the effect of that on an individual, spouse and children; the difficulties that it creates? How do you explain to children that, as from tomorrow, they will be known as Jones instead of Smith? How do you ensure that children, when they go to a different school, will not say that their name is Smith, not Jones, and that their daddy comes from wherever? How do you ensure that in the program there is no leakability&mdash;no possibility of people leaking information as to true identity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What of the spouses&mdash;the innocent parties, if you like, of the whole system? They have to uproot themselves from extended family to be relocated in a new address with a new name, and are not necessarily able to use a telephone or mail for contact because that, would you believe, is also too risky. Sadly, it is not possible to say that people do not get access to telephone sources and, sadly, it is not possible to say that people do not get access to postal sources. Money speaks a very big language, and sometimes it speaks too big a language and is too big a temptation for some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can you imagine what it involves to go through this total change of identity? People have to change marriage certificates, educational qualifications and tertiary qualifications; they have to recreate the paper history that we all have somewhere in our cupboards, filing cabinets, banks or wherever we keep our papers; they have to recreate uncles and cousins so that there is continuity to the story; and they have to recreate their trade qualifications and work history. How do you go and get a job if you cannot prove your qualifications or if you have no references from where you previously worked? It is an enormously difficult concept to come to grips with. It is very difficult to legislate for but it is going to be more difficult to put it into place and make sure it works. It is, as I think honourable members today have said, an enormously important piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows from what this government has done since 1983 with the seizure of assets legislation. There has never been in this country's history such a major legislative attack on organised crime&mdash;never. In a relatively short space of time, this government has changed forever the face of the attack on organised crime. For example, the case in the article I was reading today, which I just referred the House to, involved an Australian connection. In that particular case, assets worth $24.6 million were seized in Australia alone. So all of the legislation we have passed is important in the total approach and attack on organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to go through the detail of the bill. Members such as the honourable member for Tangney can go through it clause by clause but, to me, the important thing is that the legislation is finally before the House. Members of the committee travelled to some strange places in Australia to take evidence and were part of preparing the report. We visited many gaols. In fact, many members probably do not know that, even within gaols in Australia, it is necessary to have different sections where certain people are protected from other prisoners because they are known as informants. Those people who inform and are convicted themselves end up in a prison within a prison. It is pretty frightening when you go into a gaol and realise that these people have to be segregated within a gaol. The moment they go outside of the internal walls of their own protection unit, they are dead&mdash;inside a gaol. So it is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to again thank all members of the committee. I am awfully pleased that the recommendations have been accepted. I am concerned that some of the states still do not seem to be moving in the direction I would wish. It is surely time that crime is seen for what it is&mdash;national and international. It is surely time for some of the smaller states to recognise that it is time to tear down the state barriers. We desperately need a national criminal code. So why, in 1994, are we still talking about states rights when the threats we now face from around the world are far more important than the little power people want to take in the states to have their own judicial systems or their own criminal systems? We really do need, like this bill provides, a national overview. If I can do anything in this House in the remaining years I will spend here, it will be to continue to push for national approaches to control and attack organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, if Miss X is out there listening to this debate today, she should know that she has been responsible in a way for this legislation because she drew the attention of one backbencher to a major problem. As a result, the joint committee had the inquiry and produced the report and now the bill is before this House. If Miss X is listening, I would like her to know that she has achieved something. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to express solidarity with the people of Lebanon and, in particular, with 300,000 of my fellow Australians of Lebanese extraction whose homeland is still suffering under a long reign of terror. I am aware that Lebanon is not the only country suffering at this time from war, rapine, pillage and foreign sponsored genocide. Other examples, obviously, are Bosnia and Rwanda, but evil does not cease being evil just because it has existed for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us recall that between independence in 1942 and the Syrian invasion in 1975 Lebanon was the nearest thing to a liberal society in the Arab world. Its women were free, its minorities were respected and its living standards were relatively high. It was often described as the Switzerland of the Middle East. When tens of thousands of Palestinians fled their then homes in 1948, Lebanon provided these people with a sanctuary and in many instances a much more welcoming sanctuary than the other Muslim countries neighbouring on Israel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a perfect democracy. It was more like a federation of communities of which the most significant were, of course, the Christian Maronites, the Sunni Muslims, the Shi'ah Muslims and the Druze living together with a power sharing arrangement. Lebanon was not perfect. At times there was some discrimination. Obviously some communities by and large lived better than other communities, but it was a civil society&mdash;a society where people could expect to leave their homes and be protected, where people could go to the police and be protected and where people could go to the courts and be respected. It was a society where the rights of Muslims were respected by the Christians and the rights of Christians were respected by the Muslims. And it was a bridge between East and West, a beacon of those values of liberty, tolerance and prosperity&mdash;values which are not simply Western values, although the West has possibly given better expression to them than other parts, values indeed which are universal aspirations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was destroyed in 1975. It is interesting that those who intervened in 1975 posing as the saviours of the persecuted Muslim majority in fact came from a country which had no or very little respect for its own minority people. The Syrian government under President Assad was guilty of the most appalling atrocities against its own citizens, most significantly the massacre of 20,000 people in the town of Hama. Of course, in Lebanon it eventually became oppressive of all the people. The friends of Syria murdered not just Christian people but also the Grand Mufti of Lebanon. President Mouawad was murdered because he was insufficiently sympathetic to the Syrian objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak not as someone who is pro-Christian, pro-Muslim, pro-Druze, pro-Israel or anti-Syrian. I just believe that the Syrian army should return to its own country. I speak as someone who is pro-freedom, pro-liberal democracy and pro-Lebanon. I ask that there be an immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, that there be free elections under UN supervision as soon as is reasonably possible and that the Australian embassy return to Beirut as soon as is reasonably practical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the recent Parramatta by-election campaign in New South Wales indicated that the return of the embassy would be made in July of next year. Why not now? Why can we not have an embassy in Beirut now as a sign of our nation's solidarity with the Lebanese people? If the US, British and French embassies could remain open through all the troubles of those countries, even though they were bombed and their nationals were being kidnapped, why could our embassy not be there then? Certainly our embassy should be there again now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thursday, 29 September was World Maritime Day and, as parliament was not sitting at that time, this is an appropriate time to consider the role of shipping and pay tribute to the seafarers of the world. It is also particularly appropriate when there has been much debate over recent weeks about the role of Australian shipping and its future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, World Maritime Day was especially significant as it was the day after the ferry <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Estonia</EMPHASIS> was lost in the Baltic Sea with the tragic loss of more than 900 lives. There are particular difficulties with ferries in the Baltic which have been raised with me on recent trips to that part of the world. I am sure everyone has been horrified by the tragic loss of life from this maritime disaster. I was particularly interested in what the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) said in answer to the question from the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith) about the Tasmanian ferry today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I learned of this disaster while attending a two-day seminar in Sydney entitled `Ship Shape for the 21st Century'. This was an excellent seminar dealing with aspects of international shipping post <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS>. I give my congratulations to BHP Transport in association with Lloyds of London Press, which organised this important conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia as an island continent is more dependent on shipping than most other countries. It is because of this dependence that I have over recent months strenuously opposed the suggestion to sell off the Australian National Line. As I have said in this House many times, the world's fleet is ageing and there is an increasing lack of trained personnel both at the officer and rating level. Australia must not put its shipping line at the mercy of foreign owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a suggestion recently that Australia open a second register for shipping. I am pleased that this scheme now seems to have been sunk, and most appropriately so. It is interesting that the opposition calls for the Australian coast to be opened to foreign shipping with Australian ships having Australian officers but crews from Burma, the Philippines, Pakistan or various other places. The same claims are not made of our airlines. If it is good enough to open the Australian coast to foreign shipping, why not open the Australian airways as well? We could have the good old Aussie officer sitting up there in the nose of the plane and those running up and down rattling the drinks trolley, especially in front of the conservative members of this chamber, could be from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or, indeed, to add a really exotic touch, Myanmar. What is the difference if we are going to have people from these countries crewing our ships along the Australian coastline? Why do we not have them crewing our airlines as well?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we moved decisively to end slavery in Australia 90 years ago by stopping the recruitment of Kanak labour, why are some now suggesting that we introduce slavery into Australia?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who served on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ships of shame</EMPHASIS> inquiry know the conditions that seafarers are put into&mdash;low pay, being half starved and physically and sexually abused.

If members of this House believe that this does not happen, I invite them to talk to any officials from the Missions of Seamen around the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `Ship Shape' conference brought together leading experts from 19 countries. I was particularly impressed with the conference's determination to rid the seas of unsafe shipping. Those involved know that unsafe shipping not only brings all shipping into disrepute but also costs everyone money. These were leading experts from throughout the world, and the message that they kept putting was that, more than anything else, for world shipping&mdash;not only Australian shipping&mdash;we have to rid the world's oceans of these ships of shame. I believe that we must commit ourselves to maintaining cabotage around our Australian coast. We should also pay tribute to those seafarers who go down to the sea in ships. Long may they continue to do so in Australian flagged and crewed ships. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked by a group of concerned citizens within my electorate to report to the parliament on a hearing loss forum that was conducted and coordinated in Port Macquarie recently. I will open with the  letter from Mrs Flo Flavell which asks me to do this. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find enclosed a report advising results of Hearing Loss Forum held 12.9.94 at Port Macquarie. I am also enclosing on a separate sheet comments made by people who attended the forum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The forum was a great educational success, and from the comments made at the forum, and the phone calls of appreciation received since, the forum covered a lot of territory that has been unchartered for the hearing impaired until now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would humbly request you to table this report in Federal Parliament to bring the report to the attention of the members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A resolution was passed at the Forum that the Federal Member for Lyne, Mr Mark Vaile, MP be asked to recommend to the Federal Government that all Federal Government Employees receive a Program of Training on Customer Service for the Hearing Impaired.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, this hearing loss forum was conducted in Port Macquarie. As honourable members would no doubt be aware, a large population of retired and elderly people live in that part of New South Wales. Mrs Flavell mentioned that the idea of holding the forum evolved from personal experiences&mdash;Mrs Flavell herself has a hearing disability&mdash;she has encountered over the 15 years she has worn hearing aids. She has worked with and listened to comments from hearing impaired people, especially the elderly, about the frustrations and embarrassment of trying to hear in public places such as  churches, theatres, auditoriums, meeting rooms, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most difficult problems the hearing impaired encounter in day-to-day living occur when they try to use over-the-counter services in banks, post offices, motor registry offices, Social Security, CES and the like. The reason is that there is a lot of background noise in these places by the very nature of the services they provide.To solve these problems, a loop mat unit was demonstrated at the forum. This unit can be placed on counters or desks in areas serving the public such as tellers' counters in banks. The loop mat, working in conjunction with the T switch in the hearing aid, will eliminate background noises and will allow the hearing impaired to conduct their business in privacy like those not suffering from hearing disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loop mat unit is compact, light and portable. It can be easily moved and is reasonably priced. Installing audio loops in churches allows the hearing impaired to hear the service. By installing the loop in auditoriums and meeting rooms, hearing impaired members can participate in meetings and thereby are not deprived of the rights that other members enjoy. Loops in theatres will allow them to enjoy entertainment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution passed at the forum was that the Hon. Ms Wendy Machin, state member of parliament for Port Macquarie, and Mr Mark Vaile, federal member for Lyne, be asked to recommend to the state and federal government that all state and federal government employees receive a program of training on customer service for the hearing impaired. Seventy people attended this forum. Amongst those present were representatives of business houses and service providers who  had accepted an invitation to attend. There were representatives from the RTA and Social Security, managers of state and ANZ banks, the inspector of police and an audiologist from Australian Hearing Services. Also, 10 pupils who are taking a CES course in nursing assistance attended and were accompanied by a teacher. The students asked questions and said that they gained a lot of knowledge from the forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forum also identified a number of areas that should be targeted as far as an educational process is concerned, such as post offices, banks, doctors' surgeries, solicitors' offices, police stations, court houses, motor registries, theatres, auditoriums, meeting rooms, motels, television stations, and, most importantly, as far as this address tonight is concerned, Commonwealth operated government offices, where we should be thinking of providing the service not just to some sections of the disabled community but to all sections. Providing the loop mats in Social Security offices, CES offices and other Commonwealth offices is not an expensive exercise to undertake. I commend the recommendation of this forum to the government to investigate. </PARA>

He is currently studying in year 10 at St Laurence's College. He is planning a career as a commercial pilot, already having flown more years than pilots several years his senior.

It stunned me to see this young fellow, bright as you like, at about 9 o'clock in the morning. Obviously he had left Glendambo at first light. I quickly add, before people get concerned, that his flying instructor was in the second seat with him. This young fellow showed enthusiasm and sheer audacity by flying all around Australia and right across some pretty isolated country. Think of that stretch between Tennant Creek, Glendambo and Port Augusta! The sense of adventure, the sense of having a go, is well and truly alive. </PARA>

The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HEROC), the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court (pursuant to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977) and the Ombudsman are some examples of Commonwealth institutions where aggrieved individuals can seek remedies for violation of their civil and political rights.</PARA>

Australia acceded to the First Optional Protocol on 25 September 1991. This means that the Committee can consider complaints of alleged violations under the Covenant by Australia which occurred on, or after, the 25 December 1991. A complainant must exhaust all available domestic remedies before lodging his or her complaint with the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A "funding formula" is not used to allocate operating grant funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1996 funding for growth was targeted to regions of high population growth and low tertiary participation. More particularly, places were allocated to higher education institutions that were allocated funding for the capital development of new campuses. Over the 1994-96 triennium $15.6 million has been allocated to the Queensland University of Technology for the capital development of the new campus on the Sunshine Coast, and further funds of up to $5 million will be provided in 1997 on condition that an agreement can be reached with the State Government over an appropriate level of State support for the development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) As the University College of the Sunshine Coast is a campus of the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) funding under the HEEP is provided to QUT on the basis of its equity achievements. The HEEP funding allocation for QUT for 1994 was $108,000. However, this amount will be increased by around 25% ($28,000) following the recent announcement of an additional $1m for HEEP funds in 1994 and future years. The extra $1m has been transferred from the National Priority (Reserve) Fund and brings total HEEP funds for 1994 to around $5m. Queensland University of Technology will decide what proportion of its funding allocation will be allocated to equity initiatives at the University College of the Sunshine Coast.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In accordance with legislative provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (the Act), the Australian Electoral Commission may declare a place to be a pre-poll voting office by publishing a notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
