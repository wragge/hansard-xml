<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege which concerns the conduct some weeks ago of the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton). I should inform the House that I notified the Minister for Industrial Relations that I would be raising a matter of privilege affecting him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of privilege arises out of an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 29 March 1994, written by Pamela Williams, the national correspondent of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. It concerns recent appointments to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Briefly, the article recounted that there had been much speculation about who would be appointed to the positions of deputy president of the commission&mdash;one position dealing with enterprise bargaining and the other position dealing with the superintendency of the award section of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was widely rumoured in industrial relations circles that one Roger Boland, who is the industrial relations director of the Metal Trades Industry Association of Australia, was in fact the favoured candidate of the minister for the position of deputy president in charge of the bargaining division. But that was before Mr Boland gave evidence before a Senate committee investigating the provisions of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that sworn evidence, Mr Boland raised a number of concerns about the legislation, was generally critical of aspects of it and, from his vast industrial relations experience, cast doubt upon whether it would achieve the ends that the government had in mind. Apparently that was too much for the minister, and I will come in a moment to why that is relevant to my submission. I take up verbatim the article of Pamela Williams:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But four weeks ago, Mr Boland's telephone rang. It was Mr Brereton. He explained that while Mr Boland was the plum for the job, there was a problem. And the problem was Mr Boland's position before the Senate inquiry in stirring up opposition to the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Brereton said he would think about the problem. The next day, a press release was issued announcing Mr Ross&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>straight out of the ACTU office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as head of the bargaining division, and Mr Tony McIntyre, a partner at Blake Dawson Waldron, as head of the award division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A traditional Labor knee-capping. Mr Boland still believes the legislation represents lost opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA>What is material is the conditions that govern the molestation of witnesses before parliamentary committee inquiries. There are general provisions as you, Mr Speaker, would be aware under the privileges legislation and also what one might call the common law obligation upon this House and upon the Senate to protect people from interference and to protect witnesses in giving evidence. One of those is the subject of a resolution that was agreed to by another chamber. Under the heading `Molestation of witnesses', it is couched in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. A person shall not inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive of any benefit, another person on account of any evidence given or to be given before the Senate or a committee.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very clear case where a penalty has been imposed. It is obvious that the minister was going to appoint Mr Boland to the position, and I can inform the House that I have spoken to Mr Boland about this matter and he confirms the substance of the article written by Pamela Williams. There is no doubt that he was dumped by the minister because he had the honesty, perhaps the temerity, to actually give his bona fide view before the Senate committee and for his pains, despite his vast experience, he was given the flick by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those opposite may wonder why I raise it here. One of the reasons I raise it here is that I put it to the parliament that this House has a clear duty, and its Committee of Privileges has a clear responsibility to investigate this kind of conduct by a member of this House. But there is another even more compelling reason: this government has made it abundantly clear that under no circumstances will it submit itself in the person of its senior members in any way to the jurisdiction of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those opposite who might say that this is just a matter for the Senate, I say that it is obviously a matter for the Senate but it is also a matter for this House, because it concerns the conduct of somebody in this House who has behaved like a thug in dealing with this particular person. I think it is a matter that ought to be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges. I invite you, sir, to investigate my claim that there has been a breach of privilege. It is clearly the case that this man was punished because he had the temerity to give his view and to fulfil his obligations as a witness before the Senate committee. The minister has breached privilege and I think he ought to be investigated. </PARA>

These areas of the law have been the subject of careful examination by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Criminal investigation</EMPHASIS>, and more recently by the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law established by Mr Bowen as Attorney-General and chaired by the Rt.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was indicating that the review committee made recommendations to modernise Commonwealth law and to ensure that both technological advances are taken into account by these laws and the increased awareness of the need for parliament to state clearly the balance considered appropriate between the community interests in effective law enforcement and the maintenance of individual rights and freedoms. To date laws in this area have been contained in numerous Commonwealth statutes, state and territory laws applied by the Judiciary Act, police instructions or general orders and case law. This has led to considerable uncertainty and inaccessibility of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for a comprehensive scheme for obtaining and executing search warrants, including telephone warrants, stopping and searching conveyances, arrest and related matters such as personal searches, taking and destroying fingerprints, holding identification parades and other identification procedures. It sets out the powers and obligations of police when carrying out any of these procedures and spells out the many safeguards that are designed to protect the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the beginning of its development, which can be traced back to the 1975 Australian Law Reform Commission report on criminal investigation, this bill was always going to involve a delicate balancing of about civil liberties and law enforcement efficiency. Therefore, it did not surprise me that following its consideration by a parliamentary committee the need for amendments would arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate amendments, which emerged from the work of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and subsequent discussions with the opposition and the Australian Democrats, have in my view produced well balanced amendments which should be acceptable to this House. I want to convey my thanks for the courteous and intelligent way in which all those involved in the development of the amendments conducted themselves. I believe that the manner in which all members and senators have approached this bill has produced a quality result which will serve Australians well for many years to come. Today I expect this parliament to pass the amendments and in doing so achieve a much needed reform of the law which has eluded governments for at least 18 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key amendments are as follows: insertion of a requirement on the person applying for a warrant to provide details of previous applications for a warrant and the outcome in relation to the same personal premises which are the subject of the application, which is designed to combat forum shopping; extension of the occupier's right to remain present when items taken from premises are examined so as to determine whether they are within the scope of the search warrant, which previously was restricted to electronically stored information; insertion of an entitlement for occupiers to be present where a search warrant is being executed, which was suggested by the Senate standing committee as a measure to reduce the opportunity for planting material; a limitation on the requirement for suspects and witnesses to provide their names and addresses to police. It also proposes that this requirement only apply to indictable offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also contain: inclusion of a provision requiring police to provide receipts for items seized&mdash;currently police do this in accordance with internal procedures but the Senate considered this important enough to be considered in the act; improvement of the provisions relating to children and incapable people. While the bill had safeguards to protect these people, such as the presence of parents and guardians and the requirement for parental/guardian or personal representative's consent, the amendments provide for greater input from the child or incapable person but use the court to protect the child or incapable person where agreement cannot be reached in relation to their participation in a procedure such as a strip search, the taking of identification material like fingerprints, or participation in an identification parade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are necessarily involved, given variations on the types of procedures and the circumstances, for instance where the child is a suspect or victim. The amendments arose as a result of the submission from the National Children's and Youth Law Centre to the Senate standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also remove a provision which provided that where a suspect refused to participate in an identification parade the court or jury might draw such inferences from that refusal as appear proper. The amended provision states that the common law position will apply with respect to this matter. Under the common law there can be no inference drawn as to the guilt of a person from refusal, but evidence of the refusal may be given to demonstrate why the prosecution used alternative means of identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a requirement that a legal representative of a person be present at the time the decision is made as to whether the suspect will take part in an identification parade. Previously, the bill provided that the presence of such persons was required during the holding of the parade. The protection given by their presence is needed earlier when the decision to participate is made. The decision to refuse could have adverse consequences for the defence case as it could lead to the use of alternative, less satisfactory methods of identification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also include additional notifications to ensure that those having dealings with the police under the legislation are fully informed of their rights and provide for the specific exclusion of the application of state and territory forensic samples legislation where it relates to the taking of identification material. For ease of understanding, I present a revised explanatory memorandum which incorporates the various amendments, and I commend the amendments to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill in the second reading debate I indicated that, in principle, the codification of powers and safeguards relating to the search, arrest and other matters in the investigation of most Commonwealth offences in the bill had much to commend it. I indicated, however, that it appeared to be desirable that the detail of the bill be given further consideration with an opportunity for public input. At that time, I moved that the bill be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular concern at that time was the absence of comment from interested groups. This arose, I suggested, because of the time of the introduction of the bill, which was just prior to the House rising for the Christmas-New Year vacation and when the focus of the House was almost entirely on the debate on the Native Title Bill. The second reading debate took place on the first day of return, on 1 February 1994. I pointed out that many volunteer groups do not function during the Christmas-New Year holiday period and that volunteer groups have the greatest input in terms of community interest on a bill of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion received some support from the government side in that the chairman of the House committee, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), earnestly implored the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) to seriously consider the motion. Unfortunately, the minister did not accede to the motion and, on the basis of the government numbers, the matter went to the Senate without being referred to the House committee for review. At the time, coalition members indicated that, if the matter were not referred to a House committee, it would be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In due course, that occurred. The various amendments which the minister is now so pleased to support were passed as a result of a process which could have occurred in this House but which occurred in the face of government opposition in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of interest in the provisions of the bill can be seen from the report of the Senate standing committee. Nine written submissions were received from a variety of bodies, including the Law Council of Australia, law societies, civil libertarian organisations in more than one state, individual legal practitioners and others interested in, for example, youth affairs. Seven witnesses gave oral evidence to the Senate committee, only two of whom had provided written submissions. The committee delivered a 19-page report dealing with a wide variety of criticisms of the provisions of the bill, and appended to the bill is an extensive letter from the minister in which he dealt with criticisms under approximately 30 headings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that this vindicates the position taken by the coalition. It is unfortunate that the reference of bills to committees of this House has almost never occurred. I hope that the action of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), in agreeing to refer the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, is a precedent which will be followed in many appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The members of the House standing committees represent a significant resource of experience and talent particularly in the case of a bill of which the one under debate is an example. A bill can be significantly improved by detailed consideration in a committee. The opportunity for community input in similarly appropriate cases is also of great value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that have been returned from the Senate are not opposed by the coalition. They were agreed to in the Senate. The amendments, in the main, address civil libertarian concerns along with provisions of the original version of the bill. The amendments make a variety of changes, protecting the rights and interests of persons who are subject to the powers of investigation, search and arrest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One point to be noted for the purpose of the record in this House is that Senator Bolkus gave an undertaking on behalf of the government in the Senate committee debate in relation to an amendment that was proposed by Senator Spindler and later withdrawn following the undertaking. The amendment was to the effect that a notice detailing information and rights would be provided to the occupier of premises entered pursuant to a warrant. The amendment was withdrawn when the minister undertook that the form of warrant to be used and given to an occupier will enumerate the rights contained in the amendment. The amendments required that the notice provide such information as the name of the issuing officer, the address of the premises and a clear statement of the occupier's rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This House has important functions to perform in the scrutiny of legislation.

<PARA>The minister refused to accept our position that this matter should be either left to lie on the table or referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) pointed out, the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) supported our suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government makes a very great play of criticising the Senate, at times even seeking to abolish it. I am mindful of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has referred to senators as `unrepresentative swill' and as `pansies'. The effect of the minister's refusal to accept the recommendation that this matter be sent to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is that the equivalent Senate committee has had to do our job for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Tangney has said, there were nine written submissions to the Senate committee. Oral evidence was taken and a 19-page report was handed down. An ounce of prevention is better than a ton of cure. This debate is quite unnecessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to take up the time of the House for very long. Obviously, the coalition's stance on this issue has been vindicated by the government's accepting a large number of the amendments of both the coalition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. I did speak on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill on 1 February. I spoke about some concerns I had with the bill, such as proposed section 3E(2), which gives police the power to seek a search warrant to search an individual person; proposed section 3U, which creates an offence of failure to supply a name and address; and proposed section 3ZA, which gives police the power to enter premises without a warrant to arrest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth noting that, had the government accepted the advice of the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) and referred the matter to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, some of the time that has been wasted on this bill could have been averted and some of the work of the Senate, which is inundated with referrals with respect to legislation, could also have been saved. The Senate obtained a referral and, as we know, it has made significant amendments to the bill which have been accepted by the government. The government should be congratulated on making that decision and not stringing out the matter any longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's stance was vindicated right from the beginning. The honourable member for Tangney had discussions with the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) about our concerns. Obviously, the government shared some of those concerns.

It would have saved us all from standing up, as we are, and saying to the government, `I told you so.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is a very rarely used body. I understand that almost no referrals have been sent to that committee for many years. I believe that it is an under-used resource which could be better used. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is also a supporter of that position. He said that when he spoke on this bill in the House. If the government listened to the left of its party more often, I think it would be better off. I notice that the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) is agreeing with that position. He is obviously in that faction. I am delighted that he is supporting his colleague the honourable member for Banks. I am sure that he will be pleased to hear about that. In conclusion, I believe that in future the government should take the advice of the honourable member for Tangney, the honourable member for Banks and perhaps the left of its party on some of its legal issues. </PARA>

The addition results from agreements between parties wishing to access the land and its resources.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the act came into operation in 1977, a total of 57 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the act. The most recent additions occurred in May 1993. This additional parcel of land proposed in the bill consists of an area of 1,238 square kilometres in the Wave Hill locality of the Northern Territory, to the far north of Tennant Creek. The inclusion follows agreement between the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and a company called Gambamora Industries Ltd to settle a standard claim over the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that the land was the subject of a much larger land claim east of the Wampana area. However, that land claim failed and, pursuant to the land rights legislation, a repeat claim was made for a smaller area. The area is dry, arid, vacant crown land and, due to its limited commercial value and remoteness, has never been the subject of a pastoral lease and obviously it is very appropriate in terms of Aboriginal land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were concerns on the part of the adjoining landowner, Gambamora Pty Ltd, which owned the Cattle Creek station, regarding fencing erected which appeared to encroach on the land that was the subject of the claim. Before the hearing before the Aboriginal Lands Commissioner had concluded, the parties reached agreement and concessions were made in relation to the fencing and a number of other issues. As a result of that agreement, the Northern Territory government agreed to request the Commonwealth to grant the claim area to the traditional owners by scheduling the area under the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Northern Territory government, which perhaps has a reputation that some would consider to be negative in this respect, has made it very clear that it wants this land scheduled. It has made it very clear that territory policy is to settle as many land claims as possible by negotiation. That, of course, has applied in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not oppose this legislation. But, before I close my comments, I want to make a couple of other observations that I would like to commend to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner). It seems to me that this is a good example whereby commonsense and some cooperation and talking can actually have a positive outcome for all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government often articulates in its public statements that it wants cooperation and bipartisanship; yet I would have to say that all too often recently that has not been the action it has performed, only the rhetoric it has followed. For example, there were many calls last year during consideration of the native title legislation for a bipartisan approach. Yet, as I have said in this place before, on two separate occasions last year approaches by me to the government to try to sort out some common ground were rebuffed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week we had the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs issuing press statements calling for a bipartisan approach on the land acquisition fund. I have to tell the House that, in spite of approaches there, we have had no information, no debate and no discussions&mdash;only a lot of public statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast that to the time when the previous Prime Minister was in the chair when the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation was set up. When informal approaches took place, the issue was debated, there was an opportunity from my side of politics to consult with state colleagues around the country and, after some negotiation, a common position was agreed and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation legislation was introduced and passed without difficulty. It seems to me that there we have a good example of the substance of how a cooperative and constructive system can work for the benefit of all, compared with the crash or crash through approach adopted under the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about looking at bipartisanship or cooperative affairs, then it seems to me that we need more than rhetoric: we need some constructive action. I commend to the minister that the action that has taken place with the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council and the commercial interest concerned has been very constructive. Perhaps this government should learn  the same lessons on some of the bigger issues that come before this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill. As the previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent), has outlined, the intention of this amendment bill is to enable the incorporation of an additional land claim area under the schedule of the act. It is supported by the Northern Territory government, the Central Land Council, the Commonwealth government and, as we have just heard, by the opposition. Therefore, this bill and the debate surrounding it is basically a simple and non-controversial matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents a very significant achievement for the people involved in this land and one about which we should be very pleased. The people involved are very pleased because this bill has resolved a longstanding claim they have had to this land and it will enable the transfer of this land to them. As the honourable member for Aston said, the process of negotiation that was undertaken to resolve this matter was a very good one which involved conciliation on all sides and a willingness to negotiate and to act reasonably. The differences of opinion that were occurring over the boundary claims were resolved amicably, to the satisfaction of both the cattle station owners&mdash;cattle creek station&mdash;and the Aboriginal people. The settlement contains significant benefits not only for the pastoralists involved but also for the Aboriginal people, the Northern Territory government and the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Aston, in his concluding remarks, commented on the fact that there was a failure to achieve bipartisanship on the very significant native title legislation that this House and the Senate debated last year. He indicated that, in meetings with the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), he had attempted to achieve some level of bipartisanship. He seemed to make the accusation that it is somehow the government's fault that the plea for bipartisanship and for cooperation in that legislation failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member failed to indicate that his position during that debate was being undermined by his own colleagues. He failed to recognise or to record in this House the fact that the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) and a number of members of the other place were making very strong speeches anti to the Mabo legislation and the achievement of native title. Despite his personal desire to achieve bipartisanship, which I think was quite correct&mdash;I know the honourable member for Aston and his position on these issues&mdash;he was not able to achieve bipartisanship. That was not due to any failure on the part of the government but due to a failure of will on the part of his colleagues on his side of the House. He should be very careful about making accusations about this government and its failure to achieve bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 11 years in which we have been in government we have continuously striven to have that as the hallmark of our administration of Aboriginal affairs. During the current minister's period of office, in any debate about Aboriginal welfare or Aboriginal needs, it has been his desire to cooperate with the members of the coalition on all occasions and to achieve an outcome satisfactory to all sides. It was not through our weaknesses or our failings that we were not able to achieve that outcome on native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the coalition lost the election it did not believe it was possible to lose, it decided to adopt an oppositionist position on every issue. That was the position it took on native title. Those in the coalition were the ones who changed their position. When the High Court brought down its decision in 1992 the coalition had a very good position. It was expressing a desire to cooperate and work with the government, and we were pleased to have that happen. The coalition changed its position after the election. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) changed his position and came out very strongly against the government's desire to introduce Commonwealth legislation on native title. The positions being taken by members such as the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Flinders undermined any possibility of bipartisanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill is a very good example&mdash;an effective example&mdash;of almost 20 years of bipartisan administration of Aboriginal land rights. The legislation, although passed by the Fraser government in 1976, originated with the Woodward Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. Justice Woodward was appointed by the Labor government in 1973 to inquire into the appropriate means to recognise and establish the traditional rights and interests of the Aborigines in and in relation to land and to satisfy in other ways the reasonable aspirations of the Aborigines to rights in or in relation to land. This legislation came about as a result of the findings of that commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the legislation was born because of a Whitlam Labor government initiative. It was produced by a Liberal government and administered for its first six years by a Liberal government and for the last 11 years by a Labor government. Throughout that period it has received bipartisan support in this House, as will this amendment now. I think that is a significant point to make. It is a pity that the achievement of bipartisan support on this bill was not extended to the other important land rights legislation that this House has debated this century&mdash;the native title legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members of some of the things said in 1976 when the bill was first introduced that recognised the importance of a bipartisan position on Aboriginal affairs. In the debate in the Senate in December 1976 Senator Chaney had this to say about this legislation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Woodward commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">report was put down the then government very quickly advised that it accepted the report in principle and the leaders of the National Country Party of Australia and the Liberal Party of Australia in the Parliament also indicated very quickly that they, too, intended to support the general thrust of the Woodward report.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since Mr Justice Woodward's report there has been basically no real argument in Australia against the establishment of Aboriginal land rights.</PARA>
<PARA>That applied up until 1993 when an argument emerged during the native title legislation, the opposition changing from the position of principle it had held for almost 17 years to the position of opposition it adopted to the Mabo legislation. It is also important to recognise that the first and only Aboriginal parliamentarian in federal parliament, Liberal Senator Neville Bonner, moved the following motion which was adopted unanimously in 1976:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very interesting to note that that motion&mdash;moved by a Liberal senator and supported by the then opposition, the Labor Party&mdash;was carried unanimously in the Senate in 1976. That was the principled position of the Senate in 1976. What a contrast there is between that principled position that was supported unanimously then to the position taken by the opposition in 1993 of total opposition to the Mabo legislation. I am pleased that, with regard to this current legislation before the House, the opposition has understood that it is crucial to have bipartisan support for Aboriginal issues, for Aboriginal welfare and for the advancement of Aboriginal people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the other point that has been dominating political debate in the last few days. It is also very crucial to the question of Aboriginal welfare and opportunities for advancement. In the last few days we have had a lot of chest beating by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and other members of the opposition as to the intentions of the government towards improving its expenditure on Aboriginal health and other programs to advance the conditions of Aboriginal people. This debate has been trying to predict what might be in the budget to be brought down on 10 May. It has been a very interesting debate. The Leader of the Opposition has been attacking and criticising the government because we are to increase the allocation to Aboriginal health by only some $500 million over the next five years. He says it is a disgraceful situation that we are to increase the amount of money by only about $500 million. We have on record the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. He held a doorstop interview on 27 April 1994 in which he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you'd like to see more spent?</PARA>
<PARA>And he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We obviously want to see more spent. We've supported the reconciliation process provided it focuses on dealing with Aboriginal disadvantage. And it's not just in the area of health, it's in the area of education, job opportunities, housing and so on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly do not disagree with it; it is the hypocrisy behind it that I am concerned with. Later that same day, on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program, the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Look, our policy and our support for the process of reconciliation to be specific, is on the basis that we do something about improving the obvious Aboriginal disadvantage and I've listed the main areas, health, education, housing, employment opportunities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>et cetera. The fact is he is attacking the government for outlining its intention, which will be contained in the next budget, to increase by some $500 million the allocation that it is making to Aboriginal health, housing and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is the actual coalition policy on this matter? Those opposite do not have any written policies at the moment, so it is very hard to find out exactly where they stand. But if we go back to their policy which they took to the people of Australia some 12 months ago, that gives us a fairly clear indication of where the coalition really stands with regard to Aboriginal health. It shows the total hypocrisy that we have listened to from the Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members of the opposition when they start claiming that somehow they are the saviours of Aboriginal people and that, if they were in power, they would be doing a lot more for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at what they intended to do should we now be faced with the sorry state of their being on this side of the House occupying the Treasury benches. From their policy document, I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition proposes to cut spending on Aboriginal programs by $90 million&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is in a year. That would have meant a cut over five years of $450 million. I contrast that with what we are intending to do which is, I believe&mdash;although we will have to wait until the budget is delivered to find out&mdash;an increase in expenditure of some $500 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where would the coalition have made its cuts? We have had the Leader of the Opposition crying crocodile tears about how he would have increased money on education, housing, employment opportunities and health for Aboriginal people. These are the cuts that the coalition would have made: a cut of $25 million a year from the Aboriginal housing fund; a cut of $21 million in Aboriginal education and employment programs; a cut of $20 million in the community development employment program, the CDEP. Then there is a whole list of other cuts which the coalition would have made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That puts on record the true position of what the coalition would have done if it had been in charge of Aboriginal affairs. So let us not have any more chest beating and hypocrisy from the Leader of the Opposition about how the coalition would be looking after Aboriginal people. It is only this government, a Labor government, that is truly committed to trying to address the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in this country. That will be demonstrated further by our commitment to increased expenditure in the budget when it is brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) on 10 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to speak on this legislation. It is another landmark piece of legislation for the government in ensuring continued justice for Aboriginal people. I am pleased that the people involved in the Wave Hill district of the Northern Territory will now be able to get access to their land which has been denied them for so long.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill adds an area of some 1,238 square kilometres in the Wave Hill area to the parcels of land granted to Aboriginal land councils in the Northern Territory. In this instance, the land concerned is described as arid vacant crown land which has never been the subject of a pastoral lease and which is of limited commercial value. The Northern Territory government has agreed to the grant of the area to those claiming to be its traditional owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so doing, this legislation will add to the 48 per cent of the Northern Territory which is already inalienably controlled by the Aboriginal communities. While this particular land transfer may be relatively uncontroversial, the Aboriginal land rights issue is causing major concern, particularly in rural and regional parts of Australia. Unfortunately, much of the debate is being conducted in an emotional atmosphere of ignorance, and many of the arguments are being based on little better than academic theory, wishful thinking and stupid name-calling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's entire Aboriginal affairs policy seems to be built around the granting of large areas of land to various Aboriginal groups. Land rights is not a magic wand which will solve the social and economic problems of Australian Aborigines. There is no evidence that the granting of land title has provided any improvement in the living conditions and lifestyle of the new landowners. Indeed, in most instances their circumstances seem to have become even worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the Aboriginal communities where social degradation and disgraceful living standards are at their worst have been owned by the Aboriginal people already for a couple of decades. A visit to many of these areas would make most Australians ashamed. Buildings, housing and facilities have been destroyed. Education and other services have been hampered or stalled. Alcoholism and violence are the norm. Family relationships and social discipline are in tatters, and there is no hope or planning for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcomed the reports following the visit by the former health minister, former Senator Richardson, to the Northern Territory when he committed the government to an extra $800 million for Aboriginal health care. Throwing money at problems does not correct the wrongs, but there is an urgent need to address Aboriginal health issues. Now, it seems, the government has decided to slash that expenditure increase, but apparently there will still be money available for the new Aboriginal land fund. The purchase of extra areas of land will not help cure alcoholism, will not stem the spread of AIDS, and will not extend Aboriginal life expectancy or improve their state of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the number of Aboriginal deaths in custody. The most telling information to come from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody was the fact that Aborigines are not more likely to commit suicide in custody than other Australians. So many of them die in custody because they are heavily overrepresented in the prison population. They are in gaol not because of racist police or magistrates but because they commit more crime and more serious and violent crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's own report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's health</EMPHASIS>, found that Aboriginal men and women lived on average 17 years less than the non-Aboriginal population. Infant mortality is four times higher than among the non-Aboriginal population. Aborigines smoke more, drink more, and have much greater rates of malnutrition and higher rates of a wide range of diseases. They are in hospital two or three times more often than the rest of the population. They are also more likely to be killed in car accidents or to be victims of violent crime, almost always inflicted by members of their own race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These appalling statistics occur in spite of all the land grants that have been provided over recent years. Indeed, many of the worst locations of degradation, appalling lifestyle and violent conduct are in communities where Aborigines have had title to the land for considerable periods. Land rights has become a part of the Aboriginal industry rhetoric, along with words like `sacred sites', `dispossession' and `racism'. None of these words adequately justify the crisis confronting Australia in its dealings with the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arrival of a white man six generations ago is no excuse for gangs of young Aboriginal youths to bash one another or smash up a town. It is not racism which denies opportunities to Aboriginal people. Indeed, there is much criticism in the community about the large number of special programs available only to Aborigines or to those who claim to be Aborigines. Obtaining title to land perhaps a thousand miles from where they have lived for perhaps several generations will do nothing to solve the problems of despair and hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has a clear responsibility to its Aboriginal people to ensure that their standard of living is improved and that they enjoy equal opportunities with their fellow Australians. This obligation means that special programs and special opportunities funded by other Australians may be necessary to address their disadvantage. However, the sooner we move to a situation where rights are available equally to all Australians irrespective of their race, where welfare is provided on the basis of need&mdash;not on race&mdash;where one law and one set of standards applies to all, the sooner our country will have a harmonious, progressive and non-racist multicultural society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not good enough for anyone who makes comments that do not exactly fit the politically correct agenda of the Aboriginal industry to be immediately branded a racist. Indeed, such criticism could be most fairly directed against those who advocate special laws and special land titles purely on the basis of race. It is not racist to expect an Aboriginal company to pay its bills as one would any other Australian company. Indeed, it would be racist to suggest anything else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was horrified by a judge who allowed an Aborigine found guilty of attempting to kill his de facto wife to go unpunished, and by his telling the man that had he not been an Aborigine he would have gone to gaol for years. It is not acceptable to allow hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to be unaccounted for, just because it is spent in Aboriginal communities. We must confront these issues, not merely attempt to dismiss those who draw attention to the current problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key to a better future for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders is meaningful employment and an opportunity to contribute to the country and raise self-esteem. Perhaps one of the best and most successful programs introduced to assist Aborigines is the community development program. This scheme has provided work opportunities for thousands of Aborigines within their own communities as a substitute for dole payments. The scheme is highly regarded amongst Aboriginal communities which have seen the tremendous benefits of the program. People who were once idle are obtaining fulfilment from doing useful tasks while the community itself has benefited from improved facilities, better maintenance and the development of a constructive attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community development program may not suit some of the social engineers in Canberra because it involves putting in some effort in return for the receipt of unemployment benefits, but the scheme has been a success and, frankly, should be extended to non-Aborigines right across the country. I am alarmed that the government is planning to cut funding for the community development program and reduce the number of places available. The Labor government, which cannot find adequate funding for Aboriginal health, proposes to cut the community development program. At the same time, it has committed billions of dollars to land acquisitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one speaks to Aborigines privately and away from their white advisers, one will find that very few believe that their problems will be resolved by further land acquisition. After all, Aborigines already have on average eight times more land than other Australians. Most Aborigines are voting with their feet and choosing not to live on the areas of land that have already been provided. Aborigines, like other Australians, prefer McDonalds to kangaroo stew. They want a choice of television channels and access to the services and facilities of a western lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only rarely is the land provided put to productive use. Occasionally great publicity is given to what appear to be successful cattle stations, new crocodile farms and tourist developments on Aboriginal property, but far too often it is not long before the cattle are wandering over the whole district, the crocodiles have escaped and the tourist development is closed through lack of custom&mdash;more millions of taxpayers' money just lost and never accounted for. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reported recently on large grants being made to communities where no-one lives, with extensive buildings and motor vehicles provided just left abandoned. Greater land holdings are not the key to an improved lifestyle for Aborigines or to better understanding and goodwill between black and white. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor's Aboriginal affairs strategy has not, though, failed just Aborigines. The current Mabo land rights crisis represents the biggest threat to the sovereignty and economic future of Australia outside of wartime. The fallout from the extraordinary High Court decision has already severely damaged investor confidence and placed security of land title in doubt right across the nation. Overseas investors, who once would have looked at Australia for mineral, tourism and other developments, are already going to other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever Australians travel overseas and talk with members of the business community, the first thing on the agenda is always Mabo. I was in Hong Kong just a few months ago and the story was exactly the same. All the questions from the business community were about Mabo and its potential effects on their investments. Even Australian mining companies which had been established here for years are now seeking to explore in South America, New Guinea and even Europe because of their lack of investment confidence in their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of Mabo in economic terms has already been substantial and there will undoubtedly be many greater problems ahead. But it is affecting not just big companies and big developments but also ordinary Australians. Queensland is perhaps the only state with any kind of matching Mabo legislation at the present time, and there is already plenty of evidence in the state of Queensland about what life is going to be like after Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own electorate of Wide Bay, the Gympie Bridge Club has been forced to cancel or defer its new hall building project because of potential Mabo style claims over the site, which is currently a crown reserve. The Gympie show pavilion is in doubt because it is on crown land which could some day be claimed by Aborigines. Even the Cherbourg Aboriginal community, which has had title to its own land for years, has had to stop building much needed houses for the community because of the likelihood of claims by other Aboriginal groups. There are problems with banks being unwilling to lend funds for projects&mdash;even new factories on crown industrial estates&mdash;because of concern about potential Aboriginal land claims. Councils have been unable to open roads on reserves because there may be a claim by an Aboriginal group at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is not just miners, tourist operators and pastoralists who face uncertainty with this legislation. Sporting and community groups, factories and other organisations operating on crown land, including reserves and leasehold estates, face particular difficulties in the future as a result of the combination of the federal and Queensland Labor governments' Mabo legislation. Any groups with future development proposals are possibly going to be delayed at the whim of Aboriginal claimants, many of whom may never have seen the land involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Goss has given all sorts of assurances to the people of the Wide Bay electorate that they will be unaffected by land claims that have already been made over large parts of the electorate. A gentleman by the name of Mr John Jones&mdash;a classic member of the Aboriginal industry who had not been seen in the area prior to the Fitzgerald inquiry and prior to suggestions that there might be land available&mdash;has now lodged claims over vast areas of Fraser Island, the Great Sandy region and surrounding city and urban areas, together with a bill for compensation for hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Premier Goss has dismissed these claims as frivolous and as having no chance of success. But when the state government attempted to have these claims struck out in the courts in Queensland the judge refused the application. Premier Goss says that these claims are frivolous but they are still hanging over the heads of all the land-holders, whether they be in possession of leasehold, freehold, or any other type of title. This particular gentleman, Mr Jones, claims to be an elder of three separate tribes&mdash;not a bad effort, I would have thought, for a single Aborigine. His links with the local community are at best very tenuous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, those claims are in place. No doubt it will take many months&mdash;perhaps years&mdash;to dispose of those claims. Those claims are going to be prosecuted with the benefit of taxpayers' funds through the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service. Those sorts of funds are not available to land-holders who may have to defend their own title which has perhaps been in the possession of their families for four or five generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not enough for premiers and prime ministers to say that these claims are fictitious. Already, the very existence of those claims is delaying projects, preventing development and driving away potential investors in this area and, indeed, in other parts of our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the High Court was extraordinary in many ways. But it is even more extraordinary that the Prime Minister, in attempting to make a mark for himself as a Whitlam style provider of social change, extended the findings of the Mabo inquiry to cover such a large area of our country. After all, the Mabo decision was about a small Melanesian community that has cultivated a particular parcel of land on an island in the Torres Strait that had never been used for any other purpose. It has now been extended to enable people claiming to be Aborigines to make claims over the whole of continental Australia. I know they have said that they will not claim Sydney, Melbourne or some other areas. But it is no more ridiculous to claim the main street of Sydney or Melbourne than it is to claim a grazing property held by a family for four or five generations. So there are these concerns right across the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the existence of this appallingly complicated Mabo legislation that lawyers are unable to understand, whose full intent no-one knows. It is also the fact that, at the same time as this legislation is going through the parliament, Australia is participating in the development of the Universal Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, a proposed new United Nations treaty which, if it comes into fruition, will grant rights of self-determination and self-government to indigenous peoples around the world. The Australian government will be responding to this draft covenant by July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be remembered that if this treaty were to come to fruition Aborigines and other indigenous peoples around the world would be granted rights to self-government within their own continent. They would have the right under articles 3 and 4 of the declaration to opt out of any state or any part of it. Article 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development.</PARA>

<PARA>Article 32 talks about establishing their own citizenship. Article 33 gives indigenous people the right to have their own distinctive judicial customs and traditions, their own judicial systems. Other articles talk about power sharing in various different levels of government.</PARA>

Is it any wonder that investors are looking at Australia with concern? Not only have vast parts of the continent already been handed over to less than two per cent of the population, but the signing of this particular treaty will mean that those areas will have the capacity to self-govern their own affairs irrespective of the needs of other Australians with whom they share this continent. Land rights of themselves will do nothing to cure the many ills confronting the Aboriginal population. It would be far better for the government to maintain its commitment to health and other matters, rather than these things. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a member of a parliamentary committee which is concerned about the alienation, the dispossession, the deprivation, the devastation of a race of people as a result of European settlement in Australia. That process has taken place over the past 200 years when the Aboriginal races had occupied this country for 60,000 years, possibly longer, before the Europeans arrived here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wide Bay, while acknowledging some of the serious social, health and economic disabilities suffered by Aboriginal people, then set out to decry any of the measures which have been adopted in an attempt to redress some of those disabilities. He referred, for example, to our obligation to improve the standard of living of Aborigines and create equality with other Australians. But apart from mouthing a few cliches and slogans, the whole of his speech was intent on diminishing the nature of Aboriginal Australians and decrying all the measures that have been attempted aimed at redressing some of those past wrongs. </PARA>

I ask the honourable member to give me one quotation showing where anybody in support of the Aboriginal land rights and land title legislation has ever suggested that all of those problems resulting from the dispossession of those people from land that they had occupied for at least 60,000 years would be overcome in that way only. He then said that the problem would not be solved by throwing money at the problem. Again nobody ever claimed that it would. It is a question of the adequacy of a whole complex of integrated, coordinated, effective and sensible programs to make it possible for some of those questions to be resolved and some of the past wrongs to be redressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to one comment made by the honourable member for Wide Bay which serves to discredit absolutely his whole approach to the question and by other people who make the same sorts of comments. He said that Aborigines in Australia had eight times more land than other Australians, but he just left the statement there&mdash;full stop. He must know that has been the case because nobody else wants it. The Aborigines were dispossessed of any reasonable land in Australia. That certainly refers to decent hunting grounds, apart from land occupied by Aborigines out in the deserts and in the dry and tropical areas of the north. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, if the land were suitable for grazing it would have been taken up under freehold or leasehold. If suitable for mining, the land is under leasehold. If suitable for urban development it is used for housing and other types of commercial development. Therefore, for the member to say that Aborigines have eight times more land than other Australians with the implications that lie behind that bland statement, finishing with a full stop at the end of it, shows the motives of the member for Wide Bay and those other people who mouth similar types of comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then went on to comment that Mabo represents the greatest threat to the security of Australia outside wartime. I thought that everybody now accepted the fact that Mabo represents nothing more than a recognition of the fact that terra nullius was false right from the start of European settlement. To suggest that Australia had not been occupied by any people earlier than 200 years ago was a falsity of monstrous dimensions. Terra nullius was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Wide Bay that Aboriginal Australians before 200 years ago are now acknowledged to have occupied the whole of Australia. It is not our role to redress the injustices of history. A lot of those events were accidents of history. They were circumstances which occurred in the total historic panorama of world development and the spread of civilisations over areas which had been occupied by people who did not have access to the same types of technological developments and innovations which were taking place in Western Europe, North America and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To claim, as the honourable member must imply by the comments he made, that terra nullius was a correct assessment of Australia's circumstances at that time is surprising, to say the least. It was not so very long ago, in 1976, that an important and relevant motion was adopted unanimously in the Senate, not only by members of the Liberal Party, including the then Senator Bonner, the only Aboriginal to have sat in this parliament, and by members of the Labor Party, who were then in opposition, but also by members of the National Party. The Senate adopted that resolution unanimously. Every member of the Senate, from every political party in the Senate, adopted that resolution unanimously. Let me read what it said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior to the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay, urges the Australian Government to admit prior ownership by the said indigenous people and introduce legislation to compensate the people now known as Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders for dispossession of their land.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every member of the National Party in 1976, together with every other member of the Senate, endorsed that motion. Was that just a sop to the only Aboriginal that ever sat in this parliament? Was that just a gratuitous act on the part of his Senate colleagues and his party colleagues in 1976, almost 20 years ago? Or was that a genuine response from members of the National Party at that time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We indicate the very positive and creditable&mdash;certainly courageous and moral&mdash;approach which has been taken by the Australian Labor Party in government and in opposition in pursuing many of these questions. But we do not claim that only the Labor Party has been responsible for any of the improvements which have taken place. It would not be correct for us to do that; we do not do that.

Everyone knows Peter Baume is now the Professor of Community Medicine at Sydney University. He was a genuine liberal and a good, honest and honourable man.

In desperation, frustration and disillusionment Senator Peter Baume left the Senate and took an academic appointment in an area where he could more directly and more personally bring to bear for the benefit of people all of those great personal talents that he has.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is this: that parcel of land is in the Wave Hill area. `Wave Hill' is a very proud name in the history of the Aboriginal land rights movement. The land that we are dealing with at present is in the same general area as the land that was claimed by the Gurindjis in the 1960s. But the claimants for this land are the Wampana people, not the Gurindjis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proud, determined and courageous fighters at Wave Hill in the 1960s and the 1970s were successful in what they set out to achieve. They were nobly assisted by the late Frank Hardy and they were victorious as a result of the support that Gough Whitlam gave them. On another occasion, I said that I hoped no Australian would ever forget the magnificent symbolism of the occasion when Gough Whitlam, as Prime Minister, went to Wattie Creek, Wave Hill, and ceremoniously poured the land back into the hands of the Gurindjis. It was a magnificent, symbolic gesture. So the struggle proceeds. </PARA>

In my previous working life before entering parliament, I worked as a policy adviser for the Central Land Council, whose responsibility it was to administer and run this claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A range of issues have entered this debate thus far. I plan to canvass some of them. But I think we need to put this debate into some sort of historical context&mdash;not so much because of the land it deals with or the fact that a fortunate group of people have been able to acquire, through agreement, a piece of their own country back, but in order to recall that this land grant is exercised under the Northern Territory land rights act and to recall what that act means to Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. We should also contemplate the opposition that there has been, and continues to be, to that act&mdash;and the rights that the act gives Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory&mdash;and the sources whence that opposition comes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other historical context which I think is relevant, bearing in mind the nature of the debate, is the historic events in South Africa. Over recent months we have seen a vigorous, sometimes violent, debate around issues of race. Over the last three or four days we have seen the successful culmination of a campaign waged against the concept of apartheid and against issues of racism, in the form of the election through democratic processes of an African government properly representing the interests of the people of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this matter to see the parallel contexts between a debate in South Africa which is about issues of racism and which has culminated in the election of a government in South Africa which truly represents the interests of the whole community and this legislation which, in the first instance, when it was introduced in 1976, was designed to represent the first step&mdash;in fact, the only step at the time&mdash;to come to terms with the historical reality of the dispossession and alienation of Aboriginal people from their country. It was done in the Northern Territory&mdash;fortunately, from my point of view&mdash;because that was an area which was subject to the Commonwealth parliament and because that was where the demand was greatest. It was there that Woodward had his royal commission and made the recommendations which formed the basis of the legislation which was ultimately passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents to that legislation have been vociferous and many. They have embarked upon a consistent campaign to denigrate the importance of land rights and the land rights act, often to denigrate those people who are going to benefit from that act, and to denigrate those non-Aboriginal people who supported them. We have seen campaigns waged against these people, whether they are non-Aboriginal or Aboriginal, because at various times they have been seen, by vested interests&mdash;principally in the Northern Territory&mdash;as somehow stealing the birthright of territorians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an obvious contradiction and a certain amount of hypocrisy in that statement. Who ultimately are these territorians, bearing in mind that the most territorian of territorians, in any event, must be those people who were alienated and dispossessed of their land? They are Aboriginal territorians. But often in these debates, for some reason, Aboriginal territorians are not regarded as territorians; they are regarded as `them' or `other'&mdash;some other classification of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the campaigns which have been waged successfully over the years by the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, the partners in crime to the National Party of Australia, principally, and to the Liberal Party of Australia&mdash;and the CLP senator from the Northern Territory who sits with the National Party in the Senate&mdash;they have consistently waged what often have been overtly racist campaigns against the interests and rights of Aboriginal people as they have been expounded under the Northern Territory land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what the corporate memory in this parliament is like of those debates, but it is worth contemplating when those debates took place and where we are currently in the recognition of those legitimate rights which Aboriginal people were afforded under the land rights act. In the context of elections, I cannot think of one occasion since self-government in 1978 in which the Northern Territory CLP has not, either directly or indirectly, run a campaign based on division and on race, subtly at times but more overtly at other times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most pronounced Northern Territory election campaign was in 1983. I refer to the 1983 Northern Territory election campaign because it provides a very interesting example of the psyche of these people who oppose land rights. In this instance, the CLP consistently opposed Aboriginal people being provided with land rights and all of the accompanying rights that are contained within the land rights act, including a limited right to withhold consent for developments on their land. That, of course, has been the key to all the opposition in a sense, because members of the CLP could not contemplate that Aboriginal people might have a different association with the country which required a different recognition of rights than is accorded to non-Aboriginal Australians. They had no idea of this concept of relationship with country; no understanding of the spirituality which Aboriginal people conceive when they talk about country; no idea of the kinship obligations which confront Aboriginal people when they talk about their country; and no idea of the ceremonial obligations which confront Aboriginal people when they talk about country. None of these things seem to register in the psyche of these people who oppose land rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I often wonder why, but we will come to that in a moment. As I was about to relate, Paul Everingham&mdash;I do not know whether honourable members remember him; he has just been sacked as the Liberal Party President in Queensland&mdash;had a very prestigious career in the federal parliament which lasted about two rounds of the revolving door. He was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in 1983, which was the time the Commonwealth was talking about Ayers Rock. Can members remember this? He spoke of Uluru and the transfer of title of Uluru to the traditional owners under the land rights act and its lease back to the Commonwealth under the provisions of that act to be run as a national park in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think that Uluru and Kakadu have been the two most prescient examples of what lands rights has delivered to this country. Here we have in any sense of the word two of the most important jewels in the cultural tourism crown of this country, managed jointly by the Commonwealth through a management board which comprises a majority of traditional owners or their representatives and the Commonwealth through ANCA, the Australian National Conservation Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us not underestimate the importance of that relationship or what it has meant. It has been done at the behest of the traditional owners who have seen fit to say to the Australian community, `We want you to share with us in a way which suits both us and you.' They have done it in a most appropriate manner. There are very few tourists who come to this country who do not want to see or experience either Kakadu or Uluru.

We haven't moved it across the South Australian border. It is still here.' And of course it is still there. Prior to this campaign by Tuxworth, his political image was on the wane. Like his predecessor, Everingham, he undertook a very cynical, overtly racist campaign to manipulate anti-Aboriginal prejudice within the community for his own political purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CLP has traditionally used divisive, racist campaigns and divisive, emotive themes based on racism as a political weapon against the ALP, which it has offensively described in the past as the Aboriginal Labor Party.

This has not only boosted the Northern Territory economy but also recognised Aboriginals' rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to Everingham, Aboriginal people were manipulated by white advisers and lawyers into believing they were traditional owners. I have to say that nothing has changed; that is still the sort of garbage we get from people within the CLP in some instances. In a cynical inversion of the truth, Tuxworth claimed that the Land Rights Act was inflaming racial tension. Here we have people using a burner&mdash;a blowtorch&mdash;to try to incite racial tension and division in the community against Aboriginal interests by saying that, somehow or other, it is the fault of Aboriginal people.

First, it opposed Mabo, as we would expect from these great bastions in the protection of democracy. Twenty-five per cent of its population is Aboriginal. A large proportion of those people are dispossessed of their country. What country Aboriginal people have been able to get has been unalienable crown land claimed under the land rights act. An even larger proportion of that land was scheduled land, put aside for Aboriginal interests prior to the land rights act and just transferred back to them under unalienable freehold title post the land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very cynical approach is now being adopted by the Northern Territory government in opposing the development of a land fund. It opposes the development of a land fund because it does not want Aboriginal people to buy more land in the Northern Territory. One of the spin-offs of land rights is that Aboriginal people have gained royalties. Also, a significant contribution has been made by the Commonwealth. But eventually Aboriginal people have had money at their disposal to buy properties. Some of them have purchased land and gone through a claims process&mdash;which is their right until 1997&mdash;to transfer those titles under the land rights act to inalienable freehold title. That is opposed by the Northern Territory government, and it has its reasons for that. I do not want to debate the merits or otherwise of its opposition. On 15 April this year the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, in speaking on this debate about land and its acquisition by Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle is you're using taxpayers funds to satisfy those Aborigines who do not have access to land under Native Title or Land Rights legislation. In the Northern Territory we have nearly 50% of the Northern Territory already Aboriginal land or under claim. The balance of the Territory is largely pastoral property. If you provided another 2-3 million dollars in the Northern Territory situation you could probably buy 90% of the Northern Territory and that would mean that 25% of the Territory's population would own nearly all of the Northern Territory . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Can members imagine the Chief Minister of a territory or a premier of a state or the Prime Minister of this country actually saying that there ought to be a limit to the amount of land which is purchased by any class or group of people in their constituency? But the Northern Territory Chief Minister is arguing that, because Aboriginal people comprise 25 per cent of the population and because, through dint of the land rights act, they have been able to claim land&mdash;a lot of it useless land in non-Aboriginal terms; they have been able to purchase land either through appropriations of the Commonwealth or through their own savings, through land trusts or through royalty payments&mdash;somehow or another we should put up a barrier to them purchasing any more land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take honourable members back to the beginning of my contribution when I asked, `Where are we now in 1994 in a context where we have just had an election in South Africa based on expunging racism?' An election is to be called in the Northern Territory some time this year. What I am arguing, I think coherently, is that, if we really want to call this country democratic, if we really want to recognise and have recognised the rights of indigenous Australians, if we really do support the sentiments behind the original legislation, if we as a nation are to come to terms with what it is to be Australian as we approach the year 2000, do we not have to come to terms with this fundamental issue, this contradiction between, on the one hand, the racist arguments&mdash;certainly divisive arguments&mdash;and, on the other hand, the rights of a group of Australians to participate in the Australian economy and to the right of that same group of Australians to have their legitimate interests in their country recognised? What we have instead is a farrago of lies about the way in which the Northern Territory has been disadvantaged by the land rights act and how territorians, whoever they are&mdash;understand that they are not Aboriginal people&mdash;have been disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal people are a very important part of the Northern Territory. They are a very important part of Australia. The net advantage to the Northern Territory and to Australia as a result of this land rights act can never be underestimated. I urge members of the opposition to put pressure on their CLP colleagues in the Northern Territory to at last come to terms with contemporary reality, to at last come to terms with the fact that they have to live and work with Aboriginal Australians in the joint interests of the Northern Territory and Australia as a whole. If they do that, we will go a long way to expunging the stupidity of the divisive campaigns that have been a hallmark of the past.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to enable the adjustment of interest rates applicable to the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme to remove an irregularity. The scheme established under the act provides for a subsidised loan of up to $40,000 to members or ex-members of the Australian Defence Force for a period related to their length of service. The loans are made available by the National Australia Bank. The bank paid a franchise fee to the Commonwealth to provide loans under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsidy to be paid on a loan in any month is equal to 40 per cent of the average monthly interest to be paid over the life of the loan, calculated on a 25-year period at the benchmark interest rate applying for that month. Essentially, the benchmark interest rate is assessed on a month-by-month basis and represents the lower of the rate offered by the National Australia Bank and the average of the rates offered by the five largest Australian banks. The method of calculating the benchmark interest rate is prescribed in subclause 5.15 of the agreement between the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth, contained in schedule 1 to the act. Section 35 of the act prohibits amendment of subclause 5.15. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subclause 5.15 is currently operating in a manner that was not originally envisaged and which is not desired either by the National Australia Bank or the Commonwealth. The irregularity has arisen because special low introductory rates for new loans with interest fixed for a period of 12 months or less were not contemplated when the agreement was drawn up. The present wording of subclause 5.15 applies these introductory rates to all borrowers under the scheme, irrespective of whether they are new borrowers, and for as long as those rates are on public offer. These special introductory rates are significantly lower than the bank's majority interest rate which previously would have applied. For example, from August 1993 to April 1994 the bank's introductory rate was five per cent compared to the majority rate of 9.5 per cent; and from April, 6.95 per cent compared to 8.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This irregularity will occur whenever a special introductory rate is offered by the National Australia Bank. This results in a reduction of interest charges to customers and interest receipts by the bank, and a reduction in the Commonwealth subsidy payment for each month that the lower interest rate applies. Potentially, continuation of the present situation would result in the Commonwealth receiving what could only be described as windfall savings of up to $400,000 in a full year, depending on the particular interest rates that apply at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth have agreed that subclause 5.15 of the agreement should be amended so that borrowers under the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme have the benefit of the special introductory loan interest rates under the same conditions that they are available to the public; that is, the special rates would apply only for new borrowers and for the period that those rates are normally available to ordinary members of the public. Compared with applying the bank's majority rate to all borrowers, the saving to the Commonwealth would be about $100,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enable the changes to be made, section 35 of the act will have to be amended to remove the prohibition on amending subclause 5.15 of the agreement. The bill achieves this by removing the reference to subclause 5.15 from section 35 of the act. I would like to stress that the proposed amendment of the agreement, as outlined, will still be subject to clause 20 of the agreement which provides that any amendment to the agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The structure of the legislation to amend the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 is most interesting. It is a little unusual in that the main anomaly being rectified is in fact not addressed in the legislation. The legislation removes a restriction by allowing adjustments to the underlying agreement in order to rectify the anomaly to which the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Punch) refers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not often that the parliament considers what might be described as arms-length legislation dealing with an arms-length agreement&mdash;indeed, an agreement in which in another sense the parliament almost forgoes some of its powers to relate to and adjust by virtue of yet another section which the minister referred to in his second reading speech. He stated that clause 20 of the agreement still stands. Clause 20 provides that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any amendment to the Agreement will have no effect unless it is confirmed in writing by the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that the federal parliament can bring on a further amendment in this area of the law and yet that would not apply if the National Australia Bank for its part declined to allow the underlying agreement to be adjusted? I do not believe that we will get to that stage, quite obviously. Equally, I do think that, perhaps in another place, in the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and other committee processes, there will be some examination of the relationship of this legislation to the responsibilities of the minister, the responsibilities of the government and the outcome of this framework adjustment to rectify an anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of the anomaly, the coalition has no objection to the thrust as detailed in the speech by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Indeed, clearly it was always intended for the new borrowers and therefore we will not oppose the passage of this legislation. But I do highlight to the House that it is, in a sense, framework legislation. It is removing a caveat in order that that underlying agreement can be adjusted. The bill itself does not address the anomaly. I take note of that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we have an adequate Defence Force home loan scheme in the broad. One only has to look across to Russia to see the horrific problems it has with its army at the moment as elements of the Russian Red Army come home after many years in East Germany or in Latvia. Also, under further agreements, over a period of time the Red Army will withdraw from the Baltic nations, which I am very glad to see, and return to Russia. That is now creating huge logistical headaches in relation to the housing of the Russian army on Russian soil in the Russian Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there is always a morale problem associated with inadequate housing for defence personnel. That in turn results in a breakdown in law and order. As reports indicated overnight, the Russian army for its part is having enormous problems with even maintaining its national service compliance. Perhaps underlying that problem are the conditions, especially with regard to the important matter of housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, here in Australia so many defence families are shunted around Australia by virtue of the career stream they take within the navy, army or air force. A soldier can commence his career in Kapooka, move to core training in Singleton, move to the Brisbane cluster of defence units, a few years later move to the Townsville cluster and then get transferred down to the Seymour cluster. In that process there is quite a deal of disruption. By that stage also, that same soldier is starting to look ahead to a period beyond his service in the army, his ability to settle down with his family at some chosen location and therefore a home of his own, regardless of what he might pick up on the rental market when he gets posted from area to area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a raft of assistance, removal and otherwise, is provided by the federal government and by the department with regard to these movements. Nevertheless, I do not think we should underestimate what we ask of our serving personnel in the navy, army and air force. It is a particularly disruptive way of life with a heavy impact on their families and the education of their children. The same might also be said of personnel of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with a raft of postings around Australia and overseas. These postings often entail very real hardship and, again, a disruptive impact on the families and the educational opportunities of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the coalition is supportive of this curious legislation&mdash;curious in terms of its structure&mdash;we highlight the obligation of this parliament to see that the right thing shall be done by those who serve their country in the navy, army and air force. This legislation should ensure that the right thing shall be done in respect of their housing, be they involved in the mapping and the like carried out by important units of the army located at Bendigo or in the work carried out by units elsewhere around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of concern amongst defence forces personnel in the last few days following the leaking of a report which suggests that veterans' entitlements will be cut and that there will be a restructuring of the onus of proof and other aspects of the determining system for ex-service personnel&mdash;measures that are partly encompassed by this legislation. That report is yet to be tabled in the parliament. I challenge the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) to do the right thing, table the report and provide a response from the government to ease the burden on veterans, ex-servicemen and women and serving personnel because, as Ben Chifley told this parliament some four or five decades ago, it is the responsibility of this House to see that the right thing shall be done for those who serve their country. It is in that context that I join with my colleagues the shadow minister for defence, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Senator MacGibbon, in expressing our concern about the way the report suggests that there is wholesale overpayment of disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In sharp contrast, on the very day that that report was leaked I happened to be in Childers, Queensland, with my colleagues the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) and the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss). I think this is relevant, just in passing, to the debate on this bill. We came across a veteran who has had a bullet near his spine since World War II and who is receiving only a 10 per cent disability pension. That is what he gets for his service to his country in time of war. This is the complete antithesis of what we were led to believe was the score, with the leaked government report suggesting wholesale cutbacks and changes to the determining system for veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be fair, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has not yet had a chance to speak to the House about this. I sincerely hope he does soon because there is no more vigorous network around the community&mdash;perhaps there is one other, which I have encountered in recent weeks&mdash;than the veterans' network, the RSL, and related organisations. I have a great deal of respect for the RSL and war widows. They want to know exactly where the government does stand on that report and they want to know quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of one veteran who lives in Childers, Queensland, with a bullet near his spine and who has just a 10 per cent disability pension and on behalf of many other veterans I make the plea that the right thing be done for those who served their country in the army, navy and air force in time of war, and that includes in Vietnam, Korea, Malaya, World War II, World War I and the peacekeeping efforts which abound today. As we speak, Australian solders and others are still serving in UN peacekeeping efforts in the Sahara, the Middle East and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, some very interesting defence developments are now taking place around the Indian Ocean rim, notably with India and other nations. This country quite properly, in terms of trade, defence and other issues, has been well focused on the Pacific and the Asia-Pacific region. This country helped set up the APEC organisation, which has gathered its own momentum, and I am fully supportive of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now need to refocus on the Indian Ocean in addition to, not instead of, the Asia-Pacific region. To do that, we need to look at some very interesting developments with the armed forces of some of the Indian Ocean rim countries and the very sweeping developments taking place in South Africa and elsewhere.

I challenge any housing project anywhere in Australia to come up with a more innovative standard than at Wattle Grove in Sydney&mdash;an outstanding example of urban housing; an outstanding example of how defence personnel can be mixed with the private sector. It is a credit to the Defence Housing Authority and is indeed a credit to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not always agree with everything the honourable member for Farrer, the Leader of the National Party, says but I have to agree with what he said about our investment in the people in the defence forces. In our defence forces in this country, and in any country, we make a tremendous investment in the personnel&mdash;in the training of them and in bringing them up to that very high standard which we require. It is essential that they be housed in appropriate conditions. The special regiment at Seaward Village in Perth is one housing project where there is not a mixture because of the very nature of the work that the personnel have to do there. Often they are away from their homes on all sorts of tasks so it is important that we house them in appropriate conditions. I have always felt that the investment we make in the defence personnel is complemented by the investment we make in the housing of these people. The investment that is made in the housing is an investment in our defence personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the authority has made considerable improvements to the standard of defence housing stock in the years since its inception. Approximately 75 per cent of the total housing stock was of a substandard quality in 1988 compared with the 75 per cent of good quality stock in our present position. There are members on both sides of the chamber who have served in the defence forces and we have been very fortunate to have the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor)&mdash;each has held a senior position in the RAAF and in the navy, respectively&mdash;serving on the public works committee. They often contrasted the standard of housing today with the standard of housing that they had to endure in their 20 years or so in the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority is highly responsive to a repairs and maintenance program. There is a two yearly cycle of non-urgent maintenance, and a survey conducted recently showed that 98 per cent were satisfied with the results. I have state housing in my area and I am yet to find a 98 per cent satisfaction rate with the maintenance and repair of the houses. One of the major features of the authority's operations has been the extensive use of the private sector, which must meet its exacting standards. There has been a renegotiation of the longstanding agreements with the states under which much of the defence housing stock has been leased to the Department of Defence from the states and there are joint ventures with private developers which provide an economic supply of serviced lots for the authority's needs and profits from sales of other lots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority places much store on continuous consultation and feedback from the defence force families to ensure that the organisation is responsive to their reasonable requirements&mdash;I know this for a fact. Every time we have a hearing there is always a representative of the spouses association present. When we go on inspections, whether it is on new houses or old stock, we always meet with personnel and the families in those houses. I believe that the Defence Housing Authority takes great stock of what the users of the end products say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each full year of operation, the authority has exceeded the rate of return of five per cent on assets agreed with the government. The authority, as an organisation that is active in the housing market, has accepted an onus to contribute to the ideals of the better cities program. Recent projects have demonstrated its commitment to urban infill and careful regard for habitability. It has developed community facilities as a contribution to the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When disposing of poorer housing the authority has made improvements to lift the general tone of the area and reserved part of the stock as display homes.

In doing so, I congratulate the Defence Housing Authority for what it has achieved and I congratulate the successive ministers for defence personnel on the support that they have always given to the Defence Housing Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very happy to speak in support of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 1994. As has been previously mentioned, this really seeks to correct a marketing development that was not contemplated when the original agreement was brought into place. We are not generally used to banks being innovative, but these days, as a way of encouraging first home owners, they usually offer a fixed rate housing interest loan at a much lower rate than the current variable rate. Of course, this has led to an anomaly. This is what the bill seeks to redress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), whose committee has done such a good job in supervising the plans for improved defence housing, it is very important that our serving men and women have access to housing which is at least as good, if not better, given the itinerant nature of their occupation. I think it is fair to say that a great deal of good is being done. As a member of the defence subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I know that the members of that subcommittee take a great deal of interest in these matters whenever going around particular bases looking at the latest developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is worth repeating to the House, particularly since my contribution is gathering an audience, that the Defence Housing Authority currently provides some 23,000 houses. After six years of operation, we have more than doubled the number of good quality houses. I think that is something to be very pleased about. We have halved the number of unsatisfactory houses. I guess it is really a blot on any government&mdash;present or, particularly, past&mdash;that we should have to classify housing as unsatisfactory, but we have halved the number. In six years the Defence Housing Authority has either bought, built or leased something like 13,000 good quality houses and disposed of some 10,600 houses that were of a poor standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence personnel, of course, do not get a choice about where they are posted. On average, they serve in a posting for two years. For example, if they were at Holsworthy and were being posted to Darwin, they would not be given the choice of whether they would like Darwin, Melbourne, Cairns or Rockhampton. Mobility is a factor of their lives. Therefore, a lot of them do not have an opportunity to actually secure an investment in a private house in the way the majority of other working men and women of Australia do. So the role of the Defence Housing Authority is very important, as is the ability for existing members, and particularly ex-members, of the Australian Defence Force to have assistance to establish themselves in private houses. The honourable member for Throsby mentioned the Seaward housing in Western Australia. At the subcommittee's most recent visit we were able to look at that development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And will be there for a lot longer too, I might add and, more importantly, you will not be coming over. The second thing is that since that case of fraud in 1992, which was identified last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>, new procedures have been introduced by my predecessor, following an internal audit by the department which resulted in some 44 recommendations for change. Of those 44 recommendations, 40 have already been acted upon. In a report that was tabled in this place on 18 March in the autumn sittings of the parliament, the Auditor-General referred to the internal audit procedures associated with the DEET programs. Obviously, the Leader of the Opposition has not bothered to look beyond the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program. Page 81, paragraph 6.26, of the report reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent performance audit review of IT systems by the ANAO&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian National Audit Office&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has confirmed that the Department now exercises effective control over access to its computer facilities and databases. This is a significant factor in providing assurance that the completeness and accuracy of accounts and records are not compromised by unauthorised entries or alterations.</PARA>
<PARA>The second thing I can tell the Leader of the Opposition is that steps have already been taken to ensure that the opportunity for fraud is significantly minimised. But we will go further in the announcements tomorrow, and the Leader of the Opposition will just have to wait for the detail of them. What we will be announcing tomorrow will not just go to additional procedures to catch fraud; it will also improve the delivery of the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am on my feet, I might say that the essence of that report on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last night was that, with all the money that the government might be contemplating spending, it is incapable of spending it effectively. That was really the thrust of the report. But let us look at the success rate in what DEET and the CES have achieved to date. In the last three years, the total number of labour market programs has gone up from 325,000 to 520,000. The proportion of programs accommodating the long-term unemployed who have been placed there as a result of those programs has gone up from 47 per cent to 67 per cent. As for the positive outcomes arising from these programs, the success rate has gone from 58.6 per cent, in the case of the jobstart program, to 61 per cent. I would hardly suggest that that is a damning case for ineffectiveness on the part of DEET.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those on the other side who think they might be crowing as a result of last night's story to look at what the Chamber of Manufactures had to say today in its press release. It said that the `CES is fine by them'. It is a large employer organisation that is obviously getting good service from the CES. One letter has been sent to me today in disgust of the way the ABC portrayed the story last night in not talking about any positive outcomes&mdash;not even suggesting that there might have been some success in what we have done. Nova Employment sent this letter today. It is written by Martin Wren, who is the service manager. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Attached is our correspondence sent to the ABC following their "DEET Street" program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realise that this letter will achieve nothing and the ABC will sit smugly back and feel it has acted in the public interest but I wanted you to know that the people within the CES with whom the NOVA program works are dedicated, honest and committed to assisting the long-term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a great shame that the allegations made in this program could not be more effectively dealt with. It was biased nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA>All I am saying to this House is that the CES is not perfect, but it has been very successful to date. With the additions and new initiatives that we will announce tomorrow, it will be even more effective&mdash;because we are a government committed to doing something to ensure that the long-term unemployed get a chance in this economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his continuing interest in this issue. Earlier this year I advised the House that licensees A and B had agreed to a full digital transmission standard to allow the provision of satellite pay television in Australia in accordance with the requirements of the Broadcasting Services Act. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that the standard has now received all the necessary legal and technical clearances that are required. The standard was also reviewed by the previous Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development to ensure that there is a capacity for Australian manufacturers to get a benefit from the development of the new technology needed to provide pay television into Australians' homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As all regulatory and legal requirements have now been met, I have today signed a notice for the formal gazettal of the digital standard.

It will permit the licensees to complete their manufacturing arrangements and will encourage the finalisation of industry plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also previously stated the importance which the government places on ensuring that Australians still have access to free to air television on events of national significance and of important cultural significance&mdash;including, no doubt, matches of the Steelers when they are in the grand final. I also make it clear to the House that it is my very strong intention to take on board the report from the Australian Broadcasting Authority into this very issue, this question of siphoning, and I expect that report from the ABA on about 13 May.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Shortland might be aware that there has been some speculation that the New South Wales government, or perhaps some people on the Olympics organising committee, might wish to have a pay TV monopoly on television coverage of the Sydney 2000 Olympics. I want to make it clear to the House that it would be my intention to reject any proposal from the New South Wales government to have a pay TV monopoly on coverage of the Sydney Olympics.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said before, the last comprehensive analysis was undertaken in 1992. Since that time, some 40 initiatives that were identified in the assessment have been acted upon. The remaining four require the introduction of a national network, and it is the national network that we will be announcing funding for tomorrow. So I am confident that what we can do is adequately respond to each of those identified failings within the system. But I do not ask the honourable member for Chisholm to take just my word for it. Listen again to what the Auditor-General has had to say in a document tabled in the parliament which the honourable member as the shadow spokesman has obviously not even read. His idea of researching this issue is to watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just say, it has been very interesting to find out because, when I went on to be interviewed by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> on Friday, it was not prepared to tell me in advance the nature of the allegations that were going to be put to air on Monday night. The ABC obviously has an interest in informing the public, but it does not terribly much want to have a minister who might be able to get some answers for them on the program coming forward with them on the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Mr Evans, whose case was identified, I can go further and say that not only as a result of the initiatives, the 44 that have been identified and the 40 that had been acted upon, Mr Evans has been prosecuted and steps are well in hand to recover all of the moneys that were fraudulently misappropriated by both he and his accomplices. To date, significantly more than half has already been recovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The steps that we have in place involve a preparedness not only to prosecute the person, which will result in gaol if they are found guilty, but also the ability to recover by tapping into their superannuation entitlements or the sale of their house. I believe that the taxpayers' money can be well protected. What we will be able to ensure, as a result of the new initiatives that we are about to announce on top of what has already been done, is that the case of future fraud will be significantly minimised.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question and inform him that the news on this fundamental question of social justice is mixed. Certainly there is some good news. I am delighted to be able to advise the House, for example, that last week the state of New South Wales finally, and some would say belatedly, followed the lead of other states and territories in signing onto the national equity program for schools, or NEPS, as it has become known. With NEPS now in place, schools right around the country can benefit from a coherent approach which ensures nationally consistent targeting of funds to help lift the educational outcomes for disadvantaged students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under NEPS the Commonwealth provides some $280 million each year to help disadvantaged students through a strategically integrated mix of programs. The overall aim of NEPS is to assist the one million students who are educationally disadvantaged in one way or another and whose schooling is therefore less rewarding and less effective than that of their friends. The 1994 equity agreement, signed by the states and the non-government systems, covers objectives, targets, evaluation procedures, mechanisms for community involvement and the provision of nationally consistent data on outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under NEPS the states agree to spend Commonwealth school funds provided for equity on agreed programs and also declare their own spending. Around half of the one million students whom NEPS will assist are economically disadvantaged. Others are geographically isolated, disabled or are from a non-English speaking background or an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background. There are also those students who have experienced family breakdown, violence or abuse, leaving them more likely not to complete year 12.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ensuring that all young people from backgrounds such as these are given all the help possible is an objective that this government's commitment to social justice means it must address, because it is not just about ensuring equity in schooling; it is about laying the foundations for equality of access to employment opportunities in later life. Young people who are disadvantaged in their schooling tend to be the ones who drop out of the education system and, as we all know, the inevitable and catastrophic effect of this situation is that their prospect of long-term, satisfying and productive work is greatly reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early school leavers alienated by their experiences in formal education are 2 1/2 times more likely to be unemployed and eight to 10 times more likely to join the pool of long-term unemployed. The Commonwealth recognises that funding alone&mdash;and certainly its funding&mdash;cannot entirely address these equity issues. That is why we are committed to the adoption of the national strategy for equity in schooling with the objective of providing an overarching national commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here the news is not all that good because some of the states represented by the political partners of my friends opposite do not share the same commitment that we have to ensuring better educational opportunity for disadvantaged young Australians. For example, at last week's meeting of state, Commonwealth and territory ministers, the conservative states used their numbers quite cynically to blight the adoption of a national strategy. They talked about the need for further discussion and about the need for further reports, but the reality of their position is that they would prefer to keep their own lumbering state bureaucracies happy by resisting change at whatever cost to Australia's young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is determined that a national focus will be given to nationally important issues. It will continue to work towards a national strategy, tired arguments about states rights notwithstanding. The equity agreements which were signed with the states are a significant and important step towards that objective.</PARA>

What we as a nation need to do at the moment is pull together behind solid policies, not have them bagged on the basis of a couple of examples that they do not even have the wit or capacity to get further information upon and that they have not even bothered to read the Auditor-General's report upon as to steps taken to date to correct it. Look at the success of the programs and understand that if it were not for those programs there would be many hundreds of thousands of long-term unemployed who would not be in work today.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our growth rate certainly was, as the member for McMillan said, four per cent through 1993. On a year-on-year basis, it was a little less than that, 3.7 per cent, but still a highly commendable rate. It was certainly not far below the rate at which we grew through the period 1984 to 1989&mdash;around 4 1/2 per cent&mdash;during which time we were about the fastest growing country in the Western world. So we are getting back into that region, and that is very comforting. That compares to our budget forecast for GDP growth of 2 3/4 per cent. Clearly, we are doing much better than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we contrast that with other developed countries, we can see just how good our performance actually was in 1993. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the rate of growth for industrialised countries in 1993 was not our 3.7 per cent but 1.2 per cent. The OECD estimate for the growth rate in 1993 of its constituent countries was 1.1 per cent. There are only four countries in the OECD that had growth of three per cent or more in 1993. They were Australia, Turkey, New Zealand and the United States. There were only seven countries that had growth of over two per cent&mdash;the four countries that I have just mentioned plus Canada, Norway and Ireland. So the rate of growth that Australia chalked up in 1993 was absolutely at the top end of the scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there were 10 countries in the OECD which went backwards in 1993. They included some of the major economies like Germany. Western Germany went back by almost two per cent. France and Italy had declining GDP in 1993. Japan, our major trading partner, had absolutely minimal growth of 0.1 per cent. So, compared with all of those countries, we have done exceedingly well. There were two countries that did better than us in 1993&mdash;Turkey and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of New Zealand I think we should bear one thing in mind, and that is that New Zealand has only recently, in 1993, regained the level of GDP that it achieved in 1986. In fact, it is now 4.7 per cent above that level. But since 1986, when New Zealand previously peaked, our GDP has grown by not 4.7 per cent but 23 per cent. So New Zealand has a hell of a lot of catching up to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately for us, our Asian trading partners, excluding Japan&mdash;of course these Asian trading partners are increasingly important to us&mdash;have been growing rapidly. That has clearly been of assistance to us. The growth rates have varied from, at the low end, Hong Kong at five per cent to, at the upper end, Singapore at 10.7 per cent and China at an amazing 13 1/2 per cent. So they are clearly providing rapid growth in markets for our exports and assisting our further development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that the growth prospects for developed countries in 1994-95 are considerably better than the outcomes in 1993. The United States is expected to increase its growth rate further in 1994 to something in the order of 3.9 per cent, according to the International Monetary Fund. Germany and Japan, which either have been going backwards or have been virtually stagnant, are expected to pick up in 1994 and return to growth of over 2 per cent in 1995. Overall, the forecast for industrialised countries for 1994-95 is that they will grow a little over 2 per cent in 1994 and over 2 1/2 per cent in 1995&mdash;considerably faster growth than they achieved in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is very important to Australia. We grew last year at 3.7 per cent with the other industrialised countries growing at 1.2 per cent, so we have been way in excess of these comparable countries. We can grow faster than the rest of the world if we have a capacity to be very competitive and to increase our market share. In a sense, that is what we were doing in 1993 with very strong growth in volumes of exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it helps us if the rest of the world grows faster. It helps us through increased demand for our exports, greater volumes, and it also helps our commodity prices and in pushing up our terms of trade. We can increasingly look forward to that working for us over the next couple of years. So, in answer to the member for McMillan, we have very good reasons to be confident that in the next couple of years we will be able to not only maintain the rate of growth that we had in 1993 but also improve upon it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Bass for my first question. The honourable member is referring to a very important set of statistics, which honourable members would do well to heed, from the Australian Bureau of Statistics crime and safety survey report which shows, sadly, that we still have very high levels of sexual assaults going unreported. The report says that some 75 per cent of sexual assaults on women in 1993 were not reported. Unfortunately, that figure is sadly similar to the figures for previous years. Furthermore, only a small number of those reports resulted in a conviction and 66 per cent of those who were assaulted knew the offender. It is a very serious problem for women in our community, a problem involving offences which have been repeated over and over again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that women are now less tolerant of this state of affairs and more vocal about the need to improve these circumstances. The states in particular and the legal profession are taking action. The Commonwealth government, too, is moving toward a women's justice program. I would be interested to hear from honourable members opposite about their plans, through their recently discovered law and order program, to ensure that violence against women does not continue at this rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They might be aware&mdash;I hope they are&mdash;of a recent survey conducted by the Australian Council of Women. Some 20,000 postcards were returned in this survey about issues of concern to women. Some 5,000 responses actually mentioned fear of violence and the incidence of violence as major concerns. They also showed concern about the fact that the police generally and the legal system do not appear to take violence against women and sexual assault seriously, and the survey respondents are very wary indeed about the responsiveness of the criminal justice system to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important that we as members here recognise the need for national action, because some of the states are not pulling their weight in this area. In my own state, for example, one of the ministers responsible for community development has significantly reduced funding for programs designed to reduce violence against women. He has said on many occasions that he is totally opposed to the idea of women reporting violence within the home to the police. So Commonwealth action is necessary and we will be working with the various bodies that I have mentioned, including the state governments, to establish a national women's justice program to make sure that those figures that we heard about on Friday night are not repeated.</PARA>

I suggest that one important step that he might take is to pick up that invitation, now of 10 months' duration, go across to my department and try to find out from it what is really bugging him rather than to just ask these inane questions which, quite frankly, are getting him nowhere.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Dunkley and this House both know, the excellent outcomes which continue to flow from the Commonwealth's massive expansion of the TAFE system are a continuing source of great pride to this government. The evidence in this year's enrolment statistics make it quite clear that young Australians have heard the government's message, and that is that university is not the only worthwhile post-school training alternative. Quite simply, a degree is not the only way to get a job. This message is being repeatedly vindicated.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A survey reported in this week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> conducted for the Yellow Pages organisation gives the finding that TAFE students are preferred over university graduates as prospective employees by small business&mdash;the sector which is, of course, the greatest source of job growth. Some 47 per cent of small businesses in the survey said that they preferred TAFE qualified people compared with only 10 per cent who favoured university graduates. Of the businesses surveyed, over half employed TAFE graduates while less than a third had recent university graduates on their staff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons the businesses in the survey gave for their preferences are quite instructive. They preferred TAFE students because they are perceived as having more relevant and practical skills. In contrast, only 40 per cent of those businesses employing graduates thought that their education had equipped them adequately for small business jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That is good news for the nation's vocational education system, so good that it seems that everybody wants to get in on the act. Honourable members might recall that the Victorian government announced a major funding commitment in last week's economic statement to expand that state's TAFE system. That was a commitment that the Commonwealth should be delighted to commend without reservation. Regrettably, we cannot because much of the funding that was announced by the Victorian government was supplied not by it but by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Wednesday, for example, the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> reported that the state government was spending $10 million at the Box Hill College of TAFE. In fact, that is all Commonwealth funding that was announced last October. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> also reported that the state government would be spending $18 million at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Mr Kennett and his colleagues were wrong again; the Commonwealth is providing the entire $18 million. The list goes on and on, with the Victorians claiming no less than $80 million of Commonwealth expenditure on TAFE as its own. The Commonwealth is always delighted to see demand-driven growth in TAFE places because it is meeting business needs but, in this case, the Kennett government seems either unwilling or perhaps, more charitably, unable to allocate credit where it is due.</PARA>

For those honourable members who need reminding, this is a $30,000 million industry which is 40 per cent of  Australia's total exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated in the question of the honourable member for Lyons, there has been some reporting recently that Australian mining companies are `shifting', as it has been said in the press, their resources offshore. Nothing could be further from the truth. I remind honourable members that 20 per cent of every dollar spent in the world on mineral exploration is spent in this country. I also remind the House that Australia's mining industry cannot be compared with anywhere else in the world. We are the best of any country at mineral and resources exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australians do not realise that the largest mining company in the world is Australian. Of course, that company is BHP. Of course Australian companies should be investing money offshore. Why should we explore only in Australia? It is important for Australian companies that are world leaders to ensure that they exploit resources where they can be found. That is not to say that they are using those resources only  to explore offshore. In fact, a lot of exploration is still taking place in Australia, as I have explained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recess I had the opportunity to visit the Carpentaria-Mount Isa mineral province. This is a unique development in Australia. Five major mining companies are working with the Northern Territory government, the Queensland government and the Commonwealth government to develop a region which is great in mineral wealth and which is probably the greatest exploration region in this country. The mining companies involved in that mineral province are BHP, MIM, CRA, Placer Pacific and the Western Mining Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just two of those projects which I had the opportunity to visit offer us enormous opportunity in the near future. CRA's Century mine, which is in final feasibility, could provide one of the world's largest zinc mines. BHP's Cannington mine could provide us with the world's largest silver mine with significant resources of lead. So, whilst Australian mining companies are looking for mineral resources around the world, they are certainly not ignoring Australia. One in five dollars of all exploration dollars spent anywhere in the world is spent in this country.</PARA>

In previous times, newspapers would not have been able to comment on such issues while they were before the court. However, it appears that a statement by Sir Anthony Mason in November 1991 is now interpreted as permitting a situation where newspapers can comment on matters currently before the High Court. My question is this: is there now an anomalous situation whereby the media can debate the merits of certain issues which are before the High Court while members of parliament cannot debate them in this chamber because of the sub judice rule?

Firstly, the minister made much mirth about the CES paper that has been leaked achieving only 75 per cent of its target three-quarters of the way through the year. If you care to read the DEET report&mdash;which you clearly have not&mdash;you will see that it says it is pro rata. It is being done on a pro rata basis for the year, so you do not know what is going on there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, you have shown that the risk management assessment for your department was last done in 1992. So in spite of the expansion of labour market programs, in spite of the increase in case work and long-term unemployment, your risk management system is two years old. Also, you replied that allegations that you had been hiding were a great falsehood and misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me repeat on the record: last night you apparently went to ground. We were told by the ABC that it tried repeatedly to get you and could not; we were told by Adelaide and Perth radio that they had tried to get you and could not. So it is good that you have come in here to answer the questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You have made much about DEET's performance data. It is only three months out; it is not a full response from participants. You seem to think that a 60 per cent outcome means that 60 per cent of them got them from DEET. What is happening is that they are churning and churning training programs around. A positive outcome does not mean that they have got a job. Anyone who has done first year statistics knows that `correlation' does not imply `causality'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to get personal, as has been your only defence; I will talk about DEET. We had a program last night called `DEET Street'. That has to be a street of shame. I will talk about the nature of unemployment, how you have attempted to disguise the problem, the feeble attempt of the Labor Party over 11 years to deal with unemployment&mdash;that is an 11-year history of failure&mdash;the allegations last night and the reason we believe that in the end the only way to address this is through an independent judicial inquiry. </PARA>

There are 580,000 people who are underemployed as they can only find a few hours work a week. Those figures are from the ABS survey last year. That is 6.8 per cent of the work force, which is up from 3.8 per cent at the end of the last recession. There are 160,000 people who have given up. That is half a million people, half a million kids in that, whose parents have no work. If we add 903,000 to 580,000 to 160,000, we have 18 per cent of the Australian work force out of work, underemployed or who have given up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But why this has to be addressed and why it is culpable and negligent not to do so are the social consequences. EPAC looked at this some time ago: it looked at divorce, marriage and crime. If we could reduce unemployment by just four percentage points, it reckons we would have 800 fewer divorces, 4,000 more marriages and 20 fewer homicides. We have youth suicide in Australia at a world record: a response to desperation, hopelessness and despair. It has been high for most of the last decade. There has been no concerted or coordinated response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA has looked at the health impacts of unemployment. If a man is unemployed, the AMA reckons that his mortality is up 17 per cent, there are 52 per cent who have higher blood pressure, 50 per cent more doctors visits, 250 per cent more mental disorders and 68 per cent more bronchitis. If a woman is unemployed, there are 42 per cent with more serious chronic illnesses, 35 per cent more hospital admissions, 80 per cent more outpatient visits and 43 per cent more smoking. Unemployed people have twice as many skin diseases, nervous diseases and emotional disorders. The AMA had a look to see whether the sickness causes the unemployment or unemployment causes the sickness. Quite clearly, its conclusion was the latter: unemployment causes the sickness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the basis on which we are having this debate. That is the basis on which we say unemployment is the most pressing social and economic problem in the country. What has been the response? The response has been an attempt to fiddle the figures: if we cannot do anything realistic about it, we will try to make it disappear. So we will have a mature age allowance: if a person is 60 years of age and out of work for more than 12 months, we will slough you off the figures. How many? We do not know; but 30,000 people applied for the mature age allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the prospect of young people not being eligible for the dole. There are 40,000 there who will disappear from the figures. I think back to before the last election to the shrill and overblown claims of `slave wages of $3.50 an hour'. We have had reports of your $3.20, and we will look forward to seeing how that goes. There is a job compact to take some 150,000 to 300,000 people off the figures. There is a much greater proportion of people on sickness benefits, sickness pensions. There is a massive expansion of the CDEP program which takes Aboriginal people off the figures. There is a very high school retention rate, of which people like to be proud, but a lot of those students cannot find jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are 14 months into this parliament and we now have the government's first attempt to do anything of substance about this problem. In 1993, at the opening of the Labor Party's election campaign, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said that the `overriding priority for the next three years is jobs'. If we look at that, we see the only jobs those opposite appear to be worried about are their own. They have sat on their hands for 14 months and done nothing. We have had reports that it will be January next year before this starts. If this is such an overriding problem, why are we waiting a further seven months? The answer is simple: because nine months from then is September and people will come back on the figures in October so those opposite are clear for an election with them out of the way and having statistically disappeared right up until then. If, as we hear, this is such a pressing social problem, try to explain how it takes 21 months to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much talk about research. I have gone back and had a look at some of the promises which have been made over the last 11 years. Those promises put in context what you will put in place tomorrow. At the February 1983 policy launch, the then opposition leader Hawke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One in ten Australians out of work&mdash;a figure no Australian would have believed possible a few years ago, and which no Australian Government should ever be forgiven for creating.</PARA>
<PARA>You will not be forgiven, and you cannot hide it. In August 1983 at the launch of the youth employment and skills training program, Minister Willis said that we would have 40,000 places. We did not have 40,000; we had 30,000, of which only 35 per cent were in jobs six months later. In August 1985 we had Priority One: Young Australia. Do members remember Priority One? Ten thousand youth traineeships were going to be created within the first year. All we had was billboards and lunches with executives. A year later how many had been created? Not one. In 1985 we had the jobstart program. We had a prediction of 85,000 places to be available through a wage subsidy scheme. In fact, only 42,000 were made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 we had the job training program for the unemployed. We had the same sort of overblown promises of performance. We had boasts that it was modelled on the Canadian model with a success rate of 60 to 90 per cent. What were you able to achieve? You were able to achieve 18 to 29 per cent success. In 1991 we had newstart. Do you know what that was going to do? That was going to coordinate Commonwealth employment training and income support services&mdash;exactly the same thing you will try to pretend is happening now. It did not happen three years ago; it is not going to happen tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1991 we had the budget: $200 million more for labour market programs, and this claim that rings very similar to what we hear from you day to day: `While the job market is not expected to dramatically improve in the short term, the government's labour market programs will ensure that, when the recovery comes and employment begins to accelerate, the unemployed will have the skills and training necessary to get back to work.' They certainly have not had the skills and training in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991 budget Paul Keating as Treasurer said that we would have a small fall in unemployment. It went from 9.5 to 10.5 per cent. In November 1991 we had a jobs and training rescue plan. We had this quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government now has a more than comprehensive approach to working to overcome our present labour market difficulties, with initiative in the education and training area further contributing to our efforts to position even more people to take advantage of the imminent economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>They are not very well positioned. In February 1992 we had the One Nation statement that was going to `bring about significant reductions in total unemployment'. Unemployment after that went up to 10.7 per cent. That is the sum total of your 11 years work&mdash;overblown promises, consistent inability to meet targets and consistently raising hopes that are dashed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> we had an expose on the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It showed major fraud and stolen government money; internal audits from the Australian National Audit Office and the Commonwealth DPP which suggested that information the government relies on to determine its labour market programs and whether they are funding and operating properly is seriously flawed, if not corrupt; major abuse of employer subsidy schemes; inadequate record keeping and information technology systems; irresponsible management practices; and DEET programs that are totally inappropriate to the needs of Australia's labour market. That is a comprehensive criticism of the department for which you are responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the week we had the leaking of the CES report. In 23 regions in Australia, this is how targets are being met: two out of 23 met their operational plan targets for vacancies notified; none met their job placement targets; five met their labour market commencement targets&mdash;earlier today we had the minister at the table saying, `We are targeting the long-term unemployed better'; but not according to that&mdash;one out of 23 exceeded job placements for long-term unemployed; and none achieved their program commencement targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister comes from the ACTU. His primary concern for a long time has been the work force. He has been the minister for nearly six months and only now are these reports coming out. We have to seriously question the commitment to this and we have to seriously question whether DEET has any capacity to deliver the programs being proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's defence has been, `I've been here only six months; you can't blame me.' The fact is that there have been three senior ministers responsible for the Department of Employment, Education and Training: the former member for Fremantle, the former Treasurer; the present Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley); and the present minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET was created in 1987. It has been going for seven years. It has 15,000 employees and there is no confidence at all that it can deliver these programs. There is no confidence at all that it can actually do anything worth while to meet the needs of Australia's unemployed. We believe that it is absolutely crucial to get to how, why and in what way the government has sought to address these inadequacies because unemployment is clearly the major problem facing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition get leaks from time to time. We had one a while ago which was very telling. It was: `Watch the white paper because it will try to make unemployment disappear statistically.' That will be the net result of what the government does tomorrow. It will do nothing to create jobs, there will be no growth, lots of overblown promises and lots of overblown rhetoric. As in the last 11 years, all we will see are promises that in the end are not met or kept or that are unattainable. The fact is that there is a longstanding history of incompetence, of mismanagement and of raised expectations. In the light of all of this, we believe there should be an independent judicial inquiry into this department, its performance and its effectiveness. There is no alternative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Dr Wooldridge) that there is no more important issue than unemployment. It has to be addressed not only for the social reasons he has outlined but also for economic ones. The social reasons are not just the impact on families, the increase in the crime rate and the debilitation of people who just do not see any hope for the future. I agree with him on all of those reasons. I think there are further reasons of an economic nature&mdash;I am sure he would agree with me on this&mdash;for not wasting the human resource potential that resides within the people currently out of work and whom we are seeking to get back into work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a problem unique to Australia. It is a problem being experienced certainly by every western nation, so much so that the OECD has recently commissioned a report and a ministerial meeting on how to address it. I believe that with the initiatives we are announcing tomorrow we will have the potential to lead the world in solutions to the long-term unemployment problem because we will be building on an already successful achievement rate. By committing more resources, by targeting delivery a lot better, by developing case management and by better matching the needs of would-be employees, those out of the work force, with what employers require, I believe we can achieve better outcomes than those that we have already achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is suggested by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we have not been doing anything in the 14 months that we have been in office. His suggestion as to how we solve this mammoth international and domestic problem is to have a judicial inquiry; he did not propose a solution. The judges of this country will not provide the solutions to the long-term unemployed. That is what people elect politicians to do and that is what we will be doing tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last three years this nation has expended $3 billion in labour market programs, some $1 1/2 billion in the last 12 months. On top of that is a substantial commitment to income support in the order of another $9 billion. The challenge&mdash;one that I believe we will respond effectively to tomorrow&mdash;is not only to enhance those resources but also to make the existing commitments work better for us, to make the passive income support proposals work in a more pro-active way and to get better targeting from the existing programs and better matching of the particular needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that the government's response to this issue is to try to address it in two ways. One is that we fiddled the figures and the other is that we have done nothing over the past 14 months. On the question of fiddling the figures, I put on record this letter from the Australian Statistician, Mr Ian Castles. It was written in response to a line reported in one daily newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Monday 18 April, by Glen Milne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Milne said that essentially what the government plans to do is use the document to alter a raft of definitions covering unemployment&mdash;in other words, that our strategy is to define the problem away. This is not what the government is saying; this is the independent chief statistician of the nation responding to this allegation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which he has asserted again today and is now walking away from. The shadow minister should stick this in his research pile and digest it. Mr Castles stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can assure your readers that whatever changes may be made to existing labour market programs, or whatever programs may be introduced, they will not give rise to a change in the definitions of employed and unemployed persons, including that of the long-term unemployed, used by the ABS.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we cannot define the problem away. I have said publicly on many occasions that it is not our intention in the response in the white paper to define the problem away. People are confusing the gateway associated with the job compact with other levels of assistance. In essence, as the green paper highlighted, the compact will offer the opportunity of a placement. By offering the opportunity of a placement, the activity test can be enforced far more rigorously because what we will be doing is offering people a job. That is not to say that those who are not in the compact will not get assistance. Everyone who meets certain levels of criteria will be entitled to differing forms of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The form of benefit will have regard to the extent of disadvantage attaching to the individual in question. In the main, the extent of disadvantage will be defined by the length of time the individual has been out of work. We have looked at other measures by which that can be done, but in the main that will be the definition. But it will not be the sole definition. We are not seeking to define the problem away. The statistician says that we cannot, but I want to assure the House that we are not seeking to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the assertion that we have done nothing in the past 14 months, I say that in the past 12 months the government has created 177,000 jobs. We have increased the numbers of people under jobstart from 150,000 to another 160,000 this year. We have targeted more of the long-term unemployed and we have achieved higher success rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that we have created 177,000 jobs in 12 months. Our election commitment was to 500,000 jobs. We are already ahead of the target only one year into the term, and 120,000 of those 177,000 jobs have been created in the past six months. So our expectation is that we will exceed our target. In other words, not only are we delivering our promise but we will exceed it. Yet the honourable member for Chisholm has the gall to get up and say that we have done nothing. His solution is to have a judicial inquiry so that the judges of the country can tell us about the solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go then to the assertion that there has not been success in the nature of the programs that the Commonwealth has conducted. In 1991-92 there was a total of 325,000 labour market program placements. Close to 59,000 of them were under jobstart. Under jobstart in those days only 47.2 per cent of the long-term unemployed were being targeted, but we were achieving a 58.6 per cent success rate in outcomes&mdash;outcomes that are measured by internationally recognised standards and which are better than other countries applying those same standards. That was the position two years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone from 325,000 places to a target this year of 520,400 places&mdash;in other words, a significant ramping up of effort, a significant commitment of resources, but no diminution in the success rate, despite the fact that we are now more actively targeting the long-term unemployed, the people who are harder to place. We are achieving higher success rates with harder targets. Yet the honourable member for Chisholm says that the CES has been ineffective and he bases that ineffectiveness on four stories that were contained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that there are examples of abuse. I accept that there can be circumstances in which significant improvements can be made. But what he cannot deny is the success rate under these programs to date. The success rate of the jobstart program is some 61 per cent; the vast majority of people actually go into jobs. The assertion that they are not real jobs is wrong. I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to look again at the statistics that are publicly available that confirm that view: a 61 per cent positive rate of people now being targeted who are at least 12 months out of the work force and who the employers of the country say they do not want to employ because they are not job ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have effectively gotten them job ready because of the labour market program placements. Not only have we got them job ready but we have got them jobs. Two-thirds of people who would still be on the dole queue have got jobs. That has been done with the way the programs have been run to date with no case management focus&mdash;or very little because it has just commenced in the last month or so. In the white paper tomorrow there will be a significant commitment to the enhancement of the case management approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that not only have we got success rates to date and not only have we got an effective CES delivering programs but also we can improve it. It will improve for two fundamental reasons. One is that we are to commit more resources to it and improve the delivery mechanism. The second is that we are not going to rely solely on the CES for the delivery of programs. In other words, we are sensibly going to open up opportunities for competition for those who are prepared to commit themselves to the same requirements that we believe have been the basis for successful placement to date; that is, case management, better matching of the client needs, emphasis on training and, importantly, the commitment to placements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no-one misunderstand the significance of training in terms of a person's employability. Whilst jobstart, for the long-term unemployed, has produced a success rate of 61 per cent, those who have gone through traineeships have experienced an 85 per cent success rate&mdash;81 per cent in jobs. Again, I ask the honourable member to have regard to those figures before he is so quick to denigrate the success of the CES based on certain revelations last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am prepared to accept that we can improve. I am prepared to accept that the sorts of things that were identified last night are not acceptable. Where cases of fraud are identified, I repeat what I said in question time: we will stamp them out. But we have taken significant steps over the last year and a half to successfully counter those allegations, so much so that the Auditor-General has given it a tick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, as for the honourable member for Chisholm's reassertion that I have been hiding, I have not. I did a doorstop yesterday. The ABC was not seeking me. I was in a cabinet meeting last night. As for his assertion of the 75 per cent pro rating, that is not the advice that I have been given to date, but I will take him on his word, check it and advise him accordingly. I believe that this House will see a significant program of assistance coming forward tomorrow, one that will give hope but one that will substantially build on the success to date. I urge all honourable members to get behind it in committing the places, committing to training the nation and committing to giving the long-term unemployed a chance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are debating here today is the maladministration of DEET. We are debating the rorting and fraudulent practices that were exposed so well on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last night. In particular, we are debating the refusal of this government to accept responsibility for that. We have just had a glossing over of it today in question time and in the MPI. We are debating the inability of the minister and the government to satisfy the taxpayers and the parliament and to put down a credible and workable response to the questions that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is going on, and what has gone on, in DEET is fairly and squarely the responsibility of this government. It created it back in 1987 and the government is accountable for what has transpired since. It is riddled with inefficiencies, as we as honourable members all know since we get assailed by it in our offices every day. It is riddled with fraud and it has been unable to deliver the goods. One in three of the long-term unemployed have had no assistance at all in being directed into a program, let alone being offered a job. Today in question time the minister got up and said that the long-term unemployed are not work ready, whatever that means. I do not know how long it takes before someone is work ready. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government was elected in 1983, over 10 years ago. We are in the second decade of this government and we still have nearly one million people unemployed. The government has totally and utterly misread the economic situation in this country in the 1980s. It has put us in a position where the country is out of money. The government is out of ideas and, quite frankly, it should be out of office. If it had even approached anything near the truth in what it told us in the last election campaign, it would have been thrown out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The jobless in this country are without hope. All the government can offer is a multiplicity of promises yet again.

Tomorrow night we will hear about taxpayers' money being wasted on a scale unprecedented in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if the government has had lightweight ministers administering this department. Before the name change to DEET, Minister Willis was there for four years. Following him for four years was Mr Dawkins. Then there was Minister Beazley for two years, and now we have Minister Crean. Yet we still hear more promises. The solution is to throw more money around and to have a minister mouth platitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were thrown out of office in 1972&mdash;before Whitlam took over and started to wreck this country as we knew it&mdash;the number of long-term unemployed in this country was something like 1,500. Today, it is in excess of 350,000 people. We have the longest and most educated dole queues in the advanced countries in many ways. The government is not interested in solving the problem. It is only interested in winning elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper will come out tomorrow night, and there will be a response to it. As the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Dr Wooldridge) said, we will have to wait seven months&mdash;till next year&mdash;before the government's response is put into place. The deputy leader said this is so more people can be taken off the unemployment queues in the run-up to the next election. Another reason is that it would give the government time to print the money on the printing presses that will be rolling to fund these new schemes&mdash;dubious and dishonest schemes in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that we are redefining long-term unemployment. We will take the under 18-year-olds off the dole&mdash;30,000 or 40,000 people. We will take the over 60-year-olds off the dole and put them on mature allowances&mdash;all churning and refiddling the numbers, and shuffling the dole queues. While this is going on, what is the government doing to lessen unemployment and create real jobs? It is bringing down industrial relations laws to make it harder to employ people, and it is bringing in extra taxes like the superannuation guarantee charge and the training guarantee levy, which everybody, on both sides of the chamber, now recognises is a farce. The situation is absolutely absurd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look back at what the government has done in the past. In the One Nation statement of February 1992, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, `After seven years of growth, Australians are now experiencing hard times. Nearly one million people are out of work, and families are worried about the future. This statement explains what the Keating government will do to bring back jobs and prosperity.' We know what happened following that. We had two budgets brought down by Treasurer Dawkins, both of which promised they were all about jobs, jobs, jobs. They spent billions of dollars, and the situation is virtually the same today as it was then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will get the same arguments dressed up in different words thrown at us again. The government is exhausted of all ideas. It set up this committee last year, which produced this green paper to restore full employment, to bide time.

The government will draw its response from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister wanted to do something, he could cure a few of the things that people have been writing to him about. For example, I have a letter here from the Municipal Employees' Union, written by J. Merchant, branch secretary.

<PARA>What an absolute rort! The minister has received this letter over a month ago, yet he still condones it. This is the sort of thing that he has the gall to stand up here today in question time and say that he is fixing.

Yet he has decided these things using the vehicle of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, which to me smacks very much of the Alan Jones school of journalism.

There has been no reporting of the wide-ranging risk management reforms already put in place. Why not? There has been no recognition of the organisation's overwhelming success, which is demonstrated daily through programs such as jobstart. Instead the media try to focus on what they see as a major furore about the administration of these programs. There is no major furore. There is no major fraud. The department is not riddled with fraud. The programs are not riddled with inefficiency. The only inefficiency is on the other side of the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to speak for too much longer but I say again that I support the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill. I note that in their contributions both the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) made a fairly wide-ranging contribution. I want to return to an important theme that relates to housing&mdash;that is, the conditions of service of the serving men and women in our ADF. I remind the House that no other so-called work force can be compared to the ADF. Its members are subject to unquestioning discipline, are taught to carry out orders strictly and promptly and not to argue the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anzac Day was not so long ago. It is a reminder to the nation of the contributions that our serving men and women have made in wartime, when so many of them paid the ultimate sacrifice, and in peacekeeping operations. They can at very short notice be sent anywhere overseas. They can without choice offer up their lives in defence of this nation and our ideals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why am I making all these points? I am making them because of their type of employment and their requirements for mobility, of which they have no say. I am pleased to see women serving in the defence forces. It is not unusual for both husbands and wives to have a career in the ADF. Posting becomes even more difficult in that situation. They are required to be mobile. They should have access to decent housing. I am very pleased that what was a scandal is being rectified. I have made the point that the defence subcommittee is really delighted to see progress being made in this respect in a very bipartisan way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with one of the recent changes that the government has made as far as the ADF is concerned, which is in the area of additional family payments. I think the ADF provides unique occupations. A housing rental subsidy is an absolutely fundamental aspect of ADF employment. As I say, Defence Force personnel do not have a choice as to where they serve; they are posted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really unfortunate that, when it comes to additional family payments, people are now suffering in the ADF. More ridiculously, it is the only government family payment that is being implemented on the basis of a person's STD area code. For example, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Snowdon) represents the Northern Territory. Those living in one part of Darwin get one allowance while those living in another part of Darwin get a lesser allowance. So two people of the same rank and seniority in the same occupation doing the same thing are receiving different money. </PARA>

My good friend the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) highlighted this problem to me. Frankly, I do not have any Defence Force bases in my electorate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This bill seeks to amend section 35 of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, which deals with the calculation of the interest rate contained in the agreement between the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank relating to the provision of subsidised housing loans for members of the Australian Defence Force. Clause 3 of the amendment aims to amend section 35 by removing the prohibition on revoking or varying subclause 5.15 of the agreement between the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank. This will enable the adjustment of interest rates applicable to the defence home loans assistance scheme in order to allow ADF members to take advantage of the latest trends in home loans. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Chifley said before, on Anzac Day we are reminded of the contribution that our defence forces have made to this nation. I certainly had the great pleasure of participating in it in my electorate and had the privilege to represent the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the dawn service in Brisbane. The services were very well attended. Anzac Day services appear to be more and more well attended on these days, particularly by younger people. It was amazing to see so many young people in Brisbane attending the services on Anzac Day&mdash;it was a glorious morning&mdash;at that early hour. For those reasons, I am always pleased to have the opportunity to support our defence people in any way in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I return to the housing question. I do not think very many people would disagree when I say that the defence home loans assistance scheme has made the goal of home ownership more readily accessible to ADF families. For the benefit of honourable members unfamiliar with the operations of DHLAS, it was set up by this government in 1985 to provide subsidised home loans to eligible members of the ADF who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. ADF members who joined prior to this date are covered under a previous scheme for defence housing loans. There has been assistance given, very much through a bipartisan approach, for many years to assist people in the defence area in the housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aims of the current scheme are to attract ADF personnel, to encourage home ownership during service life as a cost effective alternative to rental assistance and to assist in the re-integration of ADF personnel into the community on return to civilian employment. Under DHLAS, members of the ADF who have served a minimum of six years are eligible to receive a subsidy on a home loan of between $10,000 and $40,000, the amount of the subsidy being 40 per cent of the average monthly interest payable calculated on the loan and being for a 25-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsidy is payable for a period equal to the number of years of service completed after a six-year qualifying period. The subsidy is generally available for a maximum of 20 years. Special rules apply for certain groups of ADF personnel depending on where their service has been. For example, those involved in operational service do not have to serve the six-year qualifying period. Those who served in the Gulf War in operational service also have a minimum 16-year entitlement to the subsidy. Similar special provisions also exist for members of the Defence Force who have served in Somalia, Cambodia or the former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loans available under DHLAS are provided by the National Australia Bank under an agreement contained in the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990. Since this agreement was finalised there have been a number of changes to the range of housing loans available as a result of the strong growth in the economy and sound policy decisions of this government. These new home loan products have included the appearance of discounted rates for the initial period of a home loan. Unfortunately, subclause 5.15 of the agreement between the National Australia Bank and the Commonwealth in the act cannot be varied at present, meaning that no account of the new trends in home loans can be taken into account when calculating the interest on rates applicable for defence home loans assistance scheme loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of subsidy payable to the National Australia Bank under the agreement is calculated in accordance with subclause 5.15 and at present is based on the lower of two figures. The first is the average of the variable rate offered by the five largest banking groups that provide home loans, with loans provided before 1 April 1986 where the maximum interest rate payable is capped and loans with a fixed interest rate for over 12 months excluded. The second is the lowest home loan rate provided by the National Australia Bank, with loans with a fixed interest rate for over 12 months excluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These terms of the agreement reflected the conditions in the lending market that prevailed at the time when the agreement was made. At that time, interest rates were high and fixed term loans were available with a lower interest rate than the general variable rate. Now, due to the strong growth in the economy, and in the housing sector in particular, there are perceptions in the community that interest rates may rise, so at present fixed interest rate home loans have higher rates than variable loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of discounted rates for an introductory period to new borrowers combined with the wording of subclause 5.15 mean that the rate of interest used to determine the amount of subsidy payable to the National Australia Bank is based on the discounted rate offered for introductory periods, as this is the lowest rate offered by the National Australia Bank. This rate is used for all home loans provided under the DHLAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the explanatory memorandum indicates, this will result in reduced payments by the Commonwealth which are estimated to total $300,000 per year. This does not reflect the intention of the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank at the time the agreement was made, so I am glad to say that the Commonwealth and the National Australia Bank have agreed to change the way in which the interest rate is calculated for the purposes of the subsidy. To allow for this, section 35 of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 needs to be amended to allow a change to subclause 5.15. Clause 3 of this amendment legislation seeks to do this by amending section 35 of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The welfare of the members of our defence forces and their families, particularly the RAAF, is one of my important concerns. The amendments to the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act will provide much needed help for ADF families in purchasing a home. The current level of home ownership in the ADF is estimated to be less than 25 per cent. This has been attributed to factors affecting ADF families, such as constant transfers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chifley referred earlier to the mobility factor and the likelihood of disruption to the schooling of children in ADF families caused by frequent moving. I believe that problem in the schooling area needs constant addressing by both the Commonwealth and the states. Having equity between our schooling systems is raised with me frequently by defence people, particularly the wives and mothers, who are the ones who always have the biggest problem in handling the children's educational problems. It is for these reasons that I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent times the Commonwealth has put a big emphasis on housing for our defence people. In my own electorate there has been a huge influx of capital&mdash;up to $30 million&mdash;in moving defence people into a new housing estate. I hope that in the near future the minister will have the opportunity to visit that new estate. It is going particularly well and it is a great credit to the defence people themselves who have put these matters forward to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence Housing Authority is a very effective operation that this government developed. It manages those new housing estates extremely well. It is providing much needed, better quality housing than was available in the past. It is a very expensive area, but I believe that, because of the impact the mobility factor has on defence people, moving around from time to time does create extra problems for them. Having previously worked in the banking industry, an occupation in which I was subject to transfer&mdash;although it was only within the state and nowhere near the extent to which our defence people are moved&mdash;I do have some sympathy for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us brings further assistance in recognising the changing interest rates in the market and addresses some problems. I am sure defence people will welcome it. For some time the principal impediment to home ownership in the ADF has been the inability to accumulate a sizeable deposit because they are paying rent all the time. The defence home loans assistance scheme certainly helps those people. I am particularly pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to support these amendments to the act. I commend them to the House. I am pleased that those opposite are lending their support. I believe that if there is one area where we should have a bipartisan approach it is the welfare of our defence personnel. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1994 comes about as a result of initiatives taken last year in the 1993 budget and has to do with the changes of excise levied on avgas and avtur, which are used for the operations of general aviation aircraft and of pure jet passenger aircraft in Australia. It is proposed in this legislation to reduce the excise of avgas from O.25456c per litre to 0.22443c per litre, which gives an overall reduction of about 3.013c per litre, effective from 1 July last year. This has been part of an ongoing process by the government. It partly had to do with the arrangements under the airport local ownership scheme, whereby local airports were handed over by the Commonwealth to local councils and local organisations to undertake their operation, leaving the Commonwealth government free of that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process is now completed. This obviously has given the opportunity to reduce those sums on the cost of avtur and avgas. However, there were also some changes in the cost recovery arrangements for the provision of firefighting services by the Civil Aviation Authority and, similarly, with the provision of meteorological services by the Bureau of Meteorology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the industry has welcomed those moves. However, this budget initiative last year also proposed to increase the excise payable on avgas by 0.264c per litre and, for the first time, introduced excise of 0.264c per litre on avtur. Part of the idea of this was to meet the government's requirement&mdash;which it announced in the 1991 budget&mdash;of looking towards cost recovery in the provision of safety services by the Civil Aviation Authority. The reductions in the level of duty relating to the changes to the ALOP, the firefighting services and meteorological services are quite unexceptional, but the increase in the rate of duty on avgas and the new duty on avtur to fund aviation safety are frankly more controversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the government will continue to fund 50 per cent of these costs up to a limit of $22.8 million a year, while the phased-in cost recovery program is due to commence from September 1993. This has been a bit of an ongoing feast because it was hoped that the full cost recovery would be completed by 1 July 1995. However, there was such uproar and discontent within the aviation industry over the government's original proposal that it had to be withdrawn. I think it is true to say that, within the aviation industry as a whole, there are some concerns about what is happening within this piece of legislation. The general view within the aviation circles is that the government has not been prepared to meet the costs of setting up safety standards and ensuring compliance, and there is some objection to the fact that the industry is expected to meet half the cost of these services. However, I think it is true that, if we are going to go along that path, the bill is a reasonable method of recovering those moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has expressed some concern that the method being used is not based on a fee for service and that the process places no obligation on the Civil Aviation Authority to maximise the efficiencies of its operation. The industry also complains that the costs are not identifiable and that any decline in the level of compliance will increase surveillance costs. It believes that these costs will have to be borne to a disproportionate extent by the more diligent operators, especially the scheduled airlines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do have a philosophical argument as to how the safety requirements of the CAA should be funded, but the one thing that is coming through is that there is certainly a state of confusion within the aviation industry as to just how far the government is prepared to go and what is happening in the Civil Aviation Authority's administration of these procedures. In recent weeks, we have seen examples of what can happen if we are not absolutely sure and correct in making these particular regulations appropriate and up to date for the times. I cite as one example the incident that happened on 24 April, when a DC3 charter aircraft made a forced landing into Botany Bay. Thank goodness there was no loss of life, but that could have been a very serious accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is even more frightening are reports that appeared in today's press that no air safety regulations governed the operation of that particular DC3's flight from Sydney to Norfolk Island. Over recent years, there have been provisions within aviation regulations to cover the flight of two-engine aircraft across oceans. There have always been rules and regulations that aircraft flying over water should be within a one-hour range of an alternative landing field. It would have taken that particular DC3 about seven hours to fly from Sydney to Norfolk Island. Obviously, the entire flight is over water and that must raise some concern as to just what is happening in the overall administration of the safety provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that, while most aircraft built after 1968 would be covered by the aviation safety regulations, those regulations would not apply in the case of the DC3. We can argue that the DC3 has a tremendous safety record and is still one of the most reliable aircraft flying in the skies today. If we go back over the history of the administration of Australian aviation, we see that a DC3 was never allowed to operate to Norfolk Island. Back in those piston days, Qantas used to provide the service with a DC4, which was a four-engine aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem from the best of our investigations that there is absolutely no provision there to cover such a situation. It was interesting to see that a spokesman for the CAA came out and said that, had there been an application for that particular flight to be made to Norfolk Island, it may well not have been granted. I suppose that is all right in hindsight, but the fact is that that flight took off with 25 people on board to go to Norfolk Island as part of the Anzac Day ceremony proceedings there and did not get much further than the end of the runway in Botany Bay before it was forced to turn back and make that remarkable landing at the end of the new third runway complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the industry is saying that we have reached a situation in Australia where there must be some direction as to how we handle all areas of air safety regulation and, in particular, aircraft over 20 years of age. Just last weekend there was another incident near Maitland that was even more tragic than the forced landing of the DC3. A Tiger Moth built in the 1920s crashed in front of quite a crowd of onlookers. Nobody would deny that the vintage aircraft business is a most appealing one and has great public support, but we have to make absolutely sure that every conceivable measure is taken to ensure the safe operation of a lot of those vintage aircraft. We are seeing more and more of them being used in Australia. A number of them are being used in joy flights as part of the tourist infrastructure around Australia, and they will continue to be used while that particular operation takes off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think two other major air incidents have probably been very much in our focus at the moment: the crash of what I suppose can literally be called a mail charter off Sydney a couple of months ago, in which an ageing aircraft was involved, and the horrendous Monarch Air Services crash in southern New South Wales. My colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) will be making some comment about that when he addresses this legislation a little later in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now reached a stage in the administration of aviation in Australia where some tough decisions have to be made and some real leadership has to be given as to just how far we are going to go to ensure the safety of passengers and pilots alike, especially in relation to aircraft more than 20 years old. It is obvious that we have not got those provisions in place. It is something that must be addressed pretty soon. I would hope that the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), who has been in that portfolio for some time now, has the intestinal fortitude to take on the Civil Aviation Authority to make sure that those regulations are brought up to date and that we do have regulations that cover the entire operation of these aircraft around Australia. This will ensure that the tremendous reputation that we have enjoyed in Australia as a leader in aviation safety is not going to be prejudiced in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition parties have no real objection to this bill. We do waive the fact that the industry is not completely happy with the method of collection. We understand that there is yet more legislation to come in on a customs tariff bill which will further extend the increases in these aviation costs and lead further down the track to the self-funding of aviation safety in Australia. The opposition will not oppose this bill but we warn the government that something must be done very soon to ensure that the administration of civil aviation in Australia, especially the safety components, is up to its usual world standard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, which gives effect to excise tariff proposals Nos 2 and 3 of 1993. Excise tariff proposals are an area for the aficionados, but they do reflect important policy in other areas. I think that an overview of those important policy areas is important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, it is an unusual bill as it proposes both an increase and a decrease in the same measure at the same time, and that of itself is worthy of comment. Honourable members would be aware that excise is a duty or a tax levied on goods which are produced inside Australia in contrast to customs duty which is levied on imported goods. Honourable members would be aware that the constitution vested the Commonwealth with the power to collect duties of excise on locally produced goods, such as beer, spirits and tobacco, which were commonplace at the turn of the century. In more recent times, petroleum products have been added to the list which we now find in the tariff excise schedule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, excise duties are payable on consumables such as beer, spirits, tobacco, refined petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, crude oil. I refer to crude oil because that is found in the North West Shelf in my own state of Western Australia. In the normal course of events, excise duty is adjusted regularly in line with the CPI. That ensures that, in real terms, the Commonwealth's revenue receipts keep pace with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That part of the tariff exise schedule which is important to this particular bill falls in the area of refined petroleum products. A range of refined petroleum products fall to be considered, two of which are dealt with in this particular measure. Refined petroleum products relevant to excise tariffs include motor gasoline; automotive diesel oil; industrial diesel fuel; marine diesel fuel; lighting kerosene; power kerosene; heating and fuel oil, the two with which this particular measure is concerned&mdash;aviation gasoline, or avgas, and aviation turbine kerosene, or avtur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imported refined petroleum products attract customs duty at the same rate as that which applies to the equivalent locally produced excisable product. As far as Australian refined petroleum products are concerned, there is a range of refineries in Australia. The one which is important to Western Australia's economy and industrial base is the BP refinery in Kwinana. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to the budget papers. It was said to me on the occasion of my entry to this place that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS> of members of the House of Representatives is in many respects the budget papers. I think that is right. I refer to chapter four of Budget Paper No. 1 from last year's budget. At page 4.19 there are two columns headed `Outcomes' and `Estimates'. If we look at taxation revenue, we find that in 1992-93 we raised $9.2 billion by way of sales tax and that we raised just over $7.3 billion by way of excise duty&mdash;and this can be found under the heading `Petroleum products, crude oil and liquefied petroleum gas'&mdash;and under the heading of `Other', we raised $2.3 billion. They are large figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put the revenue effect of this particular measure in context, we need to move on to the detailed tabulation of excise duty. Table 11 on page 4.31 contains a breakdown of the 1992-93 collection as far as excise duty is concerned. Under the heading `Petroleum products' we find three breakdowns: `Motor spirit', which raised just under $4.5 billion; `Diesel', which raised just over $2.5 billion; and `Other', which raised $89 million. The `Other' is particularised to include aviation gasoline, aviation turbine fuel, fuel oil, heating oil and kerosene. So in this area excise duty has raised about $89 million, and that includes more than avgas and aviation turbine; it also includes fuel oil, heating oil, kerosene and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When dealing with policy, one often looks to the revenue side, as I have just done, but it is equally important&mdash;if not more important&mdash;to look at outlays. Page 3.149 of Budget Paper No. 1 considers transport outlays. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite some fluctuations between years, there has been a significant downward trend in air transport outlays over the ten years to 1993-94, principally as a result of the Government's policy of commercialising its involvement in aviation operations through the establishment of FAC and the CAA . . . In respect of the underlying trend over the forward years . . . outlays are expected to decline by 21.7% in real terms, principally because of reduced payments to the CAA for safety regulatory functions and the Commonwealth withdrawing from its involvement in civil airports not owned by the FAC.</PARA>
<PARA>We are beginning to get to the heart of the matter in terms of the policy approach which is behind this particular measure. Under the heading `Air Transport' on page 3.152, a range of significant comments is worth drawing attention to. The section reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's aviation policies aim to promote the operation of safe, secure, efficient and competitive air services within, to and from Australia. To foster increased competition, the Government has: deregulated the domestic aviation market (ending the two airline policy); commercialised its involvement in aviation operations through the establishment of the FAC and the CAA; enabled Australian carriers other than Qantas Airways Ltd to compete on international routes; allowed Qantas to operate domestically; and announced moves directed towards achieving a single aviation market with New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of a particular measure that is directly relevant to the bill before the House, it makes reference to the aerodrome local ownership plan. That section reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced its intention in the 1990-91 Budget to transfer the remaining Commonwealth (non FAC) aerodromes to local ownership and to encourage local authorities to assume full financial responsibility for airports previously jointly funded by the Commonwealth under the ALOP. To facilitate the program of transfers and withdrawals, the Government has provided transfer or withdrawal grants (to bring airports to good condition on transfer) and one-off capitalised subsidies to smaller, remote communities (to assist in meeting future operating costs of these aerodromes).</PARA>
<PARA>The other section relevant to this particular measure relates to the area of air safety. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government announced its intention in the 1992-93 Budget to achieve 50% cost recovery of the CAA's safety standard setting and surveillance functions by 1 July 1995. The Government will continue to fund 50% of these costs up to a limit of $22.8m a year. Phased recovery of the balance of safety standard setting and surveillance costs from the aviation industry will commence from 1 September 1993. The CAA is moving toward (by 1994-95) full recovery of the costs incurred in implementing safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following section is then directly relevant to the bill before the House. The heading is `Avgas and avtur duty paid to the Civil Aviation Authority'. Here we have the heart of the policy which drives the excise proposals currently before the House. The section reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94, all of the duty on aviation gasoline will be appropriated to the CAA to contribute towards recovering the costs of enroute and terminal navigation services where no specific charges apply. From 1 September 1993, the avgas duty will also include a component to assist in recovering the cost of the CAA's safety standard setting and surveillance functions in 1993-94. Avtur duty will also be appropriated to the CAA from 1 September 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commencing 1 July 1993, the avgas duty was reduced by two cents per litre to reflect the introduction of user charging by the Bureau of Meteorology and the CAA (for rescue and fire fighting services).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the impending completion of the aerodrome transfer program, a further one cent per litre . . . of avgas duty was removed from 1 July 1993. (This amount was previously retained by the Commonwealth to offset the costs of operating and maintaining Commonwealth (non FAC) airports and the Commonwealth's contribution to the ALOP.)</PARA>
<PARA>So in the budget papers we find the policy heart of these, in a sense, technical proposals in the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill which are before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to deal specifically with the bill which implements, as I have mentioned, two excise tariff proposals. Excise tariff proposal No. 2 (1993) was made public and gazetted on 19 August 1993 and excise tariff proposal No. 3 (1993) was dealt with similarly on 30 August 1993. Both those proposals emerged shortly after the budget of that year on 17 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Excise tariff proposal No. 2 proposes a decrease in the rate of excise duty payable on gasoline for use in aircraft&mdash;avgas&mdash;by just over 3c per litre, and that decrease takes effect from 1 July 1993. As the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) makes clear, there are two sources for this decrease: firstly, as I have referred to by way of the budget papers, the government's decision to transfer Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership; and, secondly, a portion of the excise duty collected on avgas is to be used by the CAA to perform services on behalf of the aviation industry, namely, provision of safety through firefighting services and meteorological services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the carve up of those measures, of the just over 3c per litre reduction contained in the bill, just over 1c per litre is attributable to the aerodrome transfer program; 0.7c per litre is attributable to firefighting services; and a reduction of 1.3c per litre is attributable to the cost of meteorological services provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. Whereas the CAA used to pay for those services, they will now be directly charged to airport operators. That outlines the decrease in the rate of excise duty payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase is found in excise tariff proposal No. 3 where it is proposed to increase the rate of excise duty on avgas and avtur for use in aircraft by 0.264c per litre. As the budget papers make clear, this increase is to take effect from 1 September. Again, as the parliamentary secretary's second reading speech makes clear, the purpose of this increase is to enable the CAA to recover part of the costs of air safety regulation from the aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 August, the day after the budget, the then minister for transport and communications announced that the government had decided that the cost of aviation safety standard setting and surveillance would be jointly met by the government and the aviation industry. The government would meet 50 per cent of the costs up to an index limit of $22.8 million. The cost recovery would commence in the 1993-94 financial year and would be phased in over a two-year period. The minister announced that the government had also decided that full cost recovery for the implementation of standards would continue to be phased in by 1994-95. The minister indicated that the proposed increase in 1993-94 was an interim measure as the CAA was currently in the process of developing a long-term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation. That is reflected in his media statement of August 1993. I draw the attention of the House to the final two paragraphs of that statement which read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Safety regulation cost recovery arrangements for 1994/95 and beyond will depend on a funding strategy to be developed over the coming months. The CAA will examine the implications for the industry of possible mixes of charges and aviation industry specific taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister stressed that the CAA's funding strategy will be developed in close consultation with all sectors of the aviation industry and he encouraged their active participation.</PARA>
<PARA>That meets the point of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who spoke before me and who indicated that certain sections of the industry might not be overwhelmed by the increases in avgas and avtur. The opportunity is there&mdash;this has come from a couple of the large airlines&mdash;for them to be involved in that ongoing process to bring about a final conclusion to the government's proposal for long-term funding arrangements commencing in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the reduction in the excise duty is essentially twofold. Firstly, there is the conclusion of the aerodrome local ownership plan which has seen the successful transfer of over 230 local aerodromes around Australia to local owners, which gives local communities a major opportunity to develop local infrastructure and to cater for their specific local requirements. Secondly, the reduction in the duty helps ensure the more efficient delivery of services and more appropriate charging arrangements for the services that the CAA provides. Those reductions will be well received by the aviation industry and by the ultimate beneficiary&mdash;the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made the point through reference to the budget papers that behind these excise proposals there have been some major policy changes. Aviation reform has, without question, been one of the federal government's great achievements in the area of micro-economic reform. The net economic benefits of airline deregulation&mdash;with record numbers of passengers, increased tourism and trade and lower air fares&mdash;are well established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect of that micro-economic reform to which attention is not often drawn is the cost savings achieved by the CAA which have contributed to a more competitive aviation industry. Although, in a sense, it might be self-serving, the CAA itself by way of a media statement in June 1993 announced reductions in airway charges of over $100 million in real terms to the aviation industry. That continued a trend of lower charges by the CAA to the industry since its formation, which I think is a worthy achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA has indicated that it will continue to seek efficiencies in the delivery of services to the industry. It will do that in a manner which the government believes is appropriate, namely, that services provided ought to be essentially based on the notion of user pays and that that notion, together with the deregulation of the aviation industry which the government has effected, will ensure that what in many respects was regarded as a regulated moribund industry has had the opportunity of growing in the course of the last decade and has the opportunity now to flourish even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude where I started. The excise tariff proposals are very much in the nature of proposals before this House for aficionados but they do very much reflect major policy changes which have come before. I have no hesitation in welcoming the indication by the opposition that it proposes to support these measures and I have no hesitation in wholeheartedly endorsing the measures and supporting them in this the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to talk about the air safety regulation aspect of the Export Tariff Amendment Bill and I do so with the full knowledge of my colleague the shadow minister for aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). I will talk in particular, as he has foreshadowed, about the Monarch Air air crash that took place last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 June last year a Monarch Airlines Piper Chieftain VH-NDU crashed at Young in New South Wales, killing all seven people on board. All the passengers were known to me and were, in the main, my constituents. I later learned that Monarch Air was a disaster waiting to happen. It was technically bankrupt and had to resort to irregular methods to obtain fuel and purchase spare parts. It had consistently breached civil aviation regulations over a number of years and was flying NDU with its autopilot illegally removed at the time of the accident. Essential instruments on the pilot's panel had been removed, making it extremely dangerous for the aircraft to be flown. The plane was flown by a casually engaged pilot and an unpaid co-pilot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, Monarch Air had at least twice been the subject of a recommendation within the Civil Aviation Authority to be grounded. The latest of these was less than two months prior to the accident, for serious safety breaches involving the very plane that crashed and involving the very instrument that it seems likely was instrumental in the cause of the crash. Not 1c of compensation to the families of these victims has been paid by the insurance company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me start by saying that Monarch Air could only be described as a shonky operator with a track record that should have set off alarm bells throughout the Civil Aviation Authority. Those alarm bells did not ring because there is a culture operating in the Civil Aviation Authority that puts the safety of passengers second and the commercial interests of the airline operator first. My reason for saying this is that Monarch repeatedly failed to observe air safety regulations and was known throughout the industry for this. It was twice recommended for grounding, yet the CAA let it fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A clear example of this can be seen in the details of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation's interim report on the crash. It found important instruments rendered inoperative by the removal of the autopilot for service on 31 May 1993. This is a very serious matter. However, that is not all of the story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 April 1993 a ramp check revealed a number of violations and four serious breaches were found of Monarch's aircraft. Following the ramp check, the recommendation was that Monarch Air should be asked to show cause why its air operators certificate should not be varied, suspended or cancelled. However, the airworthiness inspectors could do no more than recommend that the operator be grounded. The actual delegation to do so rested with the flight operations manager. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no such decision was taken by the regional flight operations manager, Maurie Baston, which seems extraordinary, given that the aircraft had continued on the next stage of its scheduled service that same day with five passengers on board, despite the aircraft breaching safety regulations. I have since learnt that, no matter how serious a breach, a recommendation to ground an operator never seems to be acted upon by flying operations managers. In fact, an airworthiness inspector who recommended such an action against Western Airlines&mdash;which thankfully closed down last year&mdash;operating out of Wagga Wagga and who argued the point when the recommendation was rejected is now sidelined within the authority for his actions. On 2 May 1993 a special audit of Monarch Air was recommended within the CAA because Monarch was operating without the coverage of a licensed airworthiness maintenance engineer. This is also a serious infraction of the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At each point, action should have been taken to ensure that obvious habitual offenders were brought to book, but CAA's emphasis seems to have been on keeping them in the air. It is dangerous in any area of transport where lives are at stake to be giving second chances&mdash;and this is especially so in passenger aviation. But this was much more than Monarch's second chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the facts that my FOI request has confirmed is that Monarch Air was already identified as a serious offender by November 1991. The maintenance register for a newly acquired aircraft was amended without authorisation by Monarch's manager, Richard MacLean&mdash;on his own admission&mdash;to include regular public transport. The very same regional flying operations manager, Maurie Baston, who declined to act on the recommendation to ground Monarch in April 1993, was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that occasion also a CAA airworthiness inspector recommended that Monarch's air operators certificate be suspended or cancelled until its standards for airworthiness maintenance were satisfactory. Despite the admission by the manager of Monarch Air, Richard MacLean, that he fraudulently wrote additional words on the maintenance register and the recommendation to ground Monarch, the CAA's response was to sit on its hands. Monarch was given a deadline of 29 November 1991 to convince the CAA that it was capable of satisfactory maintenance control in accordance with its air operators certificate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, by 29 November eight items of non-compliance with maintenance requirements were listed against Monarch&mdash;but, amazingly, Monarch continued to operate, despite a growing number of complaints about its operations made to the CAA and to the New South Wales Air Transport Council. How many times did it have to be told? Here we have two documented examples of how Monarch had breached the safety requirements resulting in recommendations from airworthiness inspectors to close it down, yet senior management refused to act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monarch's precarious financial situation was also brought to the attention of the CAA and the New South Wales Air Transport Council. In 1991 Monarch Aviation Pty Ltd, the then owner of Monarch Air, showed a shareholders deficiency of $789,059. Monarch's reputation for its inability to pay ensured that it was unable to obtain fuel or spare parts on credit and had to pay cash or resort to measures such as having agents pay for fuel purchased on its behalf from the takings for ticket sales. This situation led to Monarch flying without sufficient fuel because it could not buy it at many airports. It ran out of fuel on at least one occasion that I am aware of and made an emergency landing at Hoxton Park in early 1993 with a full load of passengers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monarch's bankrupt status also led to habitual overloading and the industry was rife with stories of Monarch overloading by 200 to 300 kilograms as a matter of course. One pilot refused to fly an overloaded Monarch Chieftain with nine passengers, resulting in Monarch's chief pilot, Brad Wilson, angrily calling in a second aircraft to carry the passengers' baggage. The pilot's service with Monarch was terminated shortly after that incident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a Monarch scheduled service to Bathurst a pilot refused to fly on safety grounds, causing an overnight stop. On this occasion he invoked the anger of Monarch's management, despite the fact that the passengers were in agreement with the pilot's decision and were content to stay overnight. It was six months before the pilot was given another flight. I have documented evidence of a case where Monarch solved overbooking by putting two adolescent schoolgirls in the same seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response of the CAA to complaints about Monarch's insolvency was, `Well, insolvency of an operator is not a prime concern of the CAA.' However, Monarch's insolvency was obviously adversely affecting the safety of its operations. The CAA's prime responsibility is to ensure the safety of air operations&mdash;yet it excludes an operator's financial situation from its assessment of whether the airline operator has the capacity to carry out proper maintenance and maintain proper flying procedures. It was apparent in 1991 that Monarch Air was a problem, that it was broke and was also breaking safety requirements. Somehow or other, that did not seem to concern the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States the financial viability of an airline is a mandatory criterion in approval for its entry into the market. The same applies in the United Kingdom. However, that does not seem to be part of the criteria applied by the CAA in Australia. Finding out just what criteria the CAA did consider in its decision to allow Monarch to continue operating proved to be difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a response to my FOI request for information regarding recommendations made by officers of the CAA for the suspension of Monarch's air operators certificate, the CAA legal counsel identified a limited number of documents. Despite its best attempts to hide information through my FOI request, the FOI claim proved that the documents which were already in my possession were correct and that the CAA's knowledge of Monarch Air's consistently unsatisfactory operations was also correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1993 nothing had changed about Monarch Air, except that it had gone through an amazing number of nominal changes of ownership through an elaborate paper trail of two-dollar companies designed to hide its ultimate ownership and protect it from the consequence of its irresponsibility, but still with the same person as the ultimate owner after each change. The paper trail finally led to Mr Greg Scarf, a one-time and present-day director of Aviation Operations Ltd. Mr Scarf's ultimate ownership of Monarch&mdash;throughout its history from 15 December 1989 and his directorial responsibility at the outset when Monarch was setting up the shabby operations that would characterise it&mdash;is indisputable. But after the crash Monarch's owner, Greg Scarf, simply shut up Monarch's flying operations, with seven people dead. The paper trail of ownership gave the insurers a way of wriggling out of their liability and ensured that the actual owners of this aviation operator with its appalling reputation go scot-free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the people responsible for Monarch there are no repercussions for their gross violations of aviation regulations. The consequences of their activities are being carried by the families of the victims. The CAA's airworthiness inspectors are quite properly recommending that operators in contravention, or in the case of Monarch in repeated contravention, of the very regulations on which aviation safety depends are grounded, but those inspectors have been given no authority to do anything other than to recommend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The authority to act on that recommendation was given to the flight operations side of the CAA. Flight operations inspectors are pilots and are required to maintain their flying hours in order to be current licensed pilots. As a result they often become dependent on the very operators they are supposed to be regulating for access to flying time in order to maintain their licences. This leads to a situation where corruption is possible and indeed does take place. I have been told of how problems have been finessed where the operator offered free flying time in expensive aircraft to CAA inspectors in return for lenient treatment when a breach of regulations has been discovered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an in-built conflict of interest here. It is simply wrong that this club-like atmosphere can exist between regulator or policeman, as the CAA people are, and the air operators, the people they are supposed to regulate. By sidelining airworthiness criteria as the primary requirement for continued operation, the operator has become the client, whose commercial interests have become paramount, putting passenger safety into second place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through my investigations it became apparent that the Monarch crash was not the exception but was just the one where potential disaster was realised. My office has had many calls from people in the aviation industry, including pilots, who are very concerned that safety has become the poor relation. They tell me that there are many operators who regularly operate well below the safety margin and who are constantly risking the lives of their unknowing passengers. Operators are intent on keeping their planes in the air and earning fares. The risk is that the first things to go in that process are the stringent standards that the travelling public believe exist in the Australian aviation industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Monarch Air's NDU was co-piloted by a young man who, it is believed, was not working for pay but had been picked up on the spot and was flying so that he could notch up his hours and get experience with a commercial operator. I have also been told of pilots waiting at Bankstown to get a chance to fly a route&mdash;and not only not getting paid but having to pay the operator or someone in management to be allowed to do so. Under these circumstances, pilots are unlikely to be able to exercise the responsibilities that are demanded of them and will be very reluctant to take a stand and refuse to fly a plane, even when they know it has a defect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The penalties they suffer for exercising their responsibilities can be severe. A pilot flying for an operator, Seaview Aviation, which flies from the north of New South Wales to Lord Howe Island, claimed that he was sacked on the spot for refusing to fly a plane in which the autopilot was out, the same problem in the incident with the Monarch plane. Notwithstanding the pilot's notification of the defect to the operator, he claims that the pilot subsequently operated the plane unchanged and with no notation of the defect on its maintenance release. Moreover, according to local reports, the operator continually operates that aircraft overloaded. The CAA has been aware of the situation for some time and, once again, nothing has been done to stop that operator from risking the lives of the unwitting passengers despite a CAA airworthiness inspector's recommendation that the operator be grounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pilot has given me information detailing accidents in which he was involved caused by safety breaches by the operator for whom he worked, Blayney Airfarmers, an operator who also failed to report an accident after which repairs were done by a non-licensed engineer with unapproved materials. Although the pilot reported these circumstances and abuses, such as flying with tachographs disconnected, to the CAA flight operations manager, Mary O'Brien, and despite the fact that officers from the CAA had arranged to meet with him, they did not attend at the appointed time and have not followed this matter up at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other examples that time does not permit me to go into. It is clear from these cases that the Monarch air crash is simply the visible tip of a very large and potentially very destructive iceberg. The CAA has obviously fallen down in its prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuses. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that it is not using them. My constituents, through no fault of their own, flew in an aircraft that operated and that the CAA knew was likely to be operated in breach of air safety regulations and were the victims of a fatal accident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To make their families' pain and grief even greater, they seem to be denied access to insurance. The irony is that the very breaches of the regulations by the airline operator that led to the accident are being used as the escape from liability by the insurer. Insurers know that they can use such methods of evasion. Even if challenged in court, the legal challenge will be a long, stressful and costly experience for the claimants. Insurers apparently use every means to evade their liability and are unmoved by the distress of the families or victims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passengers on the Monarch aircraft assumed, as do most Australians, that they were covered automatically by insurance similar to the third party insurance that covers all travellers on the roads. That is not the case, however, and the plight of the families of the victims of the Monarch crash is not an isolated case. On 12 June 1992 another Piper crashed at Moorabool in central Victoria. Five people, including the pilot, were killed. The owner has had his insurance claim on the plane paid, but the insurance company&mdash;it happens to be the same one involved in the Young crash&mdash;is not only backing away from payment of the claims by the widows of the passengers but has not even responded to their correspondence. The families of the victims are suffering great deprivation, financial as well as emotional, and have been abandoned despite confirmation from the owner of the plane that he held insurance. The insurance company has not denied that a policy exists, but simply refuses to discuss it. Again, it is the victims' families that are placed last in the list of priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The families are given this low priority in the Air Navigation Act, which not only does not require that insurance be compulsory for these aviation operators at all but, even if insurance is taken out, also limits the liability of both operator and pilot for death or injury to $180,000. The CAA requires no proof of insurance before issuing an air operator's certificate for charter or for regular public transport. Although this is a requirement for registration by the New South Wales Air Transport Council, it need only be sighted on the first application and in practice need not be sighted from that day forward. This is an inequitable situation and demands correction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lot that needs to be done to put civil aviation on a proper footing in Australia. The Monarch crash and the information I have been given about other crashes and potential disasters lead to some inescapable conclusions. The CAA has clearly lost sight of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of air safety above all other considerations. Operators are permitted to continue carrying passengers even when it is obvious that their financial status will no longer enable them to carry out the required maintenance. Also, operators have taken advantage of the failure by the CAA to properly regulate air safety to take short cuts and to dodge expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These investigations also led me to conclude that Australians are unwittingly flying with third level operators, unprotected by proper safety regulation and unprotected by adequate insurance. It is an outrageous situation that must not be allowed to continue and I will be approaching the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) with the details of the cases I have discussed today and I will be proposing that he initiate an immediate investigation of the regulatory needs of civil aviation, especially at this level of operation, and of the adequacy of insurance protection to passengers when they travel with these operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the minister that the following measures are essential. The government must review the priorities of the Civil Aviation Authority. The government must investigate the association between flying operations inspectors and airline operators to ensure that no opportunity for corruption can occur. Viability must be included as a mandatory criteria when the Civil Aviation Authority is considering an air operator's certificate. The viability of a particular route should be a consideration before licensing more than one operator for a particular route. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Insurance arrangements should be changed so that unscrupulous insurance firms cannot weasel their way out of their obligations by claiming that the operator breached safety regulations, thus voiding the policy at the expense of the victims. Insurance should be compulsory for all air operators and checked regularly to ensure that it is up to date. The upper limit of liability of $180,000 should be lifted. Why is an injury or loss of a human life more valuable if it occurs in a motor accident than if it occurs in an aeroplane? The upper limit of $180,000 is a fraction of the compensation that motor vehicle accident victims receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People such as Greg Scarf and Richard MacLean must never again be allowed to operate an airline or an air charter service because they lack the required character, as proven by their operation of Monarch Air, and should not be placed in a position where they can put people's lives ahead of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people at CAA who refused to act on the recommendations to ground Monarch, made at least twice, should be brought to account and made to explain why it was that, despite two recommendations to ground Monarch and numerous incidents that should cause concern, they allowed Monarch to continue to fly. If these actions are not taken, we will see more people killed on commercial airlines. The crash of a DC3 at a Sydney airport last week shows how inadequate the CAA is and how lucky we are that more Australians have not gone to their graves, as my constituents did on 11 June last year at Young. I seek leave to table documents that add further to those claims. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), the honourable member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) for their contributions to this important debate. The main purpose of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is to incorporate excise tariff proposals Nos 2 and 3 into the Excise Tariff Act. Accordingly, the subject of the bill is quite narrow in dealing with these revenue matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to comment on some of the matters raised by honourable members during this debate. The honourable member for Fadden raised the matter of the recent crash of a DC3 into Botany Bay. In relation to the circumstances surrounding the crash of the DC3 referred to by the honourable member, including the regulatory framework for the particular flight that he referred to, I wish to assure him that this is subject to investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. I expect that, as a consequence of that investigation, the facts will emerge as to where the cause of the crash lay and whether or not any person or persons can be held to account for any acts of negligence that may be identified with respect to that particular flight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The details of the bill were outlined by me in my second reading speech on 9 February this year. Indeed, the honourable member for Perth has also at some length analysed the circumstances of the increase and decrease of these proposals. I make a couple of other observations with respect to the charges themselves. The first point to make is that the recovery of safety regulation costs from the airline industry through duty on avtur should be viewed in the context of the significant savings the Civil Aviation Authority has delivered to industry over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Airways charges were reduced by $109 million in 1993-94, following a decrease of $94 million in 1992-93. Because of the low rate of duty, the 1993-94 arrangements are not expected to result in any significant adverse financial impact on any particular aviation industry sector. I say this having regard to the comments made by Qantas and Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Perth has mentioned, the Civil Aviation Authority is developing a long-term funding strategy for aviation safety regulation, which will apply with effect from 1 July 1995. This process will involve extensive consultation with the aviation industry. Indeed, I am informed that the general aviation sector has indicated support for these measures contained in the bill. I acknowledge that there has been resistance from Ansett and Qantas against these particular measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me assure the House that the travelling public are the major beneficiaries of safety regulation, and fuel tax is a reasonable proxy for a direct tax on passengers. I know that Ansett and Qantas are strongly opposed to the introduction of additional industry taxes such as a passenger ticket tax. So I would be intrigued to know of the proposals, particularly by Ansett and Qantas, as to how these funds should be raised without being an impost directly on the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that the cost of applying aviation safety standards in Australia is in the order of $60 million annually. I believe, as would every honourable member of this House, that the maintenance of the highest aviation safety standards in this country is absolutely essential. In respect of the crash of the Monarch aeroplane referred to by the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), these matters are currently the subject of an investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. The issues raised by him are of serious concern. I would like to assure him that the matters raised by him in his contribution to this bill will be taken into account by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter I want to refer to is the issue of the tax itself. There has been a lot of discussion over a long period as to how these costs should be shared. I believe that there is consensus on both sides of the House that the cost sharing arrangements proposed in this bill and that are ongoing in the aviation industry have the general support of both sides of the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the economic issue, the safety implications and the impacts of the possible mixes of charges and industry specific taxes on the aviation industry, the CAA has engaged Andersen Consulting, assisted by Swedavia, which is an arm of the Swedish Civil Aviation Authority, to advise it in particular on the issues that I have just raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal aim of this legislation is to provide a real and enforceable deterrent to the sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and residents. It is unfortunate that a minority of Australian citizens and residents are now known internationally as major offenders in several Asian countries. They exploit the vulnerability of children in foreign countries where laws against child sexual abuse may not be as strict, or as consistently enforced, as in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill aims to ensure that cowardly crimes committed against children outside Australia which are not prosecuted in the country in which they were committed can be prosecuted effectively in Australia. The bill also focuses on the activities of those who promote, organise and profit from child sex tourism. Provided they operate from Australia, or have a relevant link with Australia, they too will be able to be prosecuted for their contribution to the abuse of foreign children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some may wonder why the Australian parliament should enact laws to protect foreign children from sexual abuse and ask why the foreign country should not protect its own children. It is true that the primary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation rests, as it should, with the countries where the children are exploited. The Asian countries which I have visited are indeed taking measures to do so but are confronted by social and economic factors which make their task difficult. They welcome any assistance in kerbing the trade in children's bodies that other governments can give. Some other countries have already enacted, or plan to enact, legislation similar to that which is now before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the fact that Australia is gaining an unenviable reputation in the world press on this issue, we also have international obligations to protect children, whatever their nationality. Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 17 December 1990, and this imposes an obligation to protect children, at both the national and the international level, from sexual exploitation and abuse. Australia played a key role in the development of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian government is committed to pursuing the aims of that convention. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, has been asked to prepare a draft protocol to the convention specifically addressing the problems of child prostitution and other forms of abuse and sexual exploitation of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in my address to the First World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights in Sydney on 4 July 1993, it is clear from the recent World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna that children's rights are high on the international agenda. That conference highlighted the need to develop effective and independent international machinery to ensure that abuses of children's rights are identified and that tangible measures are taken to remedy those abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill aims to achieve these ends by creating sexual offences, relating to conduct outside Australia, which will be punishable in Australia and offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism which may be committed in or out of Australia and will be punishable in Australia provided there is a relevant link with this country. All these offences will have substantial penalties, ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment, or correspondingly high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill should send a clear message to child sex abusers and those who profit from their activities that the government and the community condemn their behaviour and do not intend to tolerate it. The bill has the support of all Australian jurisdictions through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. State and territory jurisdictions not only support the Commonwealth measures but will enact any necessary or desirable supplementary legislation to close any perceived gaps and to ensure that the measures are effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill creates prescribed sexual offences committed overseas against children under the age of 16 and aggravated sexual offences where children are under 12 years. The prescribed sexual offences are:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are further offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. There are some aspects of the bill that I draw to your attention. The intention has been to strike the correct balance between the need to minimise the enforcement difficulties that always arise where overseas evidence is required, and which are exacerbated when child witnesses are involved, and the need to ensure that the rights of the defendant receive a similar degree of protection as would apply if the offence had been committed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation must be more than mere window-dressing. I am concerned to see that it is practically enforceable, as it must be if it is to have the deterrent effect for which I have aimed. However, while I am determined to achieve this, I will not do so by compromising the defendant's right to the protection of the usual rules of evidence and procedure&mdash;to the traditional rights, privileges and defences which would have applied if the conduct alleged had occurred within an Australian jurisdiction and not in a foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will inevitably be some differences in the procedural and evidentiary framework of these offences from that which applies to similar state and territory offences. These are needed to accommodate the international aspect of the enforcement process, but there are none which do not already occur in Australia in an age of increasing internationalisation of many offences, and none which will operate unfairly to the defendant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now outline the features of the bill which may call for further explanation, particularly as this subject matter, sexual offences, is unusual in a Commonwealth bill. The age of consent is the factor which creates the difference between the freedom to conduct one's personal life as one wishes and the commission of the criminal offence of child sexual abuse. On this point such offences are offences of strict liability, in this bill and in all Australian states and territories, whether code or common law jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within Australia, the age of consent varies among jurisdictions, and overseas the range of variability is even greater. The Convention on the Rights of the Child sets the age at 18 years. However, most Australian jurisdictions have chosen 16 as the appropriate age, and that is the age which I consider appropriate in the present circumstances. There is also some variation in Australia regarding the age at which an aggravated offence of child sexual abuse occurs. In most jurisdictions that age is 10 years. I have chosen 12 years as the age of a victim below which an aggravated offence is committed. My choice of that age was influenced by a proposed defence of mistaken belief in the age of a child&mdash;that is, a belief that the child was over 16 years&mdash;together with a  belief that the child consented to the relevant acts. I do not think it appropriate to extend that defence below 12 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that this means that an Australian might sexually abuse, overseas, a child of an age that, if the conduct had occurred in his or her home state in Australia, an offence would not have been committed or would not have been an aggravated offence. However, in my view, there is no more reason for legitimate grievance on the defendant's part than if his or her conduct had taken place in an Australian jurisdiction where similar age limits applied as are provided in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may be a convenient point to deal with the proposed defences, which have unusual features not duplicated in any Australian jurisdiction. The first is a defence of mistaken belief in the age of the child. It is available only in relation to offences involving children between 12 years and 15 years. Its first element is a belief that the child was 16 years or over. This, or its equivalent, is usually, though not always, the only element of the defence in Australia. Its second element is a belief that the child consented to sexual intercourse. In some Australian jurisdictions, a similar two-element defence is available at the upper level of the prohibited age range. The belief test, in both cases, is a subjective one, based on what the person actually believed, though in determining whether the person actually held that belief the jury is entitled to take into account whether the claimed belief is reasonable in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the belief in consent, the defendant's belief is negated if he or she knows that the child's consent was caused by any of the circumstances listed in proposed section 50CF of the bill, such as violence, threats of various kinds, coercion, or any form of intoxication or incapacity; nor is mere passivity on the child's part to be taken as grounds for a belief in his or her consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although unusual, in this legislation the requirement of a belief in consent is necessary to avoid an unacceptable result where a defendant satisfies the jury of his or her belief that the child was 16 years old or over&mdash;and under most Australian laws would, therefore, be entitled to an acquittal&mdash;but the evidence shows unequivocally that the child did not consent and that the defendant had no belief that the child did consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the conduct had occurred in an Australian jurisdiction, the person, though not guilty of a child abuse offence, would be convicted of rape. Under this legislation, he or she could only be acquitted of the offence charged. Any rape trial would have to take place in the country where the conduct occurred and would depend on a request from that country for extradition of the accused, which may not be forthcoming. It is simply not feasible for the present proposal to extend to the creation of an offence of rape in a foreign country. That would be way beyond its scope. So the element of belief in consent is the only way to avoid such anomalous results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second defence, which is available where the child is under, as well as over, the age of 12 years, is that of a valid and genuine marriage between the accused and the alleged victim. The defence extends below 12 years because marriage customs vary considerably throughout the world. I would not wish to exclude from its ambit any valid and genuine marriage, although I would expect such marriages with children under 12 years to be rare. This defence, too, has an unusual element: the requirement that the defendant satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, that a formally valid marriage is also genuine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This requirement is to avoid deliberate abuse of the availability of the marriage defence to defeat the legislation. Marriages celebrated in foreign countries where one of the parties is under 18 years are generally not recognised in Australia. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that an Australian citizen or resident who came to Australia from a foreign country, or whose parents did so, might return to that country to marry according to its customs. I have no intention, in multicultural Australia, of rendering any such person vulnerable to conviction for a criminal offence on returning to Australia. That would be an entirely different matter from simply not recognising the marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the formal validity of a marriage is proved, prima facie, by production of a marriage certificate. It would not be difficult, particularly in countries where poverty and corruption are widespread, for paedophiles to obtain marriage certificates which would preclude their conviction of child sexual abuse offences if the marriage defence did not place an onus on them to satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, of the genuineness of the marriage. Courts have some experience in dealing with a requirement for proof of genuineness of a marriage because it features in immigration law, which could similarly be circumvented by non-genuine marriages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of my concern that Australians from other ethnic backgrounds are not prejudiced by this legislation, I cannot accept that a genuine marriage alone should provide a complete defence if there is evidence that the child did not consent to sexual acts. The same belief in consent, and the same negating factors, will apply to this defence as to the mistaken belief in the age of the child. This is consistent with the policy behind Australian laws which do not condone rape within marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some may consider that the defences provided in the bill, placing both the evidential and the persuasive onus of proof on the defendant to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities that such a defence is made out, as being contrary to the principle that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. However, the offences are proved by the prosecution satisfying the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the prohibited acts with a child of the relevant age. The child's lack of consent or marital status are not elements of the offence. The defences are true defences providing a means of exculpation for the accused and are matters required to be proved to the civil standard and are matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. Therefore, it is appropriate for the onus of proving them to rest on him or her, rather than that having the prosecution forced to undertake the difficult task of proving negatives beyond a reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now move to the offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism. These offences are required because the usual ancillary offences of aiding and abetting, counselling, procuring and being knowingly concerned in the commission of a substantive offence would not suffice to catch the promoter, organiser or advertiser of a child sex tour. That is because those offences depend on the commission of a particular offence to which the promoter, organiser or advertiser would have to be directly and knowingly linked. This would not usually be possible when he or she is remote in time and place from any specific child sexual offence. Possibly the ancillary offence of incitement could be committed, since it does not require the actual commission of a particular, or indeed any, offence but the penalty for incitement is only 12 months imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that the intentional acts of encouraging or benefiting from the sexual abuse of defenceless children in foreign countries, whether or not any specific offence with a particular child is contemplated, must be prosecutable and must be punishable by a substantial penalty, in this case a maximum of 10 years imprisonment. This is an indictable offence and will attract the confiscation and forfeiture provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, which should provide a powerful deterrent to any business enterprises which have been profiting from knowingly facilitating child sex tours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There remain two more matters that I wish to mention. These relate to the conduct of the trial and arise from the difficulties that are associated with prosecuting offences committed outside Australia. I am determined that the legislation will provide every opportunity, consistent with fairness, for evidence to be made available to the jury, despite the fact that in many cases it will be evidence from a foreign country where records may not be kept in the same comprehensive manner as in Australia and where the ability of investigators and the court to use coercive powers to obtain evidence and to compel the attendance of witnesses is severely curtailed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is a provision which, where the age of a child cannot be determined by the usual means, allows the jury to estimate the age of the child, taking into account whatever evidence is available, such as the evidence of relatives and the child's appearance and demeanour. This is not without precedent. It is based on section 411 of the Crimes Act 1958 of Victoria. I would expect it to have the most relevance not in borderline cases where the defence of a mistaken belief in the age of the child would be expected to prevail but in cases where the child was obviously well within the prohibited range. It would serve the purpose of preventing an accused from evading punishment completely because of the lack of documentary evidence of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is the provision for the use of video link so that overseas evidence can be presented to a court in Australia. Video link has already been used effectively in major trials in Australia, including one of the war crimes trials. The legislation guides the judge in the use of the technology by providing two levels of relevant factors to be taken into account. The first level permits the judge to direct the use of video link if he or she is satisfied that the witness, who cannot be the defendant, is willing to give the evidence from outside Australia; that the facilities are available; and that it is in the interests of justice that the evidence be taken by video link. The second level requires the judge to direct the use of video link. He or she must do so if, in addition to a willing witness, other than the defendant, and the availability of technology, he or she is satisfied that the attendance of the witness in Australia would cause unreasonable expense or inconvenience, would cause the witness psychological harm or unreasonable distress, or would cause the witness to become so intimidated or distressed that his or her reliability as a witness would be significantly reduced and, in addition to those matters, is satisfied that it would not be contrary to the interests of justice to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these provisions strike the correct balance. The interests of justice remain the deciding factor, but the judicial discretion is guided to give maximum weight, consistent with those interests, to ensuring that the evidence of foreign witnesses is before the court in the most convenient and useful form. It is increasingly the trend in Australian jurisdictions to spare children who have been victims of sexual abuse the trauma and the ordeal of appearing in the witness box in the intimidating atmosphere of the court. Even in Australia, it is frequently the case that the jury views the child's examination and cross-examination by means of video. The fact that the child itself is in a distant country rather than in a nearby room may pose some problems for the court and for counsel that might not arise when the evidence is taken in close proximity to the courtroom but none, I believe, that cannot be overcome. My expectation is that the use of satellite and communications technology, where that is available, can be used to approximate conditions comparable to those which can already occur in some Australian jurisdictions. If, in a particular case, the judge forms the view that the use of video link would be contrary to the interests of justice, he or she is not compelled to direct its use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not anticipated that the bill will occasion any additional costs to the government. The costs of any prosecutions will come from the budgetary allocations for the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which will conduct investigations and prosecutions under the proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I might mention that earlier today I had the opportunity to have a brief discussion with the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), who raised with me the fact that the opposition was concerned that there would be an occasion for close examination of this bill by a committee of this House. This is an unusual procedure. In the past, this House has not been well disposed to that practice, but I have taken the opportunity on this occasion to have discussion with representatives of the Democrats in the Senate, who have indicated that it is not their intention to refer this matter to a Senate committee and the matter will be dealt with directly in the Senate without referral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances and in the circumstances of other discussions which I have had with the shadow Attorney-General which relate to the time scale so this bill will not be delayed, I propose at the conclusion of the second reading debate to seek leave to move for the suspension of standing orders to allow this bill to be placed before the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration and advisory report back to this House by 30 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I obviously will be very interested in the way in which that process operates. It is somewhat novel in this House. I think the goodwill of all those involved in the process will be a matter of considerable attention. There is a real community interest that this matter be proceeded with expeditiously and these important measures are brought into Australian legislation without delay. I am certain that the shadow Attorney-General will attend the deliberations of that committee with goodwill, as he has indicated to me in his discussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the proposed legislation achieves the challenging task of ensuring both enforceability and fairness in the prosecution process for offences committed overseas which are known to be difficult to prosecute even when committed in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 provides a needed step in the direction of preventing Australian citizens from exploiting children in other countries for sexual purposes. The bill is directed principally to activities in South-East Asia, and notably in Thailand and the Philippines. Regrettably, reliable statistics on the extent of the problem are not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a book to which I will refer later the number of child prostitutes worldwide is estimated at one million. The extent of the unreliability of information on the subject is provided by a further reference in the book to the fact that one survey has estimated that there are 10,000 children engaging in prostitution in Thailand while another survey suggests that there are 800,000. Even given the minimum numbers estimated, this is unacceptable to any civilised person or country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Thailand and the Philippines, at least, it is quite clear that some of the exploitation is undertaken by Australian citizens. The exploitation of children for sexual purposes in those countries by anybody is unacceptable to Australians. Indeed, the conduct of those who exploit children in this way is regarded by all reasonable persons as abhorrent, reprehensible and disgusting. The extent of the sexual exploitation of children overseas and the fact that Australians are involved are factors that must weigh heavily in determining that this parliament should act in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, legislative action by the Australian parliament is not supportable just because activities of Australians overseas would be a criminal offence if committed in Australia. This parliament does not regularly act to regulate the activities of persons outside the Australian jurisdiction, although there are precedents. Acts such as the Extradition Act 1988, the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 and the Crimes at Sea Act 1979 all relate to the activities of persons outside Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Generally, it will be for the government of the country where the offence is committed to take action. However, in this situation, a significant factor to consider is the practical ability of governments of the countries where the exploitation is occurring to take appropriate action. For instance, in Thailand, despite government determination to stamp out the problem, the incidence of the offences, their institutionalised nature and the limitation of resources make this difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia's assertion of sovereignty is justified in this situation because the main impact of the bill will be in countries whose governments have requested the introduction of such legislation. Significantly, the legislation is also quite consistent with Australia's obligations at international law. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990 and came into force on 16 January 1991. It provides that countries shall take multilateral measures to prevent, amongst other things, the exploitative use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is to be noted that the Commonwealth does not have a general constitutional responsibility in the area of criminal law. However, the bill is constitutionally authorised by the external affairs power, which allows the government to legislate with respect to matters occurring outside Australian territory that genuinely affect Australia's international relations. There must be a connection between Australia and the matters regulated. The nexus in the case of this bill is that the offences created are committed overseas by Australian citizens, Australian residents or companies incorporated in, or carrying on activities principally within, Australia. The implementation of the international obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child by means of domestic laws provides another constitutional peg through the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The coalition has had considerable difficulty with the use of the external affairs power by recent Labor governments, which have engaged in the practice of entering into international treaties and using those treaties to expand the reach of Commonwealth power. I am pleased to say that in this case the coalition has no such difficulties. As I have explained, constitutional validity is not dependent upon the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, although it provides an important additional justification for the introduction of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill is supported by the more fundamental reach of the external affairs power. Most significantly, the objects sought to be achieved by this bill are supported by the states and territories. The Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) mentioned in his speech the support for this legislation by the standing committee of Commonwealth and state Attorneys-General. It was considered at a meeting of SCAG in February this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The call for legislation of this nature has come from a number of quarters, including the National Conference on Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism held in 1993 and the inaugural World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights held in Sydney in July 1993. The United Nations Special Rapporteur to Australia made similar proposals. In addition, an active group named End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism has lobbied extensively for the introduction of this legislation. ECPAT now operates in 13 countries, including the Philippines and Thailand. Apart from Australia, there are ECPAT organisations within the United States, Canada and some European countries where tourists to Asia come from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With all those considerations in mind, in the coalition's view it is very appropriate for Australia to introduce legislation intended to deal with offences occurring overseas. Australia is by no means the first country to enact such legislation. Legislation preventing nationals from engaging in sexual activities with children in foreign countries has been passed by legislatures in Germany, Sweden and Norway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition offers full support for the objects of this bill. However, in our view, it is necessary that we get the legislation right. That involves determining whether the legislation is appropriately drafted in order to achieve its objectives. As the minister has pointed out, it is also fundamentally important that the basic rights of Australian citizens to the true rights of the presumption of innocence and to a fair trial are not overlooked in the pursuit of other worthwhile objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the coalition's view, there are a number of potential difficulties with the bill that I believe need to be examined in more detail. Some of these difficulties have been endorsed by those who are most supportive of the thrust of the bill. I acknowledge in this respect the assistance that has been received from Mr Richard Read, a prosecutor of the Queen of Victoria, and Professor David Lanham, the Sir Kenneth Bailey Professor of Law at the University of Melbourne. Both men are active supporters of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dwell on this point because I do not wish it to be suggested or thought even for a moment that well-intentioned substantive criticism of the contents of this bill constitutes a criticism of its fundamental purposes or a deflection from the pursuit of them. Demonstrative of the intention of commentators in this regard, Professor Lanham refers to a book by Mr Ron O'Grady, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Child and the Tourist</EMPHASIS>, which describes the nature and the extent of the sexual exploitation of children. Professor Lanham indicates that he read the book `with interest and anger'. He prefaced his written comments on the bill with this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a small contribution to the fight against the disgraceful exploitation of children, I offer some comments on the bill which I hope will make it more workable.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Read is also an active supporter of the government's action and already has been an active lobbyist for the legislation. Some of the comments I will mention are derived from comments made by Professor Lanham and by Mr Read. I believe that the full and constructively critical examination which I suggest should take place can be done effectively by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. As I indicated earlier, I applaud the minister's agreement that this is an appropriate course of action to take. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, before pointing to some of the difficulties, let me summarise some provisions of the bill. In general, the bill creates a range of offences involving sexual activity with children committed by Australian citizens or Australian residents outside Australia. As the minister has pointed out, it also creates offences relating to the organisational promotion of child sex tourism. The intention is to create specific offences which relate to children in two age groups. The first is those less than 12 years old and the second is those who are between the ages of 12 and 15; that is, not yet 16 years old. That second group would comprise 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds, 14-year-olds and 15-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The specific offences are, first, sexual intercourse with a child; secondly, inducing a child to engage in sexual intercourse; thirdly, sexual conduct involving a child, including acts of indecency; and, fourthly, inducing a child to be involved in sexual conduct in the presence of the offender, which also includes acts of indecency. An inclusive definition of sexual intercourse is provided in the legislation, and it is very wide in scope. The term `act of indecency' is not defined in detail. As would be expected, maximum prescribed penalties for offences against children under 12 years of age are greater than those against children in the older age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill provides for specific defences, including defences based on a belief about age and consent and a defence based on the existence of a valid genuine marriage and a belief about consent. Certain factors will operate to cause the defendant's belief about consent to be disregarded; for example, if the consent was caused by the effects of alcohol. The bill provides for the offence of benefiting from or encouraging other offences. This part of the bill is intended, it appears, to catch tour operators and organisers. The term `encourage' is defined widely and includes `organising an arrangement that facilitates an offence against this part'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The bill facilitates the taking of evidence by allowing evidence to be taken by video link. The bill allows for the jury to estimate the age of the victim, taking into account the person's appearance, demeanour and other relevant matters as well as whatever evidence is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to some of the particular difficulties with the bill as currently drafted. I emphasise again that these are offered as constructive criticisms. I mention also that they are offered as a selection of comments from those which have been made. They are by no means exclusive; they are intended only to demonstrate the need for a detailed review of the bill which could be conveniently and expeditiously done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A general comment which is appropriate is that some of the language is vague and the possibility of tightening it should be pursued. I referred earlier to the definition of the act of encouragement which is in section 50DB. The definition is very wide in scope. Given the severity of the penalties involved, the drafting needs to be considered most carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns with proposed section 50FA, which allows the jury to estimate the age of the alleged victim. It can be foreseen that there may be difficulty for a jury, likely to be largely of European extraction and living in Australia, to determine the age of an alleged victim, likely to be of Asian extraction and normally living in Asia. This will be made more difficult, as I am sure the minister has foreseen, in cases where the alleged victim will only give evidence to the jury by way of video, thereby probably giving the evidence from Asia, or by means of a photograph. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is potentially unfair where an estimate is being made of the age of a child where the child's age appears to be at the borders of one of the age categories. In the case of an alleged act of sexual intercourse, the determination of whether a child is 15 or 16 will involve the difference between, on the one hand, a conviction and a potential penalty of 14 years and, on the other hand, an acquittal with no penalty. Similarly, in the case of an allegation of sexual intercourse where the question is whether the child is 11 or 12, the difference between conviction of one offence as against another will involve different maximum penalties of 17 years and 14 years respectively. There is scope for injustice under the arrangements proposed in the bill on this particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A technical point raised by Professor Lanham shows that the bill may provide an unnecessary loophole for those who are charged pursuant to the legislation. The point is that there appears to be a gap in the scheme which results from the way the age limits are specified. Sections 50BA and 50BB can be taken as an example. Those provisions provide that it is an offence to engage in sexual intercourse with a person who is under 12 and with a person who is at least 12 but under 16, respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If evidence before a jury were such that it was clear that the child was either 11 or 12 but it could not be determined which, the jury could not reasonably determine beyond reasonable doubt that the child was 11 or was 12. In that event, the jury would properly be forced to acquit the accused of an offence under both sections&mdash;that is, 50BA and 50BB. That clearly is not an intended result. While some juries might take a pragmatic approach and convict the accused on the lesser offence, it would not be doing its job according to the law if it were to do so. The jury would be in a difficult situation, where it would feel morally compelled to act otherwise than in accordance with its duty. Legislation should not present a jury with such dilemma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar issue arises in relation to a number of other provisions in the bill. A solution suggested by Professor Lanham in relation to the example provided may be to make it an offence under clause 50BB to engage in sexual intercourse with a child under 16. A provision could then be inserted that if there is a conviction under section 50BA then there may not be a conviction under section 50BB in respect of the same set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another question arises in relation to defences based on the belief of the alleged offender as to the age and consent of the child. Section 50CA provides that the subjective belief concerning age and consent constitute a defence, and under section 50CB a valid genuine marriage plus a belief in consent are sufficient to provide a defence. Under section 50CD, the jury may take into account whether the belief was reasonable in determining whether the defendant had the subjective belief. It should be noted that the defence is not excluded if the defence is not reasonable. In other words, there is no requirement for the alleged offender to establish that the belief was reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been noted that this may cause problems, particularly in relation to situations where intoxication is an element. Under Australian common law, the fact that the defendant was intoxicated must be taken into account in interpreting this legislation and determining whether the defendant believed the alleged victim was of a certain age or consented. A view has been expressed that the bill should be amended to provide that the belief must be a reasonable one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not inappropriate to suggest that the title of the bill is unnecessarily emotive. The term `child sex tourism' used in the current title is colloquial but, in my submission, it is also inappropriate and even misleading because the subject matter of the bill is not, as the title suggests, limited to exploitation of children by tourists. The view of the coalition is that the bill could be more appropriately titled the Crimes (Overseas Exploitation of Children) Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of enforcement is crucial to the success of the bill. Although the bill sends out an important message to the community, it is important that it have teeth. The successful enforcement will depend upon the establishment of specialist law enforcement units with trained investigators. Exchange of intelligence needs to be undertaken between Australian bodies such as the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs Service and state police forces. Also vital will be the relationships developed between Australian authorities and those in countries where the activities are occurring. That may involve the negotiation of mutual assistance treaties or the application and expansion of existing treaties. Examination of the bill at the committee stage will enable important information concerning the government intention in these regards to be made known. As indicated earlier, examination will also enable the review of the bill's provisions to ensure that they are workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that the coalition strongly supports the objectives of the bill. For its part, the coalition will do whatever is necessary to expedite a detailed review of the bill by the standing committee in order to ensure that its objectives are achieved. It must be an enforceable and effective statute when enacted. The coalition commends the government for its resolute intention to deal with the dreadful practices which have given rise to the bill. I commend to the House the motion proposed to be moved by the minister to suspend standing orders in order that the bill may be referred to the standing committee for review and report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the House and the general Australian community will be gratified by the action of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) in moving expeditiously to deal with a problem which has long vexed many sections of our society. I think they will be heartened by the fact that the opposition has responded to this legislation in keeping with its spirit, and I commend the view that the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, at the minister's initiation, go to a committee of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I do not want to delay the House in its consideration of this bill, and I have only one matter which I believe should be considered. If one goes to those Asian countries where prostitution involving young women and children under age is practised, in almost all cases those young women and children are being exploited or being managed by someone who benefits from that act of exploitation. We are not simply dealing with an individual paedophile operating, as it were, on the chance of meeting a child in the street and proceeding to seduce him or her. We are dealing with what is clearly a well-organised racket which basically operates with children and underage people&mdash;people under 16 years of age&mdash;who have no rights. They are the objects of defilement and exploitation, and they have no choice about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That being the case, under clause 50CF, which relates to when belief for consent must be disregarded, it is not difficult to imagine that those who are unscrupulous enough to exploit children and profit from this industry&mdash;which is what it is, whether they be Australian paedophiles gratifying their perversions or whether they are running those children for profit&mdash;will also, to maintain some level of defence, provide either false certificates saying that children are over 16 years of age or written statements provided by the children themselves saying that they are over 16 years of age. That, on the basis of a payment or a fee, becomes a let-out for the paedophile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the committee when considering this matter will look at the issue in this context. I believe that if there is a monetary inducement&mdash;no matter whether it is paid directly to the child or to someone who is running the child&mdash;or a monetary transaction for the procurement of the child, the belief about consent should be disregarded. Those who are involved in this gross exploitation are people who, in order to pursue their sexual practices, not only are prepared to go overseas to commit what they know would be offences if committed in Australia but also are prepared to go to extraordinary ends to indulge their gratifications. I believe we have to see this as a practice that goes essentially to the fundamental rights of the child. </PARA>

I am certain it will do some good in the broad general community to know that there are issues in this parliament about which members on both sides agree.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill, although I acknowledge the comments made by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), on the need for the bill to be referred to either the House or Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and the need for some amendments to tighten up some of the areas that are either vague or difficult to define within the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the growth of the child prostitution and tourism industry is a matter of serious concern to the Australian community. It has become much more prevalent in recent years and, of course, is becoming more and more the subject of grave concern to the countries themselves that are subject to those visits by predominantly European males or people of European descent to engage in prostitution or sexual acts with juveniles in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, in the first instance, to look at the need for the legislation. Clearly, there are a number of significant reasons for the legislation to be enacted. When one looks overall at the background of the growth in the child prostitution industry, one needs to consider the circumstances under which child prostitution has grown. I suppose the most important of those reasons are the financial rewards and the conditions under which some of these juveniles or children have been forced, induced or persuaded into prostituting themselves to foreign visitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that there is no single cause for child prostitution and, as a consequence, there is no simple solution. There are a variety of reasons for child prostitution, as I have already mentioned, such as terrible poverty, lack of job opportunities and the problems of debt. As a consequence of indebtedness on the part of the children's parents or guardians or the children themselves, they are forced into bondage&mdash;almost a form of child slavery&mdash;prostitution and brothels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that at times parents, guardians or families are forced or tricked into selling their children into sexual slavery. We also know that, in the predominant areas of this activity, tourism is of great importance to the host countries. Because of debt or the desire to earn greater foreign income, tourism tends to take on importance over the welfare of those particular youngsters who are involved in these disgusting forms of activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desire to encourage tourism on the part of the countries that are the principal areas of this activity often leads to officials turning a blind eye to the activities. In some instances they are actually encouraging the trade or being involved in the trade, as some evidence has shown to be the case, particularly in Thailand. Cheap sex and a small likelihood of punishment are not insignificant inducements or incentives for those who are looking for that type of activity to visit those countries and gratify their peculiar sexual desires on the local population, including the local children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to an article in the publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reform</EMPHASIS> written by Justice Elizabeth Evatt and Jenni Millbank. They are not commentators that I would often be sharing views with; nonetheless, in this particular instance they have identified some important factors in this peculiar and disgusting trade. One of these is the power of a western tourist who is visiting one of these countries. The opportunity is presented by the fact that they are adults and the fact that, because of their income, or the amount of money they have brought with them, they are relatively wealthy compared with the people who are the subjects of their gratification. Hence, they have an enormous amount of power&mdash;both economic and physical. So it obviously will be difficult to prevent this type of activity from going on without having the opportunity to punish or provide a great disincentive to those people who seek that type of sexual activity, particularly in Asian countries. There is a systematic form of exploitation in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Thailand and the Philippines, child prostitution involves mostly young girls who are sold into domestic service in the city. The major issues there are abuse in the home, poverty, trickery and fraud on the parents and girls by the procurers who manage to get them into that particular trade. There is an opportunity for that type of inducement or procurement to be reduced by better educational exchange programs to demonstrate to those victims, the hapless villagers and their families who are involved, the tactics that are used by procurers and tricksters. Poverty is hard to overcome, but I think education, training and employment might help to lessen the dependence those children have on their employment in order to provide a source of income for their parents, families or others who may have been tricked, procured or induced into this trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence that, as demand for child prostitution increases, there is a corresponding increase in fraud and outright abductions to get girls away from their villages to the cities and, increasingly, to other countries to meet this demand. There needs to be a quite substantial campaign to reduce the serious inroads that this type of activity has on those areas in the countries that are affected by terrible poverty or that are ignorant to the tactics and trickery used by the procurers in order to induce them to allow their girls to go into brothels in the cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sri Lanka, the other major area of this activity, the situation is somewhat different. The predominant type of child prostitution involves teenage and younger boys. Some of these boys are lured into brothels by adult pimps. Many of them act in gangs or alone and solicit part time to supplement their income. When faced with the problem of child sexual exploitation, the natural response by most is that there ought to be a law against this and something ought to be done. Many of the countries with child prostitution have laws making prostitution or procuring or exploiting child prostitution illegal. Some countries have introduced laws specifically directed against foreign tourists who sexually exploit children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is in enforcing these laws in the country, particularly where the perpetrators are foreigners who are wealthy by local standards. By local standards those tourists, who are wealthy by comparison, and those procurers, who are often very wealthy, often are able to bribe their way out of trouble. An additional difficulty is presented by the fact that the children may be breaking the law in their own country, even though they are being exploited by someone else. Therefore, there is a natural fear of being prosecuted oneself. That makes it more difficult for the country to successfully prosecute relatively wealthy tourists who are availing themselves of that particular type of activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, against that background we have the legislation that has been described here by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), the shadow minister and others. It is a very necessary piece of legislation that attempts to provide circumstances within Australia which create the disincentive necessary to try to get at the source of the problem. One of the sources of the problem is the people who are looking to participate in these offences: the tourists themselves&mdash;the paedophiles who are going overseas, either individually or in groups, and participating in some of this behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been concerned for some time about the problems associated with paedophile networks in this country. It is quite clear that, in relation to the visits overseas by paedophiles who are availing themselves of child prostitutes and paedophile activities, the network of information that appears to be available to them within the country is a matter of some concern. There has been some quite prevalent comment about paedophile networks in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the recent report of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, there were references to paedophile networks and some recommendations arose from them. In particular, in reference to organised paedophile networks, paragraph 472 of the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past few years information has emerged about the existence of networks of paedophiles operating in this country. Inquiries conducted by a number of police services have given rise to allegations that these networks are involved in the production and distribution of child pornography, share in successful seduction strategies and personal details of potential victims, organise child sex tours of Third World countries and possibly sponsor the migration of children from overseas. There has also been evidence of these networks receiving protection by corrupt police.</PARA>
<PARA>The matter of concern is contained in paragraph 4.73, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paedophile networks have not been the subject of proactive law enforcement primarily because of a lack of resources. As a consequence, the extent of the networks and their activities remain unknown. Nevertheless, the illegal activities of groups such as these have the capacity to generate profits and there is evidence that they are organised.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the finding of the report of the review of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies, one has to be critical of the Commonwealth government in taking so long to come, in part-way, to trying to deal with what is a very serious social problem. The fact that there is little known about paedophile networks within Australia is a matter of some significant concern. The fact that resources have not been properly allocated in order to combat the perfidious influence of paedophile networks and their activities in promoting information and in encouraging people to participate in child sex tours is a matter of even more note. If one were to be critical of the Australian government, that would have to be one of the points worth criticising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Denis Lenihan, the former chief executive officer of the National Crime Authority, wrote what I consider to be a very constructive and helpful article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. He was concerned about the recommendation that the NCA's functions and activities be fused with those of the Australian Federal Police. He mentioned in particular that if the recommendations were accepted the NCA would no longer have its own telephone interception surveillance information technology and corporate support facilities. That is also a matter of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Combating the activities of organised paedophile networks quite obviously necessitates the availability on a national basis of extensive facilities and resources. Clearly, with the sort of technology that is available at the moment&mdash;bulletin boards and information exchange technology&mdash;this problem requires a national strategy, but that is something which many of the state forces that are trying to deal with child abuse and other activities of paedophiles find beyond their means. That is where the Commonwealth government has a very important role to play. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time remaining to me I will deal with some of the problems that arise from the legislation. If one were talking about the importance of the offences, this would probably seem a little bit inconsistent. However, as a person who has always respected the importance of the onus of proof resting on the prosecution&mdash;in other words, the basic principle that a person is considered to be innocent until proven guilty&mdash;I find it a bit difficult to understand the requirement that there has to be a defence. Let us say that there is a requirement for a person to prove, even on the lesser standard of the balance of probabilities in the defence to a prosecution for an offence against division 2 of the bill that, at the time of the act, there existed between the defendant and the person in relation to whom the offence was allegedly committed a marriage that was valid, or recognised as valid, under the law of the place where the marriage was solemnised, the place where the offence was allegedly committed or the place of the defendant's residence or domicile. That issue would be of some concern to anybody who is concerned about the preservation of that important legal principle that, in criminal offences, a person is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. I would not like to see that standard, that onus of proof, reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 5 of the bill relates to the video link-up that is proposed in order to facilitate the taking of evidence in cases involving the child victim, the other party, who would become a witness in their own country. The minister says in the explanatory memorandum to the bill that minimum outlays would be required in order to be able to pay for the running of this particular legislation, and that could come from the AFP's budget and the DPP's budget. The provision of a high standard of communication between the country where the offence took place&mdash;where the witness is&mdash;and Australia is going to require an enormous amount of expenditure. The other problem is the maintenance of the standard of quality of evidence and the opportunities for the defendant to be able to properly cross-examine the person who is making the allegations against him or her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) has already mentioned the problem relating to the estimation of age. I have some concern with that matter because the age estimation is a matter that is material to the offence and the subsequent punishment in the event of a person being convicted. If a person is near the borderline of 12 years old, where the difference between the two levels of punishment is a matter of two years imprisonment, there is the opportunity for a jury to be overly influenced by the emotion of a case. Let us face it, most of these cases are enormously emotional; nobody is unmoved by stories of the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of children. I think any reasonable citizen is going to be moved emotionally by that. Under circumstances where there is no evidence of age available in the evidence-in-chief it would be difficult for a jury to make a decision in a rational way, perhaps uninfluenced by the emotions of the case. I would caution the minister to look at that aspect of the legislation. If the Senate does refer this legislation to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for review, that is one area I would like to see looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further area of concern is the double jeopardy aspect of the legislation. One of the fundamental principles of criminal law in Australia is that a person is not able to be punished twice for the same offence. The difficulty with clause 50FD of the bill is that a person cannot be charged or convicted in an Australian court if they have already been dealt with in the courts of the country in which they have committed the offence. That is a problem. It may well be a loophole through which some crafty offenders may try to get out of being properly prosecuted in their own country. If we are looking at the sources of the requirement for that sort of legislation, one is the fact that it is difficult to sustain prosecutions in the host country&mdash;the country where the offences have taken place. In relation to double jeopardy, a person who is wanting to avoid perhaps the higher standard of prosecution, a more serious punishment, and the lesser opportunity for influencing the witness, may well choose to try to get themselves prosecuted in another country and be able to influence the outcome of that prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the legislation to the House. I also commend the comments made by the honourable member for Tangney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first opportunity I have had since the local government elections held in Queensland on 26 March 1994 to set the record straight on the characters of six dedicated councillors from the Burnett region. This place has been used prior to by-elections and the Brisbane City Council election and in relation to the performance of the Victorian government to pursue political agendas. I will not step into that mire. But fair play demands that justice be done to the six in question. I refer to councillors Kevin Hockey, Peter Webster, Doug McIver and Bill Roberts and former councillors Alec McIntosh and Walter White. Early in 1990 these men made appeals, as one might expect of people holding such office in local government, for increased road funding. Their appeals were sincere in intent and quite reasonable, even benign, in intensity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For their temerity, they were accused by my predecessor in Hinkler, through their alleged complicity, of being agents of what he described as the `corrupt and discredited National Party government'&mdash;as honourable members of that era will remember, one of his constant themes. Florid language was used, including such terms as `fool', `liar', `rip off', `detriment to ratepayers', `skilful manipulation', et cetera. Their supposed membership of the National Party was the basis of their alleged lying and neglect. This, in turn, came from their accuser's interpretation of their stance on the Self inquiry into local government financing. Of course, even if we accept this convoluted interpretation, it was no justification for so vile an attack&mdash;and certainly not for one which enjoyed the privilege of this House. I will not reflect further on my predecessor, but it is appropriate that this injustice be righted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These men, as of election day, had the extraordinary collective record of 150 years in local government service and 99 years of shire chairmanship. It is an incredible record, probably unequalled in any other subregion of Australia. They were not old fogies but practitioners with voracious appetites for hard work in and dedication to their communities. On the retirement of Councillor McIntosh on 26 March, he concluded 24 years as shire chairman and 33 as a councillor, to say nothing of his service to the South Burnett Hospitals Board, the electricity board, the ambulance committee and six years as State Vice-President of the Queensland Local Government Association.

The attack on their characters was interpreted by many as a smear. It was hurtful and aimed at denigrating them in their communities. To their credit, they rose above it, and the attack earned the ire of their towns and the local government association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to my opening theme, these men needed no veiled promotion by me in this House prior to the local government elections. Indeed, the four continuing in local government were returned as shire chairmen&mdash;or mayors as they are now called in Queensland&mdash;unopposed. I stress to you, Mr Speaker, and to honourable members that all four were unopposed. This, the fact of being elected unopposed, is the acid test and a measure of the respect in which they are held in their communities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a subject which I know is near and dear to you, Mr Speaker. Since I have been in this House, I have had to attend a vast number of meetings about public hospitals in New South Wales. In fact, I have attended meetings at Kiama, Berri, Nowra, Ulladulla, Wollongong and Port Kembla. Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, these meetings are about the total inadequacy of public funding to hospitals in our area. There is one crime all these hospitals have in common: they lie within Labor or Independent held seats. It is outrageous that in a previous sitting of this parliament people on the other side determined that funds which were allocated for sporting grants were wrong on the basis of a supposed and alleged&mdash;which is totally wrong&mdash;favouritism to the Labor Party. In this instance, the only two hospitals in my whole region that have gained any money are in the seats of Russell Smith and the Premier of New South Wales, John Fahey. Kiama hospital was closed, despite Mr Greiner, prior to becoming Premier, categorically denying that after the election he would close it down. He cannot be trusted. Thirteen beds were transferred to Shellharbour and six of those beds are left. The children's wards in Shellharbour hospital have been closed down. There is no children's ward in Milton-Ulladulla hospital. At the Port Kembla hospital, which services one of the greatest industrial areas of New South Wales, it is being discussed that the casualty unit be taken out. I suggest this is an absolutely outrageous dereliction of duty by the state government. It has absolutely no regard, no respect, for the health wishes and needs of its people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a large number of elderly people. I would like to relate some personal experience I have had. I had close family ties with the Kiama hospital prior to its closure in that two people who were near and dear to me, two of my grandparents, died there. One was Mr W.E. Knott, my grandfather on my father's side, and the other was Ethel Griffin, my grandmother on my mother's side. Both of those people died in that hospital with some dignity. I particularly related to my grandmother because she lived with us for so long. She was a part of the community. She was in the position of having her mates and family able to come and visit her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that much of the health and recovery from illness of our elderly population hinges on access to their family, mates and partners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The absolute and total disregard for the needs of the people of New South Wales, the absolute sham in the allocation of resources and the vote catching and pork-barrelling of Premier Fahey in putting money into his own electorate and into Smith's electorate in Bega and then bleeding all the other hospitals dry is an absolute scandal of outrageous proportions. I asked for three things&mdash;three things I will continue to stand for&mdash;when I spoke to over 600 people in Ulladulla. First, a 24-hour service by doctors&mdash;they will not give that service in our neck of the woods&mdash;secondly, bulkbilling and access to bulkbilling; and, thirdly, adequate funding for public hospitals. </PARA>

Mr Fahey has no regard and no respect for them, and I suggest that he should give the game up and leave running this country to people who will do the right thing by the elderly of this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to a question in the Senate on 1 March 1994 about the ABC's involvement in pay television, Senator McMullan, representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), stated that the ABC's pay TV would be:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . fully commercial and involve no risk to the Commonwealth, that there be no further budget subvention to cover operating costs, and that there be no detriment to ABC free to air services.</PARA>
<PARA>This raises some serious questions regarding the prospects for the survival of the ABC in its current form. The initial ABC pay TV service is planned to comprise a news and current affairs channel, and a second channel for fine drama and children's programs. Where will the money to start these channels come from? Will the ABC float further loans beyond the approximately $200 million it has already? Are fine drama and children's programs to be now only available to those who can pay for it? Is the H.R. Nicholls Society alive and well and living in the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition from the ABC's pay TV drama channel will certainly siphon programs and program resources currently available within the ABC away from free to air TV. Viewers will be resistant to paying for ABC TV drama unless its programs are either commercial or of high quality. In any case the incentive will be to provide cheap drama for free to air TV to attract viewers and advertisers. Under this new regime, pay TV ratings will be revenue useful, and free to air ratings revenue useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC will be placed in the position of having to devote current resources away from free to air programming to pay TV programming to bolster its future pay TV ratings and future revenue stream. Conversely, having good quality programs on free to air will erode the advertising and sponsorship rates for pay TV. As ratings must be the yardstick, ABC pay TV will be allocated more resources to produce programs that tend in style and content towards the commercial networks' programs, while ABC free to air has fewer resources with which it is expected to be more innovative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pay TV will inevitably eat up resources to create a high-rating product that is indistinguishable from commercial products. This will be opposed not only by traditional ABC viewers but also by commercial television interests for using government funding to trample into commercial programming territory, threatening their ratings and advertising revenue. The commercial networks will soon understand that they face the prospect of their revenue falling as numbers of both their viewers and advertisers reduce. The viewers will come to realise that the proposal threatens the quality and variety of TV programming and their access to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alarmingly for the ABC's editorial independence, the proposal presents serious dangers. It has been mooted that ABC pay TV will be set up under a separate corporation from that for free to air services. However, with a common board and managing director it will be practically both possible and desirable for sponsors of pay TV programs to influence free to air programming and they will certainly try. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the real world there will be all sorts of spill-over effects. A separate subsidiary company as is proposed is pure newspeak. If pay TV is to be a success in its own right and if it is to be self-funding as a fully fledged commercial operation, it would be much more preferable to establish pay TV under a completely separate company with a separate chairman, board and managing director. But if this were the case what would be the point in any ABC involvement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC was set up as a public broadcaster, run with aims that are intentionally distinct from those of commercial broadcasting. There is no way the quality and variety in Australian TV broadcasting could be improved by threatening the ABC's free to air TV, its budget allocation and its programming freedom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the evidence of the last few years there has been an inexorable ratcheting of the ABC towards commercialisation and a white-anting of its charter. Senator McMullan's Senate comments are superficial and inspire no confidence. No case has been established in the public interest for the public broadcaster to involve itself in pay TV. Indeed, it goes right against the fundamental purpose for which the ABC was originally founded. It is an extreme form of economic rationalism to deprive the less well off of fine drama and news and children's programs because they cannot pay. </PARA>

<TITLE>Federal Airports Corporation</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="90" SPEAKER="Latham Mr M." NAMEID="K26" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="K26">Mr LATHAM</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Werriwa)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the government's decision to examine the privatisation of some of the assets of the Federal Airports Corporation within the framework of national and regional competition policies. As we know, market competition between Australia's infrastructure providers is required to sustain higher productivity, lower costs and benefits for consumers. Market competition makes transparent the conflict between the short-term sectional interests of producers and the long-term public interests of consumers. This trade-off in public policy is integral to the challenges facing this government in public enterprise reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitiveness of the Australian economy relies substantially on the acceleration and extension of competition policies across the public sector, and the government is strongly supporting the recommendations of the Hilmer report. Without competition, ownership issues are hardly relevant. Corporatised public monopolies are unable to compare their rates of investment return with private sector equivalents. It is difficult, for instance, to judge whether the FAC's performance is competitive or uncompetitive. The recent evidence, however, is not encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prices Surveillance Authority has been highly critical of the FAC's pricing policies and investment criteria. Large capital outlays on aeronautical projects such as terminal expansions are driven more by engineering and service standards than by full economic evaluation. In most cases, private monopolies are no more productive than public monopolies. This of course makes absurd the FAC's suggestion on the basis of its Standard and Poor's credit rating that full privatisation to a single buyer is preferable to breaking its assets into competing airports, some of which could then be offered for sale. If the trading performance of an airport in Australia cannot attract credit arrangements, then it should not receive capital funding other than by transparent and accountable government subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC has publicised concerns about the viability of its 13 smaller unprofitable airports under a regime of partial privatisation. It would be much better advised to act on the recommendations of the 1993 PSA report. The FAC uses the same pricing structure at each of its 23 airports, irrespective of local demand and cost factors. Investment and trading strategies hinge on floored cross-subsidisation practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of transparency for subsidies between airports and between aeronautical and non-aeronautical activities makes the financial performance of each airport difficult to examine. The grouping of cost and revenue information for seven airports&mdash;Hobart, Cambridge, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Bankstown, Camden and Hoxton Park&mdash;makes an external evaluation of their performance impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By breaking up the FAC and its monopoly practices, the government can achieve a more rational allocation of airport resources in Australia. Full cost pricing can turn around the financial position of smaller airports and enhance their attractiveness for privatisation, or at least establish a proper basis for community service obligations. So privatisation should be seen not as an end in itself, which is the policy of the opposition, but as the best means for establishing airport competition in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though the potential for direct competition is limited to major centres such as Sydney, Melbourne and south-east Queensland, private ownership can broaden the concept of market competition around airports. In competitive nations such as the United States, parts of Europe and East Asia, airports are seen as not just for the arrival and departure of planes; they are used in regional and economic strategies as catalysts for industry clustering, economic land development and tourism marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Private enterprise has a vested interest in turning airports into economic success stories. In Australia the FAC, with its monopoly charter, undertakes no such dynamic planning. We only have to read the recommendations of the recent McKinsey study to show that private sector development of airports, or at least non-FAC development such as the Cairns airport, is an important catalyst for regional strategies. The absence of airport competition in Sydney, Melbourne and south-east Queensland will continue to restrict the quality of aviation services and economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of an international airport at Badgerys Creek in Sydney's west, for instance, has been prejudicial to the FAC's monopoly and commercial charter. Tomorrow's white paper should correct that prejudice, and should lead to the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in Sydney's west and south-west&mdash;the largest regional economic development project in Australia this decade&mdash;through the development of the international airport, the development of the transport links and substantial land development around the airport site for manufacturing and tourism purposes. We should support this, along with the competition agenda of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to expose scandalous actions by the state Labor government in Queensland which could destroy the booming tourism industry in the Glasshouse Mountains area of my electorate. Honourable members would be aware that the Sunshine Coast hinterland is where these beautiful landmarks are situated, and that they were so named by Captain James Cook in 1770 because, from the sea, they reminded him of glasshouses. They are blessed with rich soil, and are the centre of a highly productive horticultural industry. In fact, various tropical fruits, including pineapples, bananas, pawpaws, custard apples, strawberries, passionfruit, kiwi fruit and citrus fruits, as well as macadamias, are grown there. In addition, dairying, poultry, vegetables and tobacco are other industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, the Glasshouse Mountains area is a mecca for visitors, in many cases day trippers from the Sunshine Coast and Brisbane, and also those who want to stay longer, including many eco-tourists. They are attracted by the scenic beauty of the area, available adventure and sporting pursuits, and many wish to enjoy the warm hospitality of residents. Increasingly popular are rock and mountain climbing and abseiling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally all of this would present the area with a prosperous future and many employment opportunities. However, the state Labor government has banned commercial tourist operators from the national parks which cover most of the area. This means that mountain and rock climbing, abseiling, camping and, in many cases, even photography in the Glasshouse Mountains are now banned because some Aboriginal groups have approached the state government. Among these is a group which has made a Mabo-style claim over most of Caloundra, the Pumicestone Passage, the Glasshouse Mountains and Bribie Island. In my experience there are very few, if any, resident Aborigines in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also seen reports that the National Parks and Wildlife Service officers have withdrawn brochures promoting the Glasshouse Mountains area from national parks offices. I understand the reason this is happening is that they want to reduce recreational and tourist activity in the area. To me this situation is absolutely unbelievable. Today I set out to check the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After many unsuccessful attempts to contact Bruce Gall, the director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service&mdash;I suspect he was dodging me&mdash;I finally spoke to Mr Daniel McGreevy, senior ministerial policy adviser to Molly Robson, the minister. He told me that a management plan was under consideration, that a draft plan would be released and that public comment would be invited. He also said that he was not aware that the policy of banning commercial tourist operators was in fact in force. That might reassure some people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later I spoke to Des Boylan, the south-eastern regional director of the Department of the Environment and Heritage. He confessed to me that, although there was no management plan in force and although no draft management plan had been prepared for public comment, for the past 18 months commercial operators had been banned because of discussions with local Aborigines. I put to him that this action by his department pre-empted any management plan. He said, `Well, that could be your view.' In my view, what the department is doing makes an absolute sham of the consultation process. No announcement was made of the change of policy. Indeed, the government has changed the policy in this area by stealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received very many complaints from local Glasshouse Mountains residents and from local business people, and I agree totally with them. The Glasshouse Mountains belong to all coast residents and other Australians. To discriminate against them on racial grounds is unjust. Why on earth should the state Labor government risk killing off eco-tourism, local tourism, tourism which has the capacity to take the area out of recession and to create jobs? It is absolute madness. The Glasshouse Mountains growing tourism industry could be devastated. Jobs will be lost and the local economy hard hit if the government does not reverse its crazy policy forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a great deal of pleasure and a certain degree of humility that I rise this evening to speak about a remarkable woman. In March this year I was lucky enough to attend a dinner held in order to pay tribute to Sister Olive Smith of the Blue Nursing Service in Ipswich in my electorate on the occasion of her retirement. It was a terrific honour to be able to salute such a great pioneer of health care in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sister Olive Smith has the distinction of being the original Blue Nurse. When she was known as Sister Crombie, she started the Blue Nursing Domiciliary Service in Brisbane in August 1953 as a full-time sister. At that time there was no guarantee of wages beyond the first three weeks; nor was there any government support. However, the community responded to the need expressed in this pioneering venture and the service expanded rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From that humble beginning, the Blue Nursing Service has grown into the diverse service it is today, consisting of some 510 full-time equivalent registered nurses from 63 centres state-wide who will travel some eight million kilometres to care for 25,000 patients in their own homes. In addition, the service has 39 nursing homes, 50 hostels for the aged, 47 respite centres for aged or disabled persons, 1,200 retirement units and nine day therapy centres across Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ipswich Blue Nursing Service in my electorate commenced operations in 1954. Sister Smith joined the Ipswich service in 1978, becoming director of nursing in May 1981. In a period spanning more than a decade, Sister Smith has provided stewardship to a service which is now the second largest in Queensland and which has earned the widespread support of the Ipswich community. Through her unswerving devotion to the cause of nursing and unassuming, gracious manner, she has endeared herself to the hundreds of clients served by a loyal and devoted staff. I am pleased to be able to say that the government recognises the importance of the work begun by Sister Olive Smith and carried on by the Blue Nurses today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Friday I had the great pleasure of informing the Blue Nursing Service in Ipswich of an increase in its funding grants under the home and community care, or HACC, program. The Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) recently approved an increase of $13,751 for the Blue Nursing Service Ipswich Respite Care Centre, bringing total HACC funding for this facility to $135,347. In addition to this, the nursing service will receive $1,120,975 in HACC funding to enable it to expand its vital work, allowing for an extra 20 hours per week of in-home respite care provided by visiting Blue Nurses. I applaud the minister for her actions in approving the grants for the Ipswich Blue Nurses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sister Olive Smith has provided expertise to the Ipswich service as well as making a significant contribution to many community and government organisations operating in related areas. On a personal level, Sister Smith has given special dedicated support to a son with a disability and to the organisation Crossroads, a group established to support people with disabilities. Her dedication, loyalty and spirit of service to Blue Nursing Service patients and staff led to her nomination in 1987 by the Rotary Club of Ipswich North for the pride of workmanship award. In 1993, Sister Smith was given further recognition in the Queen's Birthday honours when she received the Medal of the Order of Australia for service both to people with disabilities and to nursing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sister Smith's spirit of service and high calibre of contribution to society over such an extensive period has a dual significance of outstanding merit in its own right and as a symbol of the commencement of the Blue Nursing Service throughout Queensland. Sister Smith's retirement marks an historical moment in the delivery of health and caring services in the community in Queensland. It is a great honour for me to be able to be here to inform the House of the remarkable achievement of Sister Olive Smith. I wish her and her husband a long and happy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a happy note. In recent years the Western Australian police force, of which I was formerly a member, has received a fair amount of criticism. It is a general feature of discussion about law and order and law enforcement that police forces have received a fair number of brickbats. So it is a pleasure to be able to rise to offer some praise for the efforts of Western Australian police force officers. In particular, I want to mention Detective Sergeant Peter Coombs, a former colleague of mine, who went through the Western Australian police academy with me in 1979. He was part of a team that broke the back of an Italian organised crime network with the conviction on Monday of Bruno `The Fox' Romeo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Romeo was named in a 1965 crime intelligence report as a South Australian leader of L'Onorata Societa, the Calabrian equivalent to the Sicilian mafia. Despite the report's findings, Mr Romeo has managed to elude authorities for almost 30 years, until a Western Australian detective took up the hunt and refused to let go. I am indebted also to the reports by Robyn Cash and Tamara Hunter from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian </EMPHASIS>newspaper. Robyn Cash has been a long time hound&mdash;to use a term&mdash;on the trail of the organised criminal elements within Western Australia and elsewhere. In fact, at one stage, she was involved in newspaper reporting in Griffith in New South Wales. I suppose if a person wanted to uncover organised criminal activity, particularly the drug trade, Griffith is not one of the best places to do that. It probably provides plenty of material but, at the same time, it is probably dangerous&mdash;as Donald Mackay found out all those years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Detective Sergeant Coombs, who was seconded to the National Crime Authority, was in the District Court to see his quarry plead guilty to cultivating cannabis and conspiracy charges. Mr Romeo will almost certainly spend his twilight years behind bars which, in the interests of the Australian community as well as the Western Australian community, is a good thing. The Crown Prosecutor, Mr Stone, told Judge Hal Jackson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a case of sophisticated, organised crime extending over four years and on a very large scale.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that Romeo, an Adelaide businessman, had been a hands-on operator within the well-organised, Australia-wide crime syndicate which had plotted the cultivation of cannabis on two Western Australian sheep stations for sale on the eastern seaboard. He had financed the syndicate's operations, including the purchase by front men of two remote properties, Kalli station near Cue and Mount Elvire station near Southern Cross, on which three cannabis crops worth $8 million were grown and another worth much more was planned. Mr Romeo has been remanded in custody for sentencing on 31 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was the first man arrested in Operation Cerberus, which has been a national drive by the National Crime Authority against Italian-influenced organised crime in Australia. That reference was given to the National Crime Authority on June 1992 as the details of Mr Romeo's activities were unfolding in a marathon drug trial in the Perth District Court. Ten men, allegedly co-conspirators of Romeo, are on trial for growing a string of cannabis crops on outback sheep and cattle stations in Western Australia. Mr Romeo was named as the ringleader, but the jury heard that he had escaped arrest despite a national and international man-hunt. At the time, trial judge Robert Keall said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ABC has advised that discussions on a continuing basis have occurred with a wide range of parties interested in the delivery of subscription television broadcast services in Australia. Those discussions have included substantial media companies based in Europe, the United States, Asia and Australia and encompass such groups as the consortium generally known as PMT.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) and (6) An important consideration for the Government in reaching a decision on ABC participation in Pay TV was that any such participation should not adversely affect the ABC's achievement of its Charter responsibilities or impinge on the independence of the ABC. Accordingly, the terms of the Government's decision included that Pay TV activities be undertaken by the ABC on a fully commercial basis, and that there should be no detriment to the free-to-air services. These requirements have been reinforced through the legislative condition that the ABC establish a separate corporate structure to operate and manage its Pay TV activities.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) Regional Offices and Teleservice Centres were advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) Those clients affected were about two in ten of Newstart and Job Search Allowance recipients. Half of these could not lodge their fortnightly renewal form until the following day so their payment was delayed by one day. Funds for the other half of clients were in their bank accounts and accessible through Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs). Some of those clients would have faced a one day delay due to the closure of the banks. JSA/NSA clients are the group most often affected by such closures because their `staggered' paydays fall on each working day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) Verbal advice was provided by Regional Offices and Teleservice Centres; this would usually have been in response  to enquiries.</PARA>

At Area or Regional discretion, some signs may have been displayed notifying the specific impact on affected clients. Most of the clients involved are required to personally lodge renewal forms each fortnight and would have been in a position to see such posters. While inserts have been included in the normal fortnightly mailing of renewal forms to this group at particular holiday times in the past, mailing of advices to other clients is generally not done because of the high cost of a special mailing and the confusion it is known to cause for some of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii) Some local coverage may have resulted from Area/Regional media liaison.

The Department is reviewing the Processing Guidelines and, as part of the review, is paying special attention to possible measures to improve the notice to clients affected by national or local holidays, especially by standardising the inclusion of inserts for fortnightly mailings.

It builds on the work that the CDP completed during the period 1988/89&mdash;1992/93 in building a national casemix infrastructure. Three priority areas have been identified for on-going work: classification, costing&mdash;pricing, and payments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) In the case of the recent correspondence to which you refer, letters were sent to selected pensioners which invited them to test their pension entitlement in their country of birth. These letters did contain the wording indicated. I did not approve the wording of the letter. I have since approved a change to the reminder notices that are to be issued to about 20,000 pensioners who did not reply to the initial correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I have been made aware that some elderly citizens are concerned by the number of inquiries they receive. I recently arranged a consultative meeting between officers of my Department and the Australian Council on the Ageing (ACOTA) and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation (APSF) about the way in which my Department communicates with the aged. Several issues raised by ACOTA and APSF relating to the language, style and tone of correspondence sent to age pensioners are currently being examined by my Department and I expect that there will be further improvements. Recently, the Department trialled advising pensioners of the CPI increases through Age Pension News rather than individualised letters. Our initial assessment of reaction to this change is that most pensioners see this as a positive step.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I am aware that there is scope to improve the quality of letters sent to my Department's clients and also to reduce the volume of letters which are sent out. The Department has initiated a "review of client advices" which is examining all types of outward correspondence. In addition, I am aware that with elderly pensioners in particular, it is important to be as clear as possible in correspondence, so as not to cause concern.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The forecast of 5 per cent growth in real gross domestic product for the 1994 calendar year was made by Westpac Bank and is not the official Government forecast.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, the Australian economy is currently growing at a rate sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate. In the recovery, short term unemployed people are likely to find it easier to gain employment than long term unemployed people. The long term unemployed face greater difficulty finding employment for a number of reasons. They suffer a loss of skills and, in some cases, a loss of motivation. They may also be less attractive to employers as a result of their length of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, long term unemployed people need assistance to compete on an equal footing with those who have been unemployed for shorter periods. A Job Compact, as proposed by the Committee on Employment Opportunities, would enhance the prospects of individuals by: (a) increas-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ing the attractiveness to potential employers and reducing the `stigma' of being long term unemployed; (b) restoring skill levels; and (c) improving self-esteem and job-search motivation. Improving the attachment of the long term unemployed to the labour force would not only benefit the individuals concerned but also produce flow-on benefits to the economy and the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee on Employment Opportunities projected the unemployment rate under a 4 3/4 per cent economic growth scenario. Under this scenario, the unemployment rate was projected to be around 5 per cent in 2000-01. The number of long term unemployed could be expected to decline substantially if economic growth at around 5 per cent per annum was to be maintained. This decline would be greatly accelerated by the impact of the Job Compact.</PARA>
