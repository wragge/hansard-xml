<PARA>This bill was introduced into the Senate last year by my colleague Senator Ian Macdonald and it was passed by the Senate on 28 October. This bill was designed to correct an anomaly in the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. It seems remarkable that nearly two years later the government still has not corrected this anomaly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H4">Mr HAWKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I say, it seems remarkable that nearly two years after the government introduced this legislation it still has not corrected this anomaly. It seems remarkable that no credit is being given to the opposition for drawing this to the government's attention and it seems remarkable that, given the government's response to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which acknowledged the problem, there still has been no action. One would hope that the reason for this delay is not that the government wants to discourage people offering to give voluntary or semi-voluntary service through becoming involved in their local councils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of this bill is quite simple. It is, as I say, designed to correct an anomaly in the Superannuation Guarantee Act 1992. That act requires that the superannuation levy be paid for elected councillors and aldermen who receive allowances. This results in councillors and aldermen then not complying with the definition of an eligible person in section 82AA(2) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. That means that they cannot claim a tax deduction for any personal contribution they may make to their own superannuation fund. Only eligible persons can claim deductions for private superannuation and, under the definition, persons are not eligible if 10 per cent or more of their income comes from a source which provides that they have employer funded superannuation support. This means that councillors and aldermen cannot claim in their income tax returns a deduction of up to $3,000 plus 75 per cent of any amount above that for their own personal superannuation contributions if they have qualified for the council superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give the House an example, a councillor who receives a council allowance of $6,000 a year and who is self-employed with an assessable income of $50,000 a year would not be entitled to claim any private superannuation contributions as a tax deduction because the council would be paying the princely sum of $300 a year in compulsory superannuation. In other words, that person is heavily penalised. Even though the majority of that person's income is from his or her own sources, because that person happens to receive from the council an allowance which attracted a $300 superannuation contribution, the major contributions that that person makes for his or her own superannuation would no longer be tax deductible. It means that the government is, in effect, penalising those who seek to serve the community as local government representatives, for which they generally gain very little remuneration. Of course, councils lose out because they have to pay the additional compulsory superannuation contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the former minister for local government the honourable member for Calare  (Mr Simmons) claimed that, as far as local government is concerned, the new superannuation contributions will apply only to Brisbane city councillors who are in receipt of salaries. That obviously was the government's intention, but unfortunately the effect has gone much wider. In reality there are many councillors who are not full time in their job as a councillor, whose main source of income comes from their own business activities, and who have lost the ability to deduct private superannuation contributions from their income tax. In other words, they are being disadvantaged because of their community service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill sets out to remove the anomaly where local government councillors receive only limited allowances in exercising their duties from the superannuation guarantee legislation. It is interesting to note that the bill has the total support of the Municipal Association of Victoria and the Local Government Association of Queensland. Clearly, councillors and aldermen whose substantive form of employment or work is not with a council of which they are members and whose payment reflects this reality cannot, in all seriousness, be considered as employees of that council. Yet section 221A(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act specifically excludes payments by way of remuneration or allowances to a member of a local governing body from the meaning of salary or wages under the PAYE tax system. In other words, the Income Tax Assessment Act does not treat allowances or remuneration for councillors as salaries or wages, but the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act does. The basis of this amendment is to remove that anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the government knows that there is a problem and it has acknowledged that there is a problem. In fact, in July 1992, some 19 months ago, the former minister for local government the honourable member for Calare wrote to all local councils and, in part, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As far as Local Government elected members are concerned the new superannuation arrangements will only apply to councillors who are in receipt of salaries.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the legislation did not reflect this, it was not clear enough and allowances have now been considered as salaries for the purposes of this superannuation act. The government did try to overcome the problem by changing the word `payments' to `remuneration' in the definition of `salaries and wages' in the act. But that did not work because the Australian Taxation Office deemed that local government councillors are in the employ of the council and allowances paid to councillors are salaries or wages for the purposes of this superannuation act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not good enough and this is why we are bringing forward this amendment. The government promised to do something about the problem when it gained support from the Australian Democrats in getting the original superannuation legislation through in 1992. It still has not done anything about this problem. In fact, when the bill passed through the Senate late last year, Senator Ray said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the general attitude of the government is that it would rather have those matters covered in superannuation legislation that we produce.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government was not happy that the opposition should put forward a simple amendment to change the legislation to remove this anomaly. The government wants to bring in its own legislation. The problem is that we are still waiting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Indi points out, there is a touch of arrogance there and it is to be regretted. Nearly two years later, the government still has not produced its own legislation. The government does have a clear responsibility here, one which it has acknowledged but has still managed to renege on. It is a great disappointment to those who are involved in local government to see that the government has been so tardy at best in attacking this problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the government has acknowledged that a problem exists, given that the government does not have any legislation of its own and given the strong support from organisations such as the MAV and the Local Government Association of Queensland, I would have thought the very least that the government could do is support this motion that has been put forward by the opposition. Clearly it addresses the problems and answers the concerns, and I think it deserves bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the bill has already been passed in the Senate and since it clearly has the basic support of the government, I now challenge the government to show that it is big enough to put this to a vote in this House. This would recognise the very constructive role the opposition is playing in this matter, it would recognise the importance of private members business and, most importantly, it would quickly correct an anomaly that is most unfair to local government through a technical fault in a bill that the government introduced in 1992. So I would urge all honourable members to support this motion, and I challenge the government to put it to a vote so as to correct this anomaly once and for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a general sympathy with the motion put forward by the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). On the face of it, it would appear that we do have an anomaly with the existing superannuation guarantee legislation as it applies to people in receipt of allowances in their roles as local government councillors and that the consequence of this anomaly is that people in that situation are at risk of losing their superannuation tax concession should they happen to be self-employed and contributing to their own superannuation as private individuals in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should indicate to the honourable member for Wannon, and it is obviously a matter of opinion as to the timing of these issues, that the government is in fact about to address the issue. It has been in the process of going through a detailed examination of the situation very recently, and I am hopeful that the matter will be addressed in the immediate future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth pointing out that in this legislation there are some complexities involved which the honourable member did not mention. The way that allowances are paid and structured tends to vary across different areas of local government. For example, there are some complexities with the way certain allowances relating to travel and the like are dealt with. It is not necessarily quite as simple as the honourable member presented in his contribution this afternoon. But I would generally accept that the point that is made and contained within the legislation put forward by the Senate is in fact correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to ventilate a couple of broader issues that I think this matter gives rise to and that are worthy of comment and consideration. The first point that comes to mind, and I think it is one honourable members may well want to contemplate, is that one of the reasons this has become a particular problem in local government is that a disproportionate number of people who are self-employed are involved in local government. In itself that is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it illustrates that a problem does exist with local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly in my state, Victoria, and I suspect elsewhere in Australia, a very substantial proportion of the community is effectively prevented from becoming local councillors and from participating in local government because of the nature of their employment. We would all know, and there are honourable members here who formerly were local councillors and can attest to the fact, that if one wants to be an effective local councillor in this day and age it is almost impossible to be a full-time employee in the work force at the same time. Therefore, we find that people who are self-employed, unemployed or working part time tend to dominate in local councils and that ordinary workers, whatever level of the work force they are at, find it very difficult to participate in local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect this is one of the reasons it is a problem: we actually have a lot of people in local government who are self-employed. I raise this as an issue to be thought about because clearly many of us would have reservations about full-time, paid councillors and the like, particularly in council areas with 10,000 people. It would be a bit absurd to have paid councillors at that level. But this is a problem for our democratic structures at local government level; many people are in effect prevented from participating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, an issue that deserves consideration is the fact that the superannuation tax concession as currently structured effectively favours higher income earners. In the broader picture of tax reform it needs to be kept in mind that the effective beneficiaries of that tax concession are higher income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and finally, I want to talk in some detail about the question that has occupied my mind in the superannuation context for quite some time&mdash;I urge honourable members to give consideration to it also&mdash;and that is that our current occupational superannuation structure is inadequate. It is a major improvement on what we had in 1983. A much larger proportion of the community now has access to superannuation than was the case in 1983. It has been a very substantial step forward from when this government first took office when roughly 45 per cent of the work force had access to superannuation. Overwhelmingly, the better-off parts of the work force were covered by superannuation and people such as the workers whom I as a union official used to represent, by and large, did not have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a major improvement, but the vehicle that has been used has had its deficiencies. Because it has been through award based superannuation&mdash;for pragmatic reasons it has been adopted as a vehicle to spread superannuation across the work force&mdash;we now have a number of anomalies. The one that has been referred to today is just one of those. I would like to refer to a few others because I am a supporter of a national superannuation scheme. I believe that the current arrangements we have should be seen as a stepping stone to a more comprehensive and more equitable superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable members that in 1975 the Hancock inquiry recommended a comprehensive national superannuation scheme along the lines of schemes that exist in some other countries in the OECD. Unfortunately, for various reasons, this scheme was rejected in the Senate and became one of the widely touted 21 bills that were advertised around the place. I cannot quite recollect the phrase, but I think it was something like Labor's 21 bills that will enslave Australia or imprison Australia. I still have the booklet at home. It is quite an extraordinary document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the opposition of the day and the current opposition, in 1975 we were on the verge of a totalitarian state in this country and that part of this totalitarian plot was going to be a national superannuation scheme. I urge the opposition to give more mature consideration to these issues. I think it would find that some of the anomalies, such as the one it raised today, in the current arrangements would be cured by moving to a national superannuation scheme&mdash;not necessarily precisely on the same basis as the Hancock inquiry recommended. We have probably learnt a few things since then that we could accommodate in a new national superannuation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the following deficiencies in the existing arrangements could and would be remedied by moving to a more comprehensive scheme. It is obviously inequitable. If one works part time or one is intermittently in the work force, as many women are, or one is a casual, obviously less in contributions will be made on one's behalf. Obviously, it is better for higher income earners, because superannuation is on a percentage basis, so their superannuation will end up reflecting their level of income when they are in the work force. Those people are also most likely to have built up private assets to rely on in retirement anyway as a result of their higher income status while earning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is administratively complex. It does not cover people who are self-employed. It does not cover people who are employed but not covered by any awards other than through the superannuation guarantee scheme. As a result, there are different categories of people in different arrangements all around the place. The government is still grappling with the small contributions problem where, because people are casual or intermittent workers, their contributions get eaten up in administrative charges in the funds that they are in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a serious problem with lack of membership control. As a former union official, I do not believe in the current structure of half employers and half union representatives. I believe that the trustees should simply be elected by the members of the fund and that neither employers nor union representatives should have any automatic right to be trustees of the individual funds. If a union is good enough to represent its members in that sphere, then, as happened in one instance with my union, an official will be elected by the members of that fund into that sort of position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a lack of options for members in determining where investment goes. In this country the key economic decisions are being made by bodies like National Mutual and AMP on behalf of people like me who have money in occupational superannuation funds such as CARE, of which I am a member, which is run by AMP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no say as to how the economic power of my little bit of that superannuation fund is actually wielded by AMP. Equally, I have no ability to say, `Look, I'd like my money to be invested in Australia, even if that means there might be a slightly lower than optimum return', or, `No, I don't want my money invested in particular types of investment because I am ethically opposed to those types of investments'. So there is a clear lack of ability for customer choice in those cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other problems. Litigation of total and permanent disablement claims is a serious problem that needs to be examined. Although the government has done the right thing in setting up a tribunal to deal with superannuation problems, unfortunately, it has left this area outside the scope of the tribunal. It is still within the scope of state supreme courts, which makes it practically impossible for people to get effective justice in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing with a complex area. I certainly have no problem with the fact that the honourable member for Wannon has raised this issue today. But I urge opposition members to look at this question more broadly, to recognise that we need to have a system in this country that provides full superannuation for everybody, and to do it in another way. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) (Exemption of Council Allowances) Amendment Bill 1993 has been brought forward by the shadow minister for local government, Senator Ian Macdonald, and is ably supported by my colleague the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker). I join him in this regard. This is an issue which is very important to my area. I have had strenuous representations from many local government bodies on this issue. The shire of Strathfieldsaye, the shire of Newstead, the town of St Arnaud, the city of Maryborough, the rural city of Marong, the shire of Maldon, the shire of Korong, the shire of Kara Kara, the borough of Eaglehawk, the shire of Huntly, the shire of Bet Bet, the shire of Tullaroop, and the Municipal Association of Victoria have all made representations to me on this matter which is affecting local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to a statement put out by the former minister for local government the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons) on 2 July 1992. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Local Government, David Simmons, said today</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition claims that councils would be required to make superannuation contributions on allowances paid to all elected members were incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA>We now find that the government has been tardy in correcting this anomaly. The claim made by the honourable member for Calare&mdash;and I believe that he is a genuine and honourable man&mdash;was made so at the time in the correct way, but regrettably, the government has not supported him in correcting this anomaly. His statement of 2 July 1992 continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"As far as Local Government is concerned, the new superannuation contributions will apply only to Brisbane City councillors who are in receipt of salaries," he said.</PARA>
<PARA>All the councils in my area have written to me to highlight the anomaly that exists and the fact that we are in effect penalising those who seek to serve the community as local government representatives. They really gain very little in remuneration. Most of these people serve purely in an honorary sense. They are at the beck and call of their local government ratepayers and they spend an enormous amount of time in fulfilling the needs of local government throughout their municipalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of their time, of course, is devoted to going out and inspecting problems and issues which arise in their own riding or municipality. They are always out of pocket. One can hardly call the small allowance they receive adequate remuneration for the tasks they perform. The councils also miss out in this regard because they have to carry the extra costs of the compulsory superannuation contributions. So the ratepayers are affected as well because of the council having to pick up the costs that are incurred as a result of those contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the administration of some superannuation funds, because the amount of remuneration is small and the contributions are also small, when the money goes into that fund the charges that are levied against the fund often exceed the benefit. So year after year the costs of disposing of the responsibilities of the superannuation fund mount up and the benefits at the end of it all are virtually nil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the then minister for local government the honourable member for Calare responded to the opposition's concerns about this, he was quite incorrect in saying that the only local government area that it would apply to would be the Brisbane city councillors who are paid some form of salary. He did not properly investigate the impact this would have on local government throughout Australia. We now find that local government is being penalised as a result of the government's inaction on this particular matter. That has been the motivation for Senator Ian Macdonald bringing forward the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) (Exemption of Council Allowances) Amendment Bill 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most councillors&mdash;I can speak with some experience having observed the councillors in my own electorate over many years&mdash;in reality, are not in the job full time. They work as part-time people in the council. Nevertheless, they devote an enormous amount of time to it, many of them spending every night out at meetings on behalf of ratepayers and countless weekends out on inspections. Their main source of income is their own business activities or employment. As a result, they have lost the ability to deduct private superannuation contributions. They are being disadvantaged for their voluntary service to the community. Volunteer service is one thing we should never lose in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two great organisations that I can speak of in Victoria. The first is local government, with the thousands of hours that those involved give voluntarily to the community, and the other is the Country Fire Authority, which has about 125,000 members who perform volunteer firefighting services in the state of Victoria. I liken the community service of local government very much to the activities of those firefighting services. Those volunteers fit in their training, dedication and service to the community in their spare time. Local government is identical to this because people involved there are providing a service to the ratepayers and the tiny amount of allowance they receive really could hardly be classified as remuneration. I think this is where this bill really seeks to correct that anomaly and put it back into a proper context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All local government councillors that I know, particularly in rural areas, would be many hundreds of dollars out of pocket&mdash;probably more by the time they run a motor vehicle and do all of the jobs they are required to do in local government and be representative on a whole range of committees looking after the community's interests. To lose their ability to deduct private superannuation contributions because their main source of income is some other private activity or business activity imposes a double penalty on them. They really are very disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that has been brought forward by Senator Ian Macdonald does have the total support of the Municipal Association of Victoria. It made very strenuous representations to me, as did all of my local councils, to have this anomaly corrected. I also understand that the Local Government Association of Queensland is strongly in support of this motion. Councillors and aldermen whose substantive form of employment or work is not with a council of which they are members and whose payment reflects this reality cannot be considered as employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to the original statement of the minister at the time, we will see that he really summed up the situation. It was not the intention of that minister to in fact take all councillors into that great net and for the legislation to affect their superannuation contributions. The honourable member made it quite clear in his statement of 2 July 1992 that he believed that that should apply to only the Brisbane city councillors. I strongly support the bill that has been brought forward by the shadow minister, Senator Macdonald. I wish to support the comments on this bill made by the honourable member for Wannon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the intent of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) (Exemption of Council Allowances) Amendment Bill, as I welcome the intention of the shadow minister for local government and the Australian Capital Territory, Senator Ian Macdonald. Most importantly, I welcome the intervention of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) in his capacity as the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services. His intervention in this matter will certainly produce results in terms of a review of the decision within the government. I am informed by the minister's office that a letter has been forwarded to each of the local government associations around the country, stating the concern that the Deputy Prime Minister has about this issue, how that concern is being reflected across the government backbench and how a review will be under way within the office of the Treasurer (Mr Willis).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this makes a very important point about the role of elected people in local government. Coming from a local government background, one thing I have learnt is that we should always declare our interest in these things. So I am very mindful of the fact that I am the only member of this parliament who still serves in an elected capacity in local government. I will be serving as the Mayor of Liverpool and a councillor in that local government area until the end of 1994. I am well aware of the great interest and concern throughout local government in New South Wales about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That concern is irrespective of location of the councils or the political composition of those councils, but it does make the point about the importance of local government in our federal system of government. In a meeting of the heads of government in Hobart last Friday, federalism was under review. Of course, local government did not achieve a great deal of attention or scrutiny in that process. But, through this legislation, we can at least say something in our federal system about the role of the elected person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the opinion that the Australian Taxation Office should not classify allowances as taxable income. I am also of the opinion that it should not classify elected people in local government as employees for the purposes of the superannuation guarantee levy. We need to encourage a cross-section of our community to take a role in local government. As my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) pointed out, if we made a survey of each of the local government authorities around Australia, we would find collectively and in most individual cases disproportionate representation of men, of older people, of those from an English-speaking background and also of those who have business interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to foster a genuinely representative cross-section in local government throughout the country, we need to make sure that local government is seen to be an attractive activity for people who have an interest in their local democracies. Of course, that extends to the conditions that relate to allowances and their taxation treatment by this government. It is a disincentive for certain groups of people to become involved in local government when these disadvantages are raised regarding any private superannuation arrangements they hold in their regular place of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point concerns the expenses that flow to councils. This is, quite substantially, an extra burden on the administration and costs of every local government authority in the country. We need to be mindful of the way in which local government has been squeezed for finances by federal and state governments for many decades and how this measure, when reviewed by the government, can assist in easing the burden of financial cost for local government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government review. I am sure that, following the representations that have been made by government members, it will lead to better consideration of these issues in making local government an attractive activity for people who have an interest at the local level and will make sure that council costs, through administration and the payments through to the superannuation levy, are kept to an absolute minimum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think most members of this House would have some awareness of the great sacrifices made by elected people in local government. I am always reminded of a story in my own local government authority of a councillor who was rung on Christmas Day about a pothole. He was howled down by the irate ratepayer who could not understand why the council would not take any action on Christmas Day on the problem he was experiencing in his street. With local government it is much more than a cliche that elected people are very close to the public; they are so close that the issues of local government administration can even infringe on holy days, such as Christmas Day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to have good regard for the efforts of those people serving across the country to make sure that local government is both efficient and responsive to community needs. If we can do that through making local government an attractive activity, then I think we do a great service not only to the federal system of government in Australia but also to the wellbeing and effectiveness of local government authorities in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government also has under review the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. I welcome again the intervention of the Deputy Prime Minister in this regard as it recognises the role played by local government. Each year 809 councils across Australia spend combined resources of close to $10 billion. That is a very significant amount of money, both in the effectiveness of the services they deliver and making sure that ratepayers receive value for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, quite sensibly, is dovetailing those issues against the review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986. I urge all honourable members to take an interest in the discussion paper that has been produced by the government as part of the Australian urban and regional development review and the way in which we need to have close scrutiny of the operations of the grants commissions in our states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The discussion paper points out that two models of horizontal equalisation are being followed: one by Western Australia and Queensland and the other by New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and, to a lesser extent, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. In the latter group an increasing share of funds has been allocated since 1986-87 to councils with increasing populations. In Queensland and Western Australia, funds have gone increasingly to councils with declining and stable populations. An analysis of the grant distribution was also conducted on the basis of the ABS index of relative socioeconomic disadvantage. In most states an increasing share of financial assistance grants have been going to councils with the highest socioeconomic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;and this is of great concern&mdash;the investigation has shown that in the state of Victoria the highest share of grants from the Grants Commission goes to the least disadvantaged councils. We can no longer tolerate a situation where federal funding is being distributed by state grant commissions through totally different criteria and with totally different outcomes across the nation. I look forward to the way in which the Deputy Prime Minister's review will produce a much more equitable outcome, reflecting the need to have uniformity in these local government arrangements across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, having welcomed the intent of this legislation&mdash;and I am sure the government review will be productive&mdash;I would just state my surprise at the fashion in which this legislation has come before the parliament. It is not inappropriate legislation, it is not incorrect or inaccurate legislation, but it is surprising because it has come from the opposition. There is now a wide appreciation in the parliament of how the opposition has given up on any constructive contribution to the wellbeing of the nation and to the administration of government at a federal level. Its sole focus is going to be on personalities, on questioning the legitimacy of this government and going back to the time-honoured methods of conservative parties&mdash;that is, engaging in muckraking of the sort that I am sure we will see in question time this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of great concern that the opposition has given up on any constructive contribution, although on the government side we look forward to the way in which this will, again, focus the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his total unsuitability for the populist style now being pioneered. This could well be the opposition's final  positive contribution on the question of local government and the superannuation levy. It is hoped that honourable members opposite restore a genuine interest in a positive contribution to government and make sure that we see more of these measures coming through instead of the sort of populist, muckraking tactics that the opposition now seems concerned about, more than any positive contribution they can make to the parliament and the nation. </PARA>

I thought it was somewhat contradictory for the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to give the opposition a bit of a serve, and then at the end of his speech to give some compliments. At the same time as he was criticising us for playing the man, he did save some pretty solid comments for the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of life is that this legislation has been handled tardily by the government, and discriminates against local government. The honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) have outlined this matter very clearly. I, of course, support and congratulate the shadow minister in the other place for the effort put up. Discussions this morning with the Local Government Association of South Australia showed that its members were quite clearly aggravated by the government's neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member opposite talked about the Australian Taxation Office. This is not a matter for the tax office but a matter for the parliament. How long are we going to hide behind the tax office? It is summed up quite clearly by the Local Government Association of South Australia in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Association strongly objects to Local Government allowances being interpreted as `salary or wages' to attract the Superannuation Guarantee Charge or in any other circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>As an aside, I was a little curious with the honourable member for Werriwa's comment that he was still in local government, the mayor of his particular electorate. My advice before the last election was that, being an elected representative claiming profit under the Crown, I had to resign. I hope the honourable member is not in dereliction of some statute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue here is whether the parliament wants to recognise local government. When speaking about that, we can have all the flowery phrases we like&mdash;and we get so eloquent in this place&mdash;but it has taken us at least two years after the minister has said that no one would be affected, and after the government has said it will introduce legislation. If that is not showing contempt for local government, what else is? The report on the review of the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act was previously mentioned by the honourable member, quoting some tables and making reference to some issues raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also reference to efficiency. If ever there was something that clouded and was a simple little example of the inefficiencies which the federal government applied to local government, surely this is it. It is a rather patronising, arrogant attitude from this level of government towards that other sphere of government. I find it totally unacceptable, having spent nearly six years in local government. Due to the fact that I was a candidate for this place, I could not continue. That was of some regret to me&mdash;apparently the previous member who spoke found a way around that. But after six years I find this attitude totally contemptuous of local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member then had the hide to criticise us for the way we carried on. Surely it is for the government to recognise&mdash;and it is pleasing that some members have&mdash;that it is the opposition that is pleased to take the positive move on this, but after the government has had a couple of years to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could talk at some length about the deficiencies of superannuation, particularly for people on casual wages. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) referred to some issues in that regard. The way this superannuation legislation works is ludicrous in those circumstances. It is a wasteful, lose-lose situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the status of the self-employed person compared with the ordinary worker. In my experience in local government there have been great steps forward in trying to bring people whose lifestyle is tied to the wages and salaries component into local government, and I welcome that. I would not like to see self-employed people denigrated because they make that extra effort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This private member's bill, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) (Exemption of Council Allowances) Amendment Bill, is completely unnecessary, although the policy prescription that it recommends is absolutely correct. The government is looking at this issue. Members of the government backbench have already done the hard work on this issue and have made the necessary recommendations to the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). I and many other members from Queensland have taken this matter up with the Treasurer; it affects many representatives of local government right throughout my state. A decision on this matter is expected in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the existing provisions penalise many hardworking council representatives who have, over the years, provided for their own superannuation needs. Currently councillors who receive allowances are deemed to be employees and their monthly allowances are deemed to be salary and wages. These councillors who receive minor meeting allowances pay the superannuation guarantee levy and, as a consequence of that, this precludes them from claiming on their tax return the appropriate deductions which many other self-employed people are entitled to. In effect, many councillors will be discouraged&mdash;indeed, penalised&mdash;from claiming tax deductions on their contributions to their superannuation savings. In that sense this measure discourages saving in the broader community, which is why the government is dealing with the anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More broadly, it is hypocritical for the opposition to come into this House and talk about the concept of national savings when the only positive policy proposal that has been put forward in this House deals with councillors. We have not seen in any of the economic debates in recent times any concrete proposals from the opposition to increase national savings. When we have debated issues to do with increasing national savings and when we have debated the superannuation guarantee and many other facets of our superannuation arrangements, we have had a barrage of negativity from those opposite who are absolutely opposed to doing something about our national savings and to encourage people in the community to receive superannuation benefits. The opposition has no policies in these areas at all. It is constantly attacking the government for the superannuation proposals that have been put forward, instead of applauding the approach of the government which will increase savings in the community and encourage workers to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all recognise that the superannuation guarantee will achieve a higher level of self-provided retirement income for virtually all employees. When this measure was introduced it was vigorously attacked by those opposite who, when they were attacking our approach, decided to bring in a 15 per cent GST which would have automatically devalued the savings of many Australians, particularly those who were close to retirement. The fact is that these measures generally promote greater domestic saving and that assists the government in dealing with the problem of the current account deficit and in achieving much higher rates of growth&mdash;job growth as well&mdash;in the context of our overall economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2005 the superannuation guarantee will increase GDP by approximately 0.7 per cent or about $3 billion in current values. Within 40 years it will increase GDP by approximately 1.25 per cent or $5 billion in terms of current values. The fact that there is one minor anomaly which discriminates against a small section of the work force does not mean that the government's overall approach to superannuation matters is not deserving of very substantial support. The problem that we on this side have with the approach of the opposition is that in one very small area of superannuation policy it can produce only one positive proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If bills or private members' bills that came from the Senate dealt with broader questions of national savings and broader questions of changes to the superannuation arrangements, then those opposite might have some credibility in this area, but currently they have none. The hard work has been done on this issue by members of the government backbench, in terms of representations to the Treasurer, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and all of those concerned. I personally look forward to some changes in this area which will remove the discrimination that is taking place against a small but important number of local councillors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> suggested that the report I have just tabled was going to be a whitewash. At the time I did not respond to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> because to have done so not only would have been a breach of the rules of this place but also would have prejudiced the committee's deliberations. Now that the report is tabled, I can make it quite clear that the report is a balanced and judicious statement that is very critical of the way in which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and the Territories (Mrs Kelly) administered the program. The report goes as far as the evidence allows and as far as is required by the committee. In so doing, it is anything but a whitewash. The journalists responsible need to be more perceptive in their assessment of parliamentary language.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is the outcome of the committee's review of a report from the Auditor-General. In its review of the audit report, the committee has concentrated on the key issues raised by the Auditor-General. Before discussing the report, I would like to lay to rest some of the false claims that have been made about the committee and the inquiry. It has been suggested that the report was referred to the committee in an attempt to either bury it or to smother it with the weight of the numbers of the government majority on the committee. Clearly this was not the case. The Auditor-General's report was referred to the committee in the same way that we have had other audit reports referred; that is, simply because it related to activities which are amongst the issues covered by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set out to deal with it in the way that we have dealt with the others. There is nothing extraordinary or unusual about that. In fact, I consider that it is very necessary for such reports to be referred to committees to ensure accountability in the administration of government programs. As far as the numbers and composition of the committee is concerned, I can only point out that this was determined in the usual way after the last election, long before the audit report was tabled. The only change of membership that has occurred since the committee was appointed has been that the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Cameron) has replaced the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the opposition claims in its dissenting report that the inquiry was less than thorough. This is simply unreasonable. It was only at the last minute that the opposition called for additional witnesses to appear. We heard evidence from more witnesses than would normally have been heard in such an inquiry, including all the main actors such as the minister and the departmental head. All the central issues were extensively canvassed. More detail would have added nothing important to the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the report. The committee has examined the audit report and the matters raised by the Auditor-General with a view to ensuring that the accountability requirements of the House are satisfied and that both the department and the minister are responding fully to the Auditor-General's findings. The Auditor-General had two main concerns: the departmental administration of the program and the public accountability of the minister and her staff for their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first matter, the committee was initially concerned that the department was not inclined to accept that it had to make a serious response to the audit findings. This was disturbing for two reasons. Firstly, the department's administration had been seriously deficient and it clearly could have learnt a great deal from the audit. Secondly, although all the decisions about allocating the funds had been made, there was still a great deal to be done to finalise payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As our review progressed, the secretary to the department made it clear that the department's response to the audit recommendations was not as glib as it first appeared. The committee has been told that the audit recommendations are now being taken seriously, that they are accepted and that they are being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been agreed with the minister that, should a new funding round be introduced, substantially different and improved procedures will apply and more resources will be applied to administration. This will increase the administrative overheads of the program, which in the past has been run at very low administrative cost. It is accepted by the department that some increase in these costs is necessary.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any future administration, the department will have the benefit of a best practice guide for the administration of grants, which the Australian National Audit Office is developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the Auditor-General was concerned about the public accountability of the minister for her administrative decisions. This issue also became a major focus of our inquiry. The Auditor-General addressed other questions of bias and incompetence but, as he stressed, these cannot be answered without reliable evidence and the minister's failure to keep adequate records means that there is no such documentary evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are inferences and indirect suggestions of bias in the allocation of grants. In fact, the inference of bias is very strong, but it is still only an inference. It is quite possible that those electorates which received the largest amounts of grants may have been the most in need. We can go no further than the Auditor-General in this and in other questions, and therefore we keep coming back to the question of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General proposed that, as a minimum, public accountability require that administrative processes should be fair and open, that decisions should be based on principle and supported by documented reasons, and that those involved in making decisions should be accountable for those decisions. In relation to the minister's administration of the sports facilities program, the committee concluded that she did not approach the minimum standard in relation to supporting her decisions with documented reasons, that her record keeping was seriously inadequate and that her administration was deficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have recommended a series of measures that will, if adopted, make the administration of the program more transparent, particularly in relation to the decisions about which projects are to be funded. Our recommendations will make it much easier for the minister to make decisions and to document her reasons. Specifically, we recommend that, first, before any new round of funding is commenced, the department undertake an analysis of the need for cultural, recreation and sporting facilities to provide a reasonable basis for the allocation of funds to proposed projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, we recommend that in all future grants programs the department provide a schedule of applications that evaluates the proposed projects and contains recommendations to guide the minister's decisions. Third, we recommend that the grant application form be redesigned to provide information that will allow the department to numerically rate proposed projects against each other and that the criteria be weighted so that an overall rating can be calculated for each application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourth, we recommend that the numerical ratings against the individual criteria, and the overall rating, be included in schedules of applications provided to the minister, and that the minister consider these ratings when making decisions about which applications to fund. Fifth, where additional information is obtained and the ratings are amended by the minister, the schedules should be annotated and the additional information added to the file. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the measures we have recommended had been in place the minister would not now have any difficulty in proving that her decisions were justified and the Auditor would have found a very obvious audit trail. She would not now be facing the criticisms that have been levelled at her if she had properly documented the reasons for her decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee noted that there were no significant suggestions of fraud or misappropriation arising from the Auditor-General's report. The minister's actions were not illegal. Although her administration was clearly deficient, the committee does not recommend to the House that the minister be censured. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;It is unusual for there to be a dissenting report from inquiries conducted by the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;there is very little history indeed. That demonstrates the seriousness with which the coalition members took their decision to submit a dissenting report in this instance. This has been a major national issue that has attracted a great deal of attention. But, more importantly, this report is a watershed on issues like parliamentary accountability, ministerial responsibility and accountability for decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is indeed critical of many aspects of the way in which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has administered this program. It probably is the most damning report that has been brought down about a minister in modern times. But, in spite of documenting a clear-cut case against the minister for failing to administer her responsibilities efficiently and well, the majority report has stopped short of recommending a censure. The Auditor-General, in a letter to the committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are very well aware that care needs to be taken to avoid anything that would weaken public confidence in the processes of government and which could result in damage to the standing of the Parliament as an effective reviewer&mdash;on behalf of the voters . . . This would raise the danger of reinforcing any cynicism in the community about the political process. It is clear that your report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is writing to the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be an important benchmark in asserting the contemporary role of parliament in our democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A weakening of the processes of accountability of Government programs will be difficult to reverse. New and lower standards could then apply to future governments of whatever political persuasion. This would be a tragedy for all political parties and indeed for the strength of our democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General has laid down very clearly that this committee of inquiry had a particular responsibility to uphold high standards. It is not, therefore, enough to be merely critical of the past administration of the program. The dissenters believe it is necessary to bring to account those who have failed in the past. So it is our view that censure against the minister is warranted and required if this parliament is going to stand up and not ensure that new and lower standards become entrenched in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry conducted by the committee was less than a thorough public examination of the issues raised in the Auditor-General's report. Only two witnesses were called. It is true that the minister also appeared of her own volition. Of those two witnesses, one was Mr Stuart Hamilton, the current secretary to the department, who took office only after the grants were distributed. So it was difficult to come to grips with many of the issues of concern that were raised through these public inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, many of the witnesses we heard were unable to address many of the issues that have been raised in the community and which are causing grave concern. We would have liked to call a number of other witnesses. At the time that the coalition members of the committee moved motions to call people, which were defeated on party lines, it was our understanding that the report would not be put before this parliament until perhaps the last week of sittings. In other words, there was plenty of time when the coalition took those steps. What has happened subsequently is that, every time the committee has met, this reporting time has been brought forward, seemingly in an effort to curtail the committee inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many serious issues of accountability and the misuse of funds for political purposes have been raised in this report. The fact that the standing committee has not been as comprehensive in its inquiry as it should have been will heighten demands for a full public independent inquiry into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General laid down clear standards that need to be met in the administration of a program. It is true that the committee's majority report acknowledges that the minister's administration has been deficient. But we believe that, on the evidence, it would be reasonable to add the word `incompetent'. We are completely satisfied that the Auditor-General is correct in his assertion that there are insufficient records to support the minister's actions and statements regarding the program or to justify the selections that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from a minute written by Ms Dal Bon that the department was also concerned about the administration of the program and was anxious to protect itself from potential accusations of maladministration. It is particularly a matter of concern that Ms Dal Bon believed that the poor system of management of this program had `been handed down from on high'. Indeed, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the minister avoided taking action to improve the accountability in this program so that the decision making process could not then be easily scrutinised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has acknowledged the poor standard of administration in the past and has promised to adopt better standards in the future. But she cannot be absolved from her past culpability merely by promising to do better in the future. The Auditor-General said in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is generally accepted in modern government that ministers are responsible for matters for which they have a personal involvement or where they fail to correct systemic failure within the portfolio of which they are aware.</PARA>
<PARA>In this instance, the minister is responsible for the failings within her department. But she adopted a hands-on approach to this program. She was personally involved in the selection process. She must, therefore, be held responsible for the inadequacies and gross deficiencies outlined in the Auditor-General's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories should resign. If she fails to do so, the parliament should demonstrate its commitment to the proper standards of management and accountability by calling on her to resign. It will not be sufficient in an incident like this for her merely to be moved to another portfolio. She has demonstrated an inability to manage a department and must resign altogether, unless this House and this government are going to accept that newer and lower standards should apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter of considerable concern to the signatories to the dissenting report is the question of political bias. The Auditor-General, in our view, was unnecessarily circumspect in merely saying that claims of bias could not be put to rest. In my clear view, and in the view of my fellow coalition members of the committee, adequate evidence is now on the public record to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt that this program was administered in a way that was politically partisan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have listed 20 separate reasons why that claim can be substantiated. One may argue that each one of them in itself is not conclusive proof, but when all 20 are added together it is impossible to come to any reasonable conclusion other than that this particular program was used and refined as part of the government's marginal seat election strategy, and that the grants were used to seek electoral advantage. The minister should also be censured for her misuse of taxpayers' funds for political purposes. To fail to censure Minister Kelly would be to condone new and lower standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue of considerable concern. Most observers believe that a strengthened House of Representatives committee system would greatly enhance this parliament. However, the House of Representatives committees will be seen to be ineffective in dealing with politically sensitive issues if we are unable to agree on recommendations of censures in cases such as this. Instead of strengthening the House of Representatives committees, this has weakened the system, and sensitive issues are likely to be increasingly directed to Senate committees, where government majorities are not so readily able to dominate, irrespective of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a difficult inquiry for the committee, and no doubt there has been some considerable rancour on occasions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House notes with concern the urgent need to provide security and certainty for older Australians planning for their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker, I know that you and other members of this House appreciate that the elderly citizens who come to our offices have worries and concerns about their retirement and what they are going to do for the future. It is not only the people who come into our offices. We all have experience with our own relatives and with the concerns that they have. It seems to me that the older we get, the more we worry about things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a population of 17.6 million people, there are approximately 2.4 million aged people; that is, women over 60 and men over 65. I am approaching that age, so I do not like to call people over 60 aged, but that seems to be the terminology of the day. Of these, 77.2 per cent or 1.5 million are pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated that by the year 2031 there will be between 5.1 and 5.2 million people over the age of 65, making up 20 to 22 per cent of the total population&mdash;a rise from 13.7 per cent to 20 to 22 per cent. In the last 20 years the numbers of people over the age of 80 has increased by 118 per cent and this is set to continue. I know that all political parties are very concerned about this and, in their own ways, are trying to make sure that these people as they come to retirement age in increasing numbers can have certainty that their reasonable to good standard of living will be maintained. This is not only a problem in Australia but a problem right throughout the Western world. That band of the population is becoming older on the back of a decreasing birth rate, amongst other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, in its move to do something about providing retirement incomes, has brought in the superannuation guarantee levy. I know that it has made a gallant attempt to try to make sure that people in their retirement do have security. But, unfortunately, from my experience in my electorate, I know there are a number of problems with the guarantee levy. The information being received from some of the superannuation experts is highlighting the biggest problem. A good article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 22 March in part says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For anyone aged 25 or more, the SGC will not be enough for them to comfortably retire on. Some actuaries go so far as to suggest that the average worker should be putting away at least 16 per cent of their salary each year for some 40 years just to maintain their present living standards in retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>That says a great deal. If this superannuation guarantee levy is kept in place, it will mean that no-one, particularly someone my age or younger, can really be secure in the knowledge that when they retire they will have enough to retire on. So people are going to have to look elsewhere to try to boost that funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem is that there does not seem to be any incentive today for people to put away for their retirement. When people on independent incomes get to the age of retirement they find that everything seems to work against them. They have to pay for this and they have to pay for something else. They are certainly not living to the same standard as other people. People are asking the question more and more: is it worth while for me to try to save for myself in retirement or should I just allow the government to do it for me and run the risk? Certainly in our democracy there is no way that we should see aged people disadvantaged, although the way we are going at the moment we could very well come to the situation where, no matter what we would like to do, we just will not be able to afford to care for those people who really need assistance in their old age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current superannuation law is complex and confusing. I think it is up to the federal government to reinvestigate the superannuation guarantee levy, have a look at the whole situation and come up with something that is much more simple. It seems to me that, as time goes by, for people planning for their retirement, it is like playing a game of football where the rules or the goalposts keep changing: they are not quite sure where they are going or what they are doing. I think it is very important for those people, as they approach old age, to know what they are really up for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do not use our aged people as a valuable asset, if I could use that expression, enough. This is the International Year of the Family and we have been talking about the problems we are facing in Australia such as the family breakdown, which is caused by a number of things. Perhaps it is too easy now for partners to walk away from each other. Governments seem to support people in families that are breaking up. We now have the situation where half a million children are living with only one parent. Grandparents in particular are now having to take on the role not only of grandparents but of parents. I think that is a shame. I do not know what a lot of children would do if those grandparents were not there. This is particularly so in some cultural groups where, in the extended family, the grandparents have a major role to play. Even if families do not break up, I think there is a need for the elderly and the young to get together so that the young know what their heritage is and the elderly citizens still feel that they have a role to play. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk lately about euthanasia. I will be quite blunt about it: I am totally opposed to euthanasia in any way. But I notice that it rears its ugly head now and again. I think some newspaper offices have a filing system in which the Chandler-Bogle affair is at the front, then there are the sharks and then there is the Donald Mackay affair and so on. These issues just keep coming forward and being pulled out, and I think euthanasia is one of them. Those people who are keen on euthanasia keep raising the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As years go by, I think we have to be very careful. If we are not in a position where we can care for our elderly citizens, this pressure will mount. It is up to us as a parliament, and for the public, to keep a very close eye on that. With all the best intentions in the world, when this problem of taking caring of our elderly citizens starts to magnify, we will have major difficulties in front of us. I think we will all have to be very much on our guard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Senate committee report was released recently on the effects of the proposed treatment of unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities under the income test for pensioners. One of my colleagues, who has just come back from his electorate, was told by a veteran who bought some shares late last year that his pension was affected because of the amount of the unrealised capital gains provisions for the year 1992-93. So, having just bought the shares, he now finds that he can no longer collect his pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the committee was unanimous in its findings that the government's costings were invalid in that particular investigation. The proposed method of calculating unrealised capital gains and losses was not fair and equitable. Treatment of the various types of pensioner and veteran investments under the relevant income and assets test was inequitable. The piecemeal application of a measure of this type will create more inequity than it will save. As I said before, this certainly has had an effect on many pensioners and it will have an effect on many more. But what concerns me is the worry and concern of these pensioners when they come into my office. It is important that the government make sure that the feelings of the pensioners are taken care of, because the last thing we want to do is cause them to worry about their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I think it is about time that we once again looked into the matter of health care for pensioners. Before the last election, the coalition had a policy whereby pensioners could have access to private health facilities. I think that was very important. How often do we have people approaching us and saying, `I've been waiting to have a hip replacement for 18 months and I'm in terrible pain. I can't get into a public hospital.'? That is another area which we have to look at, as far as our aged people and our pensioners are concerned. We have to try to work out some way that we can free up the health system so that these people who need to have elective surgery can get into those institutions, have that surgery and get themselves out of the tremendous pain that they must be feeling. </PARA>

I welcome this motion because it provides the opportunity to outline some of the initiatives which the government has put in place in the last few years and to emphasise the priorities which this government gives to aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When speaking of older Australians, we are covering a wide range of citizens of this country. One could ask, `Who is an older Australian?'. The Older Women Network starts its membership at the age of 50. The Association of Independent Retirees comprises people sometimes even younger who have taken retirement packages in their late 40s right through to persons in their 60s and 70s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also acknowledge that many older Australians live long and fulfilling lives, and are well able to look after themselves and give back a great deal to the community. On the other hand, many older Australians spend the last few years of their lives in aged hostels and nursing homes. Australia has an excellent reputation throughout the world for the standard of its aged care. Having said this, I acknowledge that some of our nursing homes fall below the standards which we would desire, but the government is doing much to encourage improvement and rebuilding through its funding programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The words `security' and `certainty' seem to be paramount in the honourable member's motion. They can often be interpreted as not wanting change. My experience of the older people I have met in my electorate is quite different. For example, many older women who find themselves alone in their later years prove to be extremely adventurous, taking on new careers, training programs and voluntary work. Many of these women are also active in political life. A recent example is the action taken by two elderly women in my electorate who, in protest at the closing of a local bank, chained themselves to its doors. For many of these women their lives in the past have been centred on caring for a husband and children. When they are freed of these burdens, many of them blossom into areas they have not hitherto considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I realise that the honourable member's motion relates mainly to financial security and certainty, and the government has certainly not been wanting in this regard. Superannuation is something which has not been universal in the past and has often been the domain of the rich. I commend the government for ensuring that in future all working Australians will be covered by superannuation in their retirement. I am glad that the honourable member for Riverina agrees that this is a good policy. I share his concerns about the current administration of the program, particularly in relation to some of the funds. I, too, have had people coming to see me about the dreadful situation where they have been at a job for a short time and have found that all their contributions have gone in administration. But I am sure the government has taken note of that and that this issue will be further considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those who have the benefits of superannuation when they retire, there are a number of choices. Many people place their superannuation into managed investments. The government has acknowledged that, due to low interest rates, the return on these investments has dropped for many people. For this reason, last year the government made the income and assets limits for independent retirees more flexible, thus enabling more people to be eligible for part pensions. One of the most significant changes in this policy is the provision to all recipients of part pensions, regardless of how small those pensions are, of full fringe benefits such as concessions on rates, electricity, telephone, transport, motor vehicle registration and pharmaceutical benefits. Most of these fringe benefits were available from April 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seniors health card, shortly to be introduced, will be available to all people of pensionable age whose taxable incomes are below the pension cut-off point but who have not previously been eligible because of the assets test. This will entitle low income non-pensioners to purchase pharmaceuticals and hearing aids at the same concessional rate as pensioners. For those who remain in their homes of long standing but wish to carry out maintenance or improvements, the home equity conversion loans scheme provides an opportunity for loans which will not have to be repaid until the owners permanently vacate their home. I know of many older people in my electorate who have gladly taken up this offer. Another new initiative by this government is the introduction of the dental health program, which provides emergency services and some basic and preventive care to holders of health care cards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I previously mentioned, Australia has a fine record in the field of aged care. The home and community care program, HACC, which was introduced in the mid-1980s, provides care for older people in their own homes, thus alleviating or postponing the time when admission to a nursing home may be necessary. In the 1993-94 budget there was an increase in the number of community aged care packages, which provide hostel level care in people's own homes. The increase has been from five to 7.5 packages per 1,000 people aged 70 or more. Further funding has been provided to establish grants to help community organisations which provide aged care to disadvantaged communities. The budget is also providing through the aged care programs respite care for those who are being cared for at home by relatives or other carers. What did the opposition plan in its much vaunted Fightback package for these older Australians? It planned to impose a 15 per cent GST on all the essentials of their lives: rates, electricity, gas, water, clothes and fares. So much for certainty and security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these government initiatives which I have mentioned have been designed to improve financial security and access to services to older Australians. They build on major retirement income reforms of the past few years and are part of the continuing process of adapting the delivery of services and income support to best meet the needs and the capacities of a community as a whole. However, the government has recognised that the ways in which eligibility for pensions and other benefits is assessed is often complex, particularly in relation to income and assets tests. For this reason, the government has commissioned an independent review of pension income and assets tests which will fully examine both the policies and processes undertaken by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I and some of my colleagues met the consultant who will be leading the team which is undertaking this review.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel sure that its examination of the situation will be thorough and the outcomes will be positive. I have encouraged older people in my electorate to present submissions to the review. I certainly call on other members to do likewise. The consultants will be carrying out forums and contact groups with older people from a wide variety of communities. I think it will be very good for them to hear directly from those people instead of or in addition to representations made by local members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Devising policies which will suit all older Australians is an almost impossible task. As I have mentioned previously, people within these age categories find themselves in a wide range of situations and activities. I have several constituents well into their 80s who are keen to revolutionise many aspects of the way government works and to change particular policies. They could hardly be regarded as little old ladies and men sitting back in rocking chairs needing a blanket for security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My encounters with women in the Older Women Network certainly bear out this situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">EPAC's latest report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's ageing society</EMPHASIS> predicts that the number of aged people will rise from 1.9 million in 1991 to more than five million by the year 2051 when more than one person in five will be over the age of 65. There will be a sixfold increase in people aged 80 or over, from 373,000 to more than two million by 2051. According to one of the report's authors Ross Clare, this means that the proportion of the over-80s will jump from 2.2 per cent in 1991 up to eight per cent in 2051. Understandably, it is this age group which calls upon a disproportionate amount of resources via the public purse. The report also said that by 2051 part pensions will be needed to provide for about 75 per cent of the aged who will not be able to rely on adequate superannuation pay-outs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC report also raised serious implications for health care with total health care spending likely to increase from $29 billion in 1991 to $126 billion by 2051, with more than half of this spent on the elderly. Elderly Australians recognise that their health deteriorates with age. They are the ones who seek affordable private health insurance so that they can feel secure in the knowledge that they can have their choice of doctor and hospital in their time of need. Currently, they are faced with increasing premiums, but if they opt out they join public hospital queues. The so-called Richardson reforms currently under discussion do not address their problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all too easy when assessing health policy to see these people as statistics. In my own electorate I speak to pensioners and other financially disadvantaged older people who do without what many would call the necessities of life so that they can maintain private health insurance. For them, health care is then predictable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians are poor savers. To ensure that adequate funds are set aside for retirement requires a major cultural shift in attitude. However, the aged should not be seen as a burden on society. The total wealth of those retirees over 55 has been estimated at more than $200 billion. The elderly also provide significant financial and child-care assistance to their families and the bulk of care services to their fellow aged. Elderly wives and husbands make up 40 and 33 per cent respectively of the carer population, while daughters and sons represent only 15 and five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A 1982 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure stressed the need to redress the funding imbalance whereby institutional care was more heavily used than community based care. This resulted in the establishment of the HACC program in 1985. HACC aims to provide a range of integrated services allowing the frail aged to live in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, of which I am a member, has been conducting a public inquiry into HACC programs. A discussion paper has been released which raises many critical issues impacting upon our growing elderly population in their retirement. It says that it is clear there is a perception among consumers and providers of HACC services that some significant deficiencies remain in the integration and identity of the program and that these deficiencies limit the accessibility and effectiveness of HACC. It goes on to say that the committee has heard consistently that demand for HACC services far exceeds supply and that the gap is increasingly due to continued reductions in the rate of growth of HACC funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the HACC program, along with other programs providing assistance to the aged, is to be in a position to respond to the changes ahead over the next 50 or 60 years, some sensible planning must take place. The paper highlights issues such as the availability of volunteer carers, the movement of traditional carers into the work force, the level of involvement which should be expected from the aged in caring for spouses and relatives, the appropriateness of shifting the balance of care to the community and the level of financial responsibility the aged should take for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The age pension is seen as the cornerstone of independence in the retirement of older Australians, but there is now universal acknowledgment that it is cost prohibitive to provide a pension to all retirees regardless of income and assets. The long-term objective is for retirement income to ease the burden on age pension payments, which means that Australians must be encouraged to save and plan for their retirement. But this government sends all the wrong messages. The recent decision to treat unrealised capital gains on shares as pension income is the worst example of this. This unfair legislation implemented last September has discriminated against those elderly people who have displayed the necessary virtues of thrift, virtue and enterprise and planned for their retirement. The Australian Stock Exchange has described the legislation as flawed in principle, flawed in application and discriminatory against investment in listed shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with its changed treatment of managed investments, the bottom line is that part pensioners are given a conflicting message: squander your savings and sell your assets and then you will qualify for a pension. Counting rises in share values as income has caused untold uncertainty and financial hardship for thousands of independent retirees and part pensioners around Australia. Those who plan and seek independent retirement should not be penalised or disadvantaged as disincentives will push people into welfare dependency. </PARA>

Single pensioners pay no tax up to a threshold of $10,600 while those funding their own retirement pay no tax up to a threshold of $5,400. The FitzGerald report on national savings talked about the need to boost private savings in Australia. This requires clear policy direction about superannuation. The EPAC report suggested that a superannuation guarantee charge may not suit the least industrially powerful&mdash;women, self-employed and those who work on a casual basis&mdash;as it is geared only to those fortunate to have a typical male working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, there is a growing queue of around 300,000 long-term unemployed, with the gulf widening between the haves and the have-nots. What happens to the unemployed in their 50s with another two or three decades to live who are cast into early retirement and forced to live on their savings? What happens to women who spend fewer years than men in the work force and often have casual or part-time employment? They see their superannuation nest egg being eroded by superannuation fees. </PARA>

However, these changes have come too late for many women currently in the pension system. Despite that, we have seen a continuing rise in the numbers of those on the pension.

Many moteliers, bus companies and other parts of the tourist industry are focusing entirely on that older group of people. They have some financial security and are in a position to have leisure time. When people on the other side talk about the need for security and certainty, it is necessary to look very carefully at the kinds of payments which are available&mdash;the kinds of payments the aged and veterans pensions bring, and some of the other payments which have been made over the years to our war widows and to the elderly in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health care is another area that brings certainty to the ageing community. In Medicare, Australia indisputably has one of the best health care systems in the world.

With the development of the public health sector and demands on that, while I recognise that there are some waiting times for elective surgery, when people have strokes or serious heart conditions or cancer or whatever, they are taken into the system and provided with the whole range of services that are part of our Medicare system. Indeed, a recognition of the demand for the health card has come through much of the lobbying that was done by the senior citizens' groups and pensioner leagues over that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, from 1 July 1994, the Commonwealth seniors health card will give non-pensioner retirees access to the same Commonwealth health benefits that pensioners now get through their pensioner concession card. Holders of the Commonwealth seniors health card will get listed pharmaceuticals at the concessional price, cheaper rates on hearing aides and access to a two-phase dental service under the new Commonwealth dental health scheme. The card will benefit retired people who would qualify for an age pension under income test rules but who do not receive a pension because the values of their assets exceeds the assets test limit. The card will also benefit people who are entitled to get a small age pension but who choose not to claim it for personal reasons. Concessions offered under the seniors card are less generous than the full range available to pensioners in recognition of the higher level of assets owned by non-pensioner retirees. This initiative is a recognition that one of the major concerns for people in their later years is the whole question of health. </PARA>

Much of that is funded by the hospitals and home care service through our Medicare system. That enables people to leave hospital and go home but to have a level of care that ensures that they have a certain amount of independence. As well as that, they also have a better opportunity of recovering, if not to full health, certainly to a situation whereby they can manage in their own homes. All of us know that the research points very clearly to the fact that people who are ill and who return to their own homes will recover considerably more quickly because they find things familiar, they are in better surroundings and they are less distressed by the foreignness and alienness that sometimes comes from being in hospitals, no matter how caring and how wonderful the staff really are. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the question of security and certainty for older Australians, we need to look at the way in which they are valued and recognised within our community. Sometimes we spend a lot of time on the negatives rather than the positives.

In this regard I mention particularly a number of programs that are running in schools, including the adopt a granny or grandfather program</PARA>

That will also provide security and certainty because they can expect to be treated in a particular way. The nursing home standards also provide that security and certainty by ensuring that these people will be treated and that their care will be of a very high quality. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House notes with concern the urgent need to provide security and certainty for older Australians planning for their retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose there are two aspects to this motion. One is to look at the treatment of those who have retired in recent years. I assume the other is to look at those younger people who are planning for their retirement. Either way, retirement is a time that most people tend to look forward to, provided that it can be looked forward to with some degree of certainty. Everyone is entitled to be comfortable in retirement. However, for many people these days that apparently is not the case. It seems to me that ever since 1983, when the Labor government was elected, people have become less comfortable and less secure in their retirement. That is certainly the case for a lot of my constituents. The government has constantly chopped and changed its policy in respect of the treatment of people's retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate I have a very large number of independent retirees, or self-funded retirees, and they have suffered enormously in recent years. In fact, over the last 10 years or so, ever since the Labor Party was elected to government, changes have been made constantly to the treatment of various types of managed investments, investments in property trusts and, most recently, shares. We are talking about not only those who are totally self-funded but also a very large number of people receiving social security or veterans pensions who may have very small investments and who have found that the way the government has treated these investments has been extremely disadvantageous to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticism of the government&mdash;I notice that no government speaker has been prepared to defend this vigorously&mdash;is that over the last 10 years the government has constantly changed the goalposts. It has constantly changed the rules by which people are expected to play. It has changed them not only to make people who are attempting to plan for their retirement aware but also very often to give the rules a retrospective effect; in other words, retired people who believed they had some degree of certainty and some guarantee of comfort in their retirement have suddenly found that the rules have changed. Examples of that have been given so far in this debate this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every honourable member in this House would have received input from constituents who have called to point out the disastrous effect that the government's treatment of managed investments and shares has had on their incomes, particularly on their social security benefits. This has a marked effect for part-pensioners, who rely to some extent on investments that they have put aside during their working years and who access a part of a pension. They have found time after time that, because of some strange formula that the government has introduced&mdash;which even the most educated accountants, for example, have difficulty understanding&mdash;as their managed investments or share portfolios have increased in value that has led to a loss of pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have pointed out consistently how iniquitous the measurement of unrealised capital gains is&mdash;that is what we are talking about in this matter&mdash;and how unfortunate that is. We have debated this issue many times in this place but it is impossible for me to understand even to this day how unrealised capital gains can be treated as income. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members on both sides of the House need to work extremely closely together on this matter. I refer to a speech I made on a similar motion a couple of weeks ago in the House where I used the specific word `spongers'. It certainly instigated a great deal of discussion. I would like to bring some of that discussion to the House today, because it came from many retired persons throughout my electorate and throughout Australia. I have had the opportunity to listen to two sides of the argument. But there was opportunism by people on the benches opposite in the use of that one word, which more often than not was taken quite out of context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people have written to me and phoned me and said, `Well, at last somebody has stood up and exposed people who rort the pension system'. This message came across in two areas. It came across in one area where, as I have said earlier, a small minority of older Australians&mdash;I cannot bring the actual cases to the House because that is in confidence&mdash;are putting away hundreds of thousands of dollars and then applying for a pension. I am not speaking, and have never spoken, in the context of all pensioners because one day I will be a pensioner with superannuation and&mdash;hopefully, if I get there&mdash;some shares to fund my own retirement. But in the latest case, which comes from my state of Tasmania, somebody has just managed to hide away into the family millions of dollars and then apply for a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is absolutely disgusting. They are the spongers of our community, along with those who are getting the pension through unemployment. There are people claiming unemployment pensions but then going out and working in cash-in-hand jobs and making it a lot harder for others to get pensions. It is a fair go for all Australians. We do not need spongers in any part of the system. I stand by what I have said in this House&mdash;it is that small minority of spongers out there whom we need to eliminate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has been very good at instigating areas of discussion to expose those people. As the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) rightly said, the ageing agenda's team has just been given the initiative to review the rationale for the incomes and assets test in the context of the government's retirement income objectives. Along with the honourable member, I welcome that review. It certainly will expose the holes in the system that all members on this side of the house admit must be in various pieces of legislation. Over the last 10 to 11 years the government has created many good, positive initiatives, such as the ones mentioned earlier by the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm), in the areas of aged care, HACC, respite care and health. </PARA>

Along with the honourable member for Riverina and many of my colleagues, I too have some concern for the administration of those funds. We must listen to what people in our electorates say, we must care for older Australians but we must do it right. The honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) mentioned one of her constituents. I suggest that she look into the fact that those persons over 55 who are unable to claim pensions have avenues of assistance through the Department of Social Security so that they do not have to put in that claim every fortnight. I urge all members on both sides of the House to keep an ongoing interest in the need to ensure equality, security and certainty for all Australians who are planning for their retirement, no matter who they are.</PARA>

This House, and indeed the parliament of Australia, has a moral obligation to ensure security and certainty for older Australians, for those planning their retirement and for those who have already entered their retirement years. The honourable member was correct in saying that there is an urgent need to address this issue. We are all aware that the Australian population is ageing.

I remind my colleagues on both sides of the House of the debt that this nation owes the Australian men and women who fought with pride under our national flag&mdash;the national flag that the Labor government is seeking to scrap.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I conducted a survey of aged care facilities in the electorate of Fisher, the fastest growing electorate in Australia. Sadly, I was not surprised at the results. Some nursing homes and hostels have acute waiting lists&mdash;that is, urgent cases&mdash;of more than 40 people with many more listed as non-urgent. For instance, the Caboolture RSL War Veterans Home has almost as many people on its waiting list as it has beds. Major problems also exist on Bribie Island, in the city of Caloundra and throughout the rest of the electorate. The Caboolture War Veterans Home has both nursing home and hostel facilities available. About one-third of hostel residents require nursing home care, but they cannot be transferred as there are no beds available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These homes throughout Australia provide quality care for our aged population, but they are fighting an uphill battle against staffing and funding cuts. Nursing home officials express concern about the increasing pressure being placed on the public hospital system as a result of their limited resources. Of course, honourable members would know about the absolutely disgraceful situation existing at the moment where many of our retired people, many of our pensioners, are in public hospital waiting queues. In my area the queues for some elective surgery are as long as four years. I have spoken to specialists who tell me that people are dying on those waiting lists as they wait for so-called elective surgery which in many cases is necessary to correct excruciating medical conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition had as part of its policy prior to the March election last year making private health cover deductible to enable people to take out that cover and reduce public hospital waiting lists. This would have meant that public hospital facilities would have been available to those Australians who needed them, those pensioners who needed them, and people would not have had to wait, as they presently do, for up to four years to get into a public hospital. The government stands condemned for ignoring those retired people, those pensioners, who are presently treated so shabbily. If we do not act now to provide for Australians planning for their retirement, this situation will simply worsen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has repeatedly called for more nursing home beds throughout the country, increased home care resources for our elderly and more community based facilities for our ageing population. Our ageing population has received from the government something entirely different. They have suffered, they continue to suffer, and their plight remains ignored. Those older Australians who planned for their retirement by accumulating shares or investments&mdash;that is, who saved for their future&mdash;have done so only to discover that this Labor government treats unrealised capital gains on shares and investments as income, and therefore many are not entitled to a full, or even a part, pension. </PARA>

I acknowledge that there have been problems with some of the policy agendas that have been put in place, particularly with regard to the managed investments and shares question. There have been some consequences of those actions that have led to calls of unfairness, and that matter needs to be reviewed. The government has responded to that by establishing a comprehensive review into the pensioner income and assets test. We have appointed a firm of consultants, who will be going through and looking at all elements of incomes and assets test and will be consulting widely throughout Australia to get as comprehensive a picture as possible of what should be happening, what the current position is, how it is impacting on people, and how to make the income and assets tests fairer, simpler and more equitable so that all Australians are treated equally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That comprehensive program will run through till about September. It is anticipated that the report will be completed by the end of September. It is at that stage we can start asking the opposition what its position might be in the planning of retirement incomes because apparently, at this stage, it has no policy whatsoever and cannot enlighten this House as to how it would care for older Australians. I believe that that is the crucial question here. We have a government that has made major achievements in planning for older Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a cliche that those who are ignorant of history are destined to repeat it, but it is nevertheless true. I issue a warning to the Australian public and, in particular, to the coalition parties: Senator Evans's threats to change the proportional voting system of the Senate in order to eliminate minority parties have frightening echoes from history. In 1933 the Nazis were frustrated at not having control of the German parliament. They talked other right-wing parties into joining with them to form a majority to expel the communists. The reduction of seats then gave the Nazis a clear majority and, as they say, the rest is history.</PARA></TALK.START>

If Germany had had our single-member electorate system, the Nazis would have won virtually all seats in 1933. </PARA>

It seems that we both want sophisticated intervention into economic activity. Where we might disagree is on the definition of `sophisticated intervention'. Intervention, for example, as practised by the French, may have a role in protecting that part of the economy we call culture.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Friday the premiers, chief ministers and I reached an historic agreement that will open up the non-traded sector of the Australian economy to the same sorts of competitive pressures that our manufacturing, traded services, mining and agricultural industries have been facing for some time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms that will flow from the agreement we reached on competition policy will bring lower prices for consumers, a faster rate of economic growth, more jobs and more exports. Lots of dark rooms of protection and privilege in the economy will be opened up. Just as we have seen competition with telecommunications result in a dramatic reduction in STD charges and dramatically lower domestic airfares, Australians can expect to benefit from cheaper electricity and lower legal fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council of Australian Governments agreed to the principles of competition outlined in the Hilmer report. It agreed to merge the Trade Practices Commission with the Prices Surveillance Authority to form the new Australian Competition Commission. Governments will commence work immediately on the new legislation, which will be considered at the next COAG meeting in August.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is all right about making a statement. We are making a statement now. We are telling people that all of the foreboding and all of the damning of this process, which you said would lead to confrontation and division and nothing, has produced a change of the kind which as a coalition you could not have dreamt of. All of these organisations which have been left for years&mdash;electricity, water, competitive influences in these great government business enterprises&mdash;were there right through the nearly 30 years, or 20-odd years, of coalition government in this country&mdash;30 years bar three years. It was all there waiting for someone else to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me just repeat to the opposition and to the House some of the things which were said about this change in the weekend press. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement on competition policy at yesterday's Council of Australian Governments meeting was a decisive step in securing a more efficient economy. It is a breakthrough for micro-economic reform and deregulation of the economy. Governments, business and ordinary consumers will all gain.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Mr Kitney said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating has pulled off a remarkable victory for the federation. By giving a little to get a lot he has started a process which may transform much of our daily lives. The premiers went to Hobart breathing fire; they left telling a very different story.</PARA>
<PARA>The same paper&mdash;under the heading `States back PM's reform plan'&mdash;refers to it as a `landmark agreement'. Alan Wood in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important step towards an open competitive economy with the endorsement of the principles of competition policy set out in the Hilmer committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal and state governments have taken a major step towards free trade by agreeing to make government enterprise across Australia face competition.</PARA>
<PARA>In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, Mr Burton says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In one day the country's political leaders agreed to new business rules which will do more to integrate Australia's regulated state based industries into one national market than nearly a century of section 92 free trade constitutional cases.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes. It was a very significant meeting and, despite the views of the pundits&mdash;and I might say, of course, the wishes of the federal opposition&mdash;it turned out for the people of Australia to be a very positive one. The Commonwealth now with the states will work on legislation coming up for the August meeting of the Council of Australian Governments to see a national competition commission emerge with the joining of the Trade Practices Commission and the Prices Surveillance Authority, in a change which should have been made 20 years ago. As always in this country, it has been left to a Labor government to turn the place into a proper but sensible and decent market economy.</PARA>

Many in this House welcome official statements which indicate the government's commitment to the achievement of a sovereign, independent Australia. The Prime Minister himself has consistently accused the coalition of tugging the forelock on such matters. In this context, why did the Prime Minister allow the foreign minister to flag the imposition of visa conditions on any proposed visit by Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams which shows duplicity on the issue of violence in Northern Ireland and simply mirrors the confrontationist approach of the British government? Furthermore, how does he respond to those who argue that the government's position on East Timor, like its position on Gerry Adams, shows a distinct lack of independence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen various opposition statements alleging that the recent EPAC report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economic Effects of Microeconomic Reform</EMPHASIS> is an indictment of the government. For instance, the honourable member for Forrest put out a press statement headed `EPAC Report Highlights Government Failure'; the honourable member for Mayo predictably put out a press statement headed `EPAC Report Torpedoes Keating', and so on. Such statements are total nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC report attempts to calculate the macro-economic benefits of further micro-economic reform, that is, the benefits to increased gross domestic product, employment, real wages, per capita incomes and so on. In so doing it notes that Australia's micro-economic reform performance has already produced quite significant economic benefits. For instance, on page vii it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerable progress on microeconomic reform has been made in Australia over the past decade.</PARA>
<PARA>On page xii it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Structural reform has been in progress in Australia since the mid-1980s and, in many instances, reforms have been in advance of those in many other OECD economies. In consequence, Australia is well-placed to take major advantage of Asian dynamism and the onset of broader international economic recovery to enhance real income and job growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the authors of this report think that what has happened to this stage has been good. The report goes on to say that we need to do more. Other countries are doing more, they are getting into this area, we need to do more; we agree absolutely with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is totally wrong to then assert, as the opposition does, that the additional reforms that this report goes on to look at and measure in terms of macro-economic benefits are additional to the government's program. In fact, pretty well all of them are the government's program. What the honourable member for Forrest obviously does not have any understanding about whatever is that this report models the macro-economic effect of implementing the government's micro-economic reform program. It does it sector by sector. If the honourable member bothered to read the report, he would see that that is the case. Let me take him through some of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it talks about in terms of future reduction in tariffs is the government's program for tariff reductions as set out to the year 2000. In the case of shipping, it looks at reform of coastal shipping under the government's program through SIRA, the Shipping Industry Reform Authority. In relation to liner shipping, it looks at the abolition of part X of the Trade Practices Act. That is what Hilmer has reported should be abolished. We have got another report from Brazil which says not to abolish it. The government will consider its decision on that shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stevedoring the report models further gains through the current reform in the sea-land interface; I emphasise the word `current'. It refers to furthering the operations of port authorities; that gets caught up in the Hilmer discussions with the states last Friday that the Prime Minister was just discussing. Then it talks about the further efficiency of the operators which comes from the introduction of enterprise employment which we introduced. We changed the system from what it was for most of the century to a system based on enterprise employment which we have introduced and which drives efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On rail it models the process of putting rail freight on an international best practice productivity level, plus the movement to full cost recovery. That is what the National Rail Corporation is all about. It is set up on that basis. Plus, we have added three-quarters of a billion dollars in infrastructure development to assist it. So those opposite should not tell us that the model in the report is not our reform on rail. On telecommunications the report says that despite important gains to date there is more to come, and it acknowledges that the government's phased increases in competition will achieve major productivity reform. So again it is substantially our program which is talked about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the manufacturing sector, which should have particular relevance to the honourable member for Forrest, the report points out that the major factors driving productivity improvement are tariff reductions, our tariff reductions, plus workplace reform&mdash;which is certainly our program&mdash;plus education and training reform. All of that is in the government's agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On electricity, gas and water the report says that more needs to be done, but it lies mainly with the states. We are driving the states through the COAG meeting on Friday&mdash;getting the states on side with Hilmer, which means that their electricity, gas and water authorities are open to competition and that drives efficiency improvement and increased productivity. The report says that there is nothing more to do on domestic aviation, we have basically done it all. On the CAA, it models the government's program for reform. On international aviation, it says that there may be some further changes that need to be made based on reports a few years old and it acknowledges that the government has made changes since which substantially implement that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that more needs to be done on public administration. We agree with that. It acknowledges that there have been big changes since the 1980s. We agree with that. For instance, we have now introduced agency bargaining, which will have a considerable productivity promotion effect on the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, far from demonstrating the government's failure, if one accepts the author's calculations, this report by EPAC enables us to measure in some way the benefits to flow to the Australian economy from the government's program of micro-economic reform. It shows that over the decade to 2001 we will be looking at a GDP improvement of from 12.7 per cent to 15.4 per cent and above what it would have been without that program&mdash;12 to 15 per cent&mdash;at unemployment reduced to just over five per cent by the year 2000, compared with over seven per cent without that reform program, and at real wages about seven per cent higher than they otherwise would have been. So, far from being a condemnation, this is a very good publication which demonstrates to the Australian people that the government's program of micro-economic reform is very much to their benefit and which gives some basis on which one can absolutely measure that.</PARA>

The Australian vocational certificate system, which the Commonwealth is creating in cooperation with industry and with the support of the states, emphasises flexible delivery and the establishment of a national framework to ensure that qualifications and skills are entirely portable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. But even more important is the need for a training system which can ensure that young people have the flexibility to adapt and to adjust their skills to suit the changing needs of the economy. The labour market lessons of the seventies and eighties are quite clear: the surest way to strangle an economic recovery is through skill shortages. The government is committed to ensuring that the labour force has the skills to adapt to changes in the workplace. That is precisely the reason that the Commonwealth is spending over $1 billion in additional funding on the nation's training systems&mdash;to ensure that the training places which industry will need are available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was for all of these reasons that I was delighted to launch the New South Wales traineeship summit last Friday, along with Labour Council secretary, Mike Easson, industry leaders and state minister Chikarovski. The summit in Sydney confirmed an employer-union commitment to create a base target of 10,000 new jobs for young people in New South Wales this year. But the summit was not just about jobs; it was about the creation of jobs with futures, jobs which are linked to the Commonwealth funded training reform agenda. The New South Wales target of 10,000 jobs plus training will be achieved through increased participation in industries as diverse as clerical, automotive, metals, manufacturing, hospitality, retail and banking.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a landmark decision by Commissioner Smith of the Industrial Relations Commission just two weeks ago. Both groups&mdash;the Commonwealth and the PSU, which were involved&mdash;have agreed that under certain conditions people can work from home as members of the Australian Public Service. I think that is a good decision and it is one that should be laden with some productivity improvements by way of allowing people the flexibility to work out their home arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to outline some boundaries that the commissioner has set around that practice. The key point is that these arrangements are not to be used as a replacement for child care. In other words, there is no intention by the government that a person should work at home as a substitute for our own child-care policies. Nevertheless, it may be to the individuals'&mdash;male or female&mdash;advantage to arrange their work at home such that they can work more readily and make arrangements for their children. Secondly, this is not as of right. This will be judged on a case by case basis so that the individual and the secretary to a department, for instance, need to sit down individually and work through whether or not it is going to suit their practices. Thirdly, no employees can be offered a job at a higher or lower designation so that they can be induced to work at home; that would be improper. Fourthly, these arrangements will only last for 12 months in the initial instance and will, therefore, be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record the fact that we are very positive about these arrangements. I think they are sensible. I think a lot of people will take up home-based work where it is possible for people to work at home&mdash;for instance, if they use a computer a great deal. We have set boundaries around the arrangements. We will look at them in 12 months time.

Is the minister aware that 93,000 Australians are directly employed in the textile, footwear and clothing industries, 12,000 are employed in the banana industry, and 6,000 are employed in the tobacco industry and the downstream cigarette manufacturing industry? Since all these industries are highly labour intensive and of their very nature are not capable of mechanisation, under a regime of absolute free trade they will face competition from offshore corporations in Asia and central America where employees work for around $2 per day. Could the minister, therefore, advise the House whether the government intends that these industries be abolished? If so, what provision has been made for the consequent unemployment, with flow-on, of some 200,000 Australians or, alternatively, is the government contemplating that our Australian workers will work for the same wage levels as those paid by our overseas competitors?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, I want to say that I am particularly concerned that hundreds of Australian ex-servicemen, who served in the Korean theatre of war, have received no recognition from the Department of Defence. A committee has been appointed to review Defence awards. I encourage the government, when the committee's report is received, to make provision for acknowledging the service of these men.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of my constituents served on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shoalhaven</EMPHASIS> during the Korean conflict in 1954-55 on 21-day patrols on five separate occasions off the west coast of Korea. This was during the Armistice period, was classed as active duty and was recognised by the RSL. But the Department of Defence never issued a service or defence medal. I believe that recognition is deserved. It is unfair that ex-servicemen are not recognised, and I ask the government to take action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar way, I draw attention to the situation regarding Australian merchant mariners who served in World War II. I note that on 18 November last year this House considered a motion, which states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) war-time mariners should be given access to the same benefits under the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 as those who served in the armed forces;</PARA>
<PARA>I have taken this matter up with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) who advised me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 August 1993 I announced that there would be an independent review of the veterans compensation pensions system. I asked for benefits for Australian mariners to be included in the terms of reference of the review. </PARA>
<PARA>That review committee is due to report in March this year. I urge the government to take action, once that report is received, to extend benefits to Australian merchant mariners. I also note that the minister has said that this `would have to be considered in a budgetary context with regard to other priorities, commitments and available funds'. I hope that available funds will be found to provide justice for merchant mariners who served Australia during World War II. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the Bayldon community centre in my electorate of Cowper which is providing a valuable service to the community. It has been forced to close or at least withdraw some of its valuable services because of lack of funding. It was opened two years ago under the wing of the Coffs Harbour neighbourhood centre and has been serving the suburbs of Bayldon and Toormina and also includes a department of housing estate and an imminent new subdivision to cope with 4,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The services provided have given help on legal, accountancy, tax matters, low cost typing, photocopying, assistance with job applications and emergency help and referrals&mdash;all of which are extremely valuable services for people who need help. During the past 12 months 5,000 people have been helped by this particular community's service. Its funding, which originally was under DEET's jobskills program&mdash;the jobs eligibility program&mdash;will expire at the end of this month; in other words, today. The recession funds, which came through the Coffs Harbour centre, were funded by the department of community services, but now there are no more funds. I believe it is essential that this service is able to continue and provide services for all those who are so desperately in need of help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still concerned about the government's treatment of shares and the assets and income tests of pensioners, which I believe to be unfair and unjust and which involve a great deal of inequity. I acknowledge that the review of income and assets tests for social security pensioners, service pensioners and other retirees is under way at present. I encourage any member of the Australian public who is concerned about these assets and income tests to make a submission to that inquiry. Those submissions should be addressed to the Manager, Income and Assets Test Review Secretariat, Department of Social Security, PO Box 7788, Canberra Mail Centre, 2610. It is a vital question which is of importance to a great many elderly Australian people. I hope they make submissions and get the right answers coming through to improve their lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very concerned about youth homelessness, in which there has been an enormous growth in five years. In June 1987, 942 had registered for youth homeless assistance. In 1993, just five years later, it had leapt to 10,485. That figure must be of concern to every member of this parliament and to all Australians. In some cases, I have no doubt that the Department of Social Security has actively encouraged young people to leave home. We have heard stories of young people saying, `I've had a row with mum' and the departmental officer saying, `Here's the homeless youth allowance form'. This has happened in my electorate in the last two weeks, and I do not think it is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth homeless allowance is a valuable safety net and, where there is abuse of children&mdash;whether it is sexual, physical, mental or emotional&mdash;it is essential that that net is there. How widespread the encouragement from departmental officers is needs to be established and to what extent it acts as a deterrent to reconciliation of the child with the family. Therefore, like my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I am particularly pleased that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is conducting an inquiry. I encourage people with experience or knowledge of incidents where the Department of Social Security's handling has not been as good as it should be to make submissions to the committee at Parliament House, Canberra. The closing date for those submissions is 15 March, so there is not a great deal of time left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the question of families within Australia, particularly within my electorate, I am concerned about the very pressing need for an adequate and permanent Family Court counselling service in the Coffs Harbour region. There is much social dislocation, a very low average income, and the closest Family Court counselling service is 3 1/2 hours away by public transport. Circuit counselling can only do court ordered counselling, and is unable to deal with the vast numbers of voluntary referrals. Sometimes there is a six-week delay between circuits and, therefore, there can be a delay of months before counselling is available for someone who needs it. Disputes escalate which, with the aid of counselling, could perhaps be solved. They end up becoming fully fledged trials. This is a waste of resources. It is unnecessarily stressful for the children, let alone for the husband and wife who are involved in the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early crisis intervention by a counselling service can actively reduce the number of marriages which are breaking up. The area is now servicing 200,000 people and funds are desperately needed for permanent counselling for the Family Law Court. Almost all custody and access trials have proceeded past three years. Many could be avoided if skilled counselling were available. Early resolution could result in enormous savings and in less heartbreak. Above all, this would be much better for children. I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) for more funding to be provided to establish a Coffs Harbour subregistry and for additional resources for counselling, as recommended by the Senate inquiry into certain aspects of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to speak about the impact of fringe benefits tax on the families of clergy right around Australia. Many families of the clergy in my electorate have come to see me. They are losing the family allowance supplement because of the value of free housing provided by the church. The Anglican Diocese of Grafton has provided me with a significant amount of information, but it affects clergy of other denominations too. I am concerned that the deeming provisions on the value of housing have caused significant hardship to the clergy and their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Housing is a major benefit and a condition of employment for members of the clergy. They are provided rent-free accommodation. That accommodation is not used just for the family&mdash;it is used as an office for meetings, for counselling and for other parish related functions. It is certainly not just a family house. Clergy stipends are undoubtedly low, particularly when compared with the salary levels of other professionals. The clergy depend on the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. The wife of one clergyman wrote to me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Incomes of clergymen are not commensurate with other professionals . . . Their families appreciate and need the FAS to make ends meet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The house we live in is totally paid for and owned by the parish . . . On the other hand we will never be able to buy a house as we do not have the funds to do so. We have $1600 in a special account for emergencies&mdash;eg. operation for child next year, and that is a sum total of our savings. This will never get us a deposit let alone pay off a home.</PARA>
<PARA>I note, too, that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) has advised that the department will be monitoring the effects of the inclusion of the value of employer provided benefits, and this needs to be done. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Premier of Victoria and his tamed and trained cabinet are steadily turning Victoria into the Queensland of Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, a state of looking after your mates, corruption and intimidation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we start at the top and look at the members of the Premier's own government, we find that none of them can speak to certain television programs. None of them can speak on certain programs on the radio or to the newspapers. This muzzling of his own government members has spread throughout the Public Service. No public servant can speak freely. Teachers are intimidated. Public servants in unions are also affected. This rule by fear is starting to permeate the whole of the work force and this is just what the Liberals want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After they have muzzled the Public Service, they next start on the judiciary and those in a position where they can assist the disadvantaged. Take, for example, the attack on the public prosecutor in Victoria&mdash;someone who has had the guts to take on the Police Association, John Elliott and the like. Then there is the sacking of the Equal Opportunity Commissioner, a person who fought for the disadvantaged, for migrants and for the mentally disabled. The people she protected will be left at the mercy of the members of the Kennett government, and we know what a merciful lot they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out briefly how the Liberal government of Victoria has started to intimidate from the top the people of Victoria.

<PARA>That shows the degree of meanness of the Liberals and it is being imposed on many groups like this all over Victoria. The Liberals have cut $4,000 from this group, money that these people use to come together to discuss their problems, money that was used for self-help. It would enable these people to get together once a month to compare notes and to talk about their problems. The Victorian Liberal government is a truly mean government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only have the Liberals savaged the infrastructure put in place to assist those in need but also they will have a go at anyone who does not subscribe to their basic theories of putting profits before people or simply, `Up you, Jack, I'm all right'. I do not believe that what they are practising is acceptable. It is un-Australian. If they want to preach the policies of greed, they should be up-front about it instead of hiding behind a mask of social conscience. Their meanness knows no bounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers who were recently devastated by floods have got nothing. They have had their schools closed, their trains taken and their councils closed. Pensioners have had their free travel during Seniors Week removed. How could anyone do that? Jeffrey Kennett did it. Pensioners have also had a $100 poll tax enforced. Electricity, gas, rates, registration, insurance, et cetera have all been dramatically increased by the Kennett Liberal government. It has cruelly not used Commonwealth funding worth $6.1 million. That money is sitting unused. Over 6,400 Victorians could miss out on vital hospital treatment, many elderly with painful complaints like needing hip replacements. They are suffering while the Kennett Liberal government tries to force more money from the Commonwealth. It is bargaining with the pain and suffering of the people of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria's public transport system is going downhill at an alarming rate. A recent report said that in 1993 tram use had declined by nine per cent; public transport buses, six per cent; and trains, nine per cent. This is just what the Liberals want. The Liberal government has done this by subsidising private bus operators, increasing public transport fares, altering timetables and frequencies of trains. It wants to hand it all over to the private bus operators who openly supported its election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Kids have had their schools closed. Kindergarten fees have increased by 200 per cent. Class sizes have increased. There have been no teachers. Parents have had to foot the bill for increased travel costs. The Kennett government has also cut out remedial teachers so that kids with learning difficulties will be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives. Who else could these Liberals attack? The rich? No way. The poor? Yes. They have done so through public utility charges. The sick? Yes. The injured? Yes. The workers? Yes. What is left&mdash;animals? Surely they would not, would they?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprise, surprise, the Kennett Liberal government has imposed upon animals its right wing economic rationalism. It has cut funding to the RSPCA. How mean can you get? An organisation devoted to treating animals in a humane way has had its funding cut by 50 per cent. This means that animals which have been mistreated will not be able to be nursed back to health because of Kennett's cuts. Putting to a stop the cruel uses of animals will be curtailed and the collection of thousands of dumped animals will not be carried out. To attack people is one thing but to impose this type of action on animals is unbelievable. My state is run by a government of arrogance. Take, for example, this quote:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The area of my grievance is covered by a speech I made the other day when I spoke on a number of issues relating to the ALP and to Carmen Lawrence, the nominee of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the Fremantle by-election. During that speech, I claimed that Carmen Lawrence must accept direct responsibility for the suicide of a lawyer known as Penny Easton. I have been called upon to substantiate my claim. Therefore, I provide the House with the following information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Penny Easton suicided after and as the result of the tabling of a petition in the WA Legislative Council by a close Lawrence associate, John Halden. The petition was said to be lodged on behalf of Brian, the divorced husband of Penny Easton, claiming Penny Easton and her sister Margaret McAulay had committed perjury in the Family Court by claiming that Brian Easton had told them he was to receive a secret government payback for achieving major Public Service staff reductions during his term as Public Service Commissioner. At the time, the sisters were unable to identify the source of this funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Halden made this attack for two reasons. Firstly, Margaret McAulay, who was then the solicitor appointed by the Lawrence government to represent the interests of a group of women defrauded by the now gaoled Robyn Greenberg, had just, contrary to Lawrence's expectations, informed Lawrence as Premier that she had established sufficient evidence to prove that a government agency, the Women's Information Referral Centre, otherwise known as WIRE, was sufficiently responsible for the financial losses of her clients, who had invested with Robyn Greenberg after WIRE referrals, and that, consequently, the government should pay them compensation&mdash;something that has consequently been done by the Court government. Lawrence had consistently denied to the WA parliament that she even knew Greenberg existed until confronted with a copy of a letter she had written to Greenberg, and certainly did not want this advice, and had expected McAulay to advise her clients they had no case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer here to direct interviews. Penny Easton was to be attacked in an attempt to implicate the Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court, because she&mdash;Penny Easton&mdash;had asked him for information and so accused Court of being the subject of a subsequent police investigation because Carmen Lawrence was under a police inquiry into the unreturned $5,000 of government money that she had received two years before&mdash;in other words, to create a smokescreen. Not only did Lawrence authorise Halden's attack on the two sisters; she was aware that the women's claim was correct and, as Premier, she had been party to a secret arrangement to pay Brian Easton the $200,000 kickback of which he had boasted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year of Easton's five-year contract as Public Service Commissioner, he was surprisingly moved from that position to the Aboriginal Planning Authority, where he immediately set about putting a proposal&mdash;which</PARA>
<PARA>of course went through the chairman&mdash;to Carmen Lawrence, as Premier and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, for a government grant of $614,640 to form the Aboriginal Houses Development Association, AHDA. Surprise, surprise, Easton was to become the project manager, with a two-year contract of $89,000 per annum and $7,900 in expenses&mdash;to be paid from this special government grant. That is a total of approximately $194,000&mdash;or the $200,000 kickback his wife had claimed he was to receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project was personally approved on 14 June 1990 under the signature of Carmen Lawrence as Premier and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Easton became a joke amongst the Aboriginal people who formed the board of the AHDA, where it was clear he had no real role. They called him the silver fox. They eventually terminated his appointment in October 1991&mdash;but, I understand, at considerable cost; possibly $120,000. Easton apparently was also in receipt of his salary as Public Service Commissioner until the conclusion of his five-year contract in June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence approved the proposal from Easton, and her signature appeared immediately below the typed words `Contact Officer: Brian Easton'. The page also contained some handwritten notes which confirm her clear knowledge of the arrangement. It was not just a casual signature that a premier might provide in going through a stack of documents as a daily duty; there was a reference that clearly showed that her staffers wanted a certain publicity to be given to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So when Carmen Lawrence authorised Halden to do a hatchet job on the two sisters, purely for political purposes, and accused them of perjury, she actually knew they were telling the truth. She had also been party to an outrageous scam to waste $614,000 of taxpayers' dollars to hide a kickback of approximately $200,000 to Brian Easton for services rendered in taking the heat off the Labor government during the activities of the Public Service razor gang, which drastically  reduced Public Service numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This person, who was not a public servant, was put into that job. There was huge outrage. Easton had a very bad reputation. He had been head of Exim&mdash;one of the organisations that because of public demand had to be collapsed when Burke left&mdash;and he had managed to be thrown out. He was transferred into the job of Public Service Commissioner and given the task&mdash;by a Labor government&mdash;of getting rid of as many public servants as he could. He did the job deliberately and well, and the deal that he personally boasted of was, `I'm gonna get a big sling'. He did it in front of his wife and her sister. When the marriage broke down, they wanted to know where the money was. Of course, he said they had perjured themselves in making that claim. A member of the Labor government at the time stood up in the parliament and dragged the reputations of those two women into the mud to punish Margaret McAulay. She was appointed as a government solicitor; she did her job properly on behalf of her clients; and, of course, she was dealt with too. That is her personal view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of my speech I will seek leave to table a copy of the letter of approval, as signed by Carmen Lawrence, and a copy of the budget for the first two years of AHDA, which clearly shows Easton's salary and expenses. It further shows that he and one other non-working person were to receive approximately half of the $614,000 of government money which everyone was being told was put there to assist the Aboriginal people in putting together a housing cooperative. Furthermore, the AHDA project has been the subject of audit criticism, with hundreds of thousands of dollars not properly accounted for. We have no idea how much of that Mr Easton might have received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here are the unassailable facts. Carmen Lawrence had good reason to punish Margaret McAulay for doing her job with integrity and failing to give the government an excuse to walk away from the highly embarrassing WIRE-Greenberg issue. I remind the House that this woman, who had a rotten record prior to this matter, was in the same corridor as this WIRE group. Women, having just had divorces and things of that nature, and getting property settlements, were being sent down to this crook by this women's referral centre to invest their money. Of course, they all lost it. Carmen Lawrence fought, scratched and battled not to refund that money, knowing full well the involvement of her own government agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carmen Lawrence was facing severe embarrassment over travelling money that she had failed to repay, notwithstanding that two tax returns had gone in. Penny Easton, the lady who suicided, provided a tenuous link to implicate the Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court. I stress that the link was tenuous. Penny Easton had gone to Richard Court because he had made some critical speeches of some of the other golden handshakes that Easton had received. She simply asked him whether he knew anything about this extra money. He replied, `You would have to read the public record'. Consequently, Easton demanded a police inquiry. So there was this tenuous link to implicate the Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lawrence therefore arranged for Halden to table a petition accusing these two women of perjury, knowing that  there was substantial truth in their claim because she had actually approved of the process by which Brian Easton was to receive the $200,000 kickback of which the sisters said he had boasted. The issue of the process used to hide this kickback, in which Carmen Lawrence as Premier clearly was knowingly involved, is one for the state parliament. But I submit that this information is clear evidence to support the claim that Carmen Lawrence, in the naked pursuit of political gain, knowingly approved false allegations against a woman who subsequently and consequently took her life. I therefore repeat my claim: Carmen Lawrence has blood on her hands. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance today is about the way that the media trivialises women in politics. I suppose that after hearing the honourable member for O'Connor I really cannot blame the media at times. Such trivialisation is particularly evident to anyone who has been reading the papers recently following the announcement of ex-senator Bronwyn Bishop that she will contest a lower house seat and, more so, since the Western Australian opposition leader and former Western Australian Premier Dr Carmen Lawrence made an announcement about her intention to enter federal politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go any further, it is pertinent that I place on the record my sincere regret at what I believe has been a trial by the media regarding the work of the ex-Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly). I condemn the opposition for what has happened. I want to be one of the first to say that I particularly enjoyed working with the minister. I have always admired her as a person of character and strong conviction. She is a person who got on with the job that was asked of her, and she did it to the best of her ability. On behalf of many people in the electorates at large across Australia, I particularly appreciate the wonderful sporting grants that have helped in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to how I believe the media has trivialised women politicians at times. My main objections have related to comparisons of women politicians and their attributes and suggestions that they pit woman against woman rather than that they are political opponents. Members of the media have continually used trite headlines to describe women politicians and their actions. We have continually read about how women overlook their vital and worthwhile roles in so many spheres. It all comes from the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all read about the prediction that the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) would set the world on fire when he entered this parliament. The question to ask is: where is he now? The same media members glorified speculative investors such as Bond and Skase. In other words, at times the media overlooks substance for a bit of flim-flam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer particularly to the headlines that we have all seen when we have read the papers. Recently, some of those headlines have included `Ladies in waiting' to describe Carmen Lawrence and Bronwyn Bishop, and `Lawrence lured from the west by PM', as though someone of Dr Lawrence's capabilities and calibre cannot even make up her own mind. Another headline read `Lawrence puts home on market'. How banal! Do any members of the opposition get the same types of headlines? One of the worst headlines read `Will the real Lawrence please stand up?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One description of Bronwyn Bishop was `The most dreadful weapon known to male politics'. That does not even bear comment, yet it was a headline in one of our national newspapers. But the very worst headline was `Carmen's love child', which scored a cover page billing on a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Idea</EMPHASIS>. It was outrageous.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lawrence has very impressive credentials. Her academic record and work experience would run rings around the average Australian. Yet this was how the media portrayed her. Even sections of the media acknowledge their own fixations with comparing Carmen Lawrence and Bronwyn Bishop. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial of 5 February this year stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in Australia's political system there continues to be a fascination with this still peculiar creature&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>its words, not mine&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the female politician.</PARA>
<PARA>That editorial went on to question whether the media would have bothered to compare Dr Lawrence and ex-senator Bishop had they been the popular Western Australian cricketer Geoff Marsh and the New South Wales Liberal Party President, Peter King, respectively. That same editorial also notes that the media did not bother to compare the two recently retired politicians, John Dawkins and Jim Carlton. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some substance, why does the media not ask Dr Lawrence serious questions, such as her plans in the federal arena? Perhaps some serious comments could be sought on federal issues and policies and how she might implement ideas from the state sphere in the federal parliament. The same questions could perhaps also be asked of ex-Senator Bishop. Perhaps there could then be less media concentration on the negative attributes of these people and more focus on the positive contributions that they could make to this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part of my grievance today, I would also like to quote&mdash;it really bears out what I am saying&mdash;the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) entitled `Women, power and the 21st century'. In a conference last year, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equal representation of women and men strengthens the legitimacy of our decision making process. More than that, it strengthens our capacity to make the right decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need Joan Kirner and Carmen Lawrence&mdash;and many more like them&mdash;in the national parliament. We need them in the debates on economic and social policy, on unemployment, the workplace, trade, foreign affairs, arts, Mabo.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to say that the managing director of ANOP Research Services and former ALP pollster, Rod Cameron, said recently:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A woman with experience in bringing up a family is now worth an extra percentage point on polling day compared with a male candidate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How true that is. That is because voters continue to recognise that women's experience in so many spheres ensures that they are multiskilled and that they are certainly able to tackle problems from a very wide range of perspectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to see a recent poll survey from the Office of the Status of Women entitled `Juggling time'. It shows that, on average, women, whether they be in the paid work force or not, do over 36 hours a week of unpaid work. It is fairly well acknowledged that if people who perform unpaid work&mdash;traditionally women&mdash;withdrew their labour, our so-called capitalist system would collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are moving into small business and are being very successful. One important study noted that, if current trends continue, by the mid-1990s women will outnumber males as both proprietors and employers in small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are 53 per cent of voters, but make up only 14.5 per cent of the members of Australian parliaments. At the Commonwealth level, women make up only 8.8 per cent of members of the House of Representatives and over 21 per cent of the Senate. One would think that, even with those figures, the media would be more supportive of the role of women and women in politics. It might then encourage more women to participate rather than be deterred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time I have left, I would like to quote some figures. They show that women own or control substantial shareholdings. About 43 per cent of private shareholders and at least 50 per cent of beneficiaries of institutional funds are women. But only around three per cent of members of company boards are women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research by Media Insight indicates that women in Australia now control an annual expenditure of $90.2 billion in household outlays. People may be also interested to know that one of the most successful publications of the Office of the Status of Women is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Media complaints</EMPHASIS> brochure. With little publicity, over 56,000 copies have been requested from the office over the last two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are now abandoning newspapers, where they are virtually invisible, and are shifting to magazines, despite the tight economy. The gross annual circulation of the major women's magazines grew by 10 per cent between 1987 and 1992. The First Assistant Secretary of the Office of the Status of Women, Ann Sherry, has argued that women must now be heads of state. Why not? Ms Sherry has also suggested that Australia's first president should be installed by the year 2000 and should be female. `Why not, again?', says Ms Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women are no longer rare in political life or, as many honourable members will know, as heads of major organisations and lobbyists.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my speech in the grievance debate today to the issue of the Federal Airports Corporation and, in particular, the implementation in 1988 of control of the nation's airports by the Federal Airports Corporation. The FAC was directed to introduce business management practices aimed at making each airport profitable in a self-sufficient manner. To that end, I have a number of concerns not only about Moorabbin airport in my electorate but also about a number of others around the country. Mr David Stack, the Moorabbin airport manager, has said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Airports are more than just a centre for aircraft . . . They are people places and they provide hundreds of jobs and host scores of businesses, many not directly related to aviation.</PARA>
<PARA>I have no problems with his overall aims for the development of the airport, but I am concerned at some of the commercial developments that are being established at airports such as Moorabbin. I am particularly concerned about the way in which a development&mdash;called a leisure park but it really is a large market&mdash;is being established at that airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be some 650 stalls at this market site. The total area of the site at the airport will be 27 acres. It will have a car park for some 2,400 cars. Three acres of buildings will accommodate 650 stallholders. According to the brochure put out by Fairways Leisure Market&mdash;the company which has actually signed the lease, subject to some final arrangements with the airport&mdash;one stall will cost $100 per week; two stalls, $85 a week; and, if people take four or more stalls, $75 per week per stall. The brochure indicates that the market will be open for some four days a week at this stage. The specifics of that are not clear because it is something that will be done on an internal basis between the airport management and the people who are signing the lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that basis, one needs only to look at the rental costs of a shop in the shopping centres and the access to traffic, particularly in some of the smaller shopping centres, to realise that many of the people who operate these stalls will take business away from the smaller shopping centres in the community. All of the chambers of commerce in the region, including the Cheltenham, Mentone, Mordialloc, Parkdale and south-eastern chambers of commerce, have indicated strong opposition. I guess what is concerning them the most is that not only will there be this development but also there is a substantial development proposed at the Southland shopping centre by Westfield. In fact, it is envisaging a $216 million expansion. Westfield, of course, is also upset. Part of the reason for it being upset, as one of the executives said, is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's hardly a level playing field when we go through complicated legal zoning procedures costing $3 million over the past three years and the Federal Airports Corporation can create a market with a simple announcement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the years of rezoning and legal submissions we have made through the proper channels have been blown out of the water.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a valid comment made by Westfield. It has had to go through rigorous planning procedures to get its approval for the shopping centre. It has had the opportunity of having the local municipality assessing the project in the planning processes. Westfield says that these approvals have cost it some $3 million&mdash;something that will not be a cost for the development of the site at the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see that the Victorian Minister for Planning, Mr Rob Maclellan, has threatened to cut road services to the Moorabbin airport if the airport proceeds to hold markets on the site. Mr Maclellan attacked the Federal Airports Corporation in state parliament this month for allowing the airport to build the $3.5 million leisure market without consideration for nearby commercial centres. He acknowledged that his threat was desperate but said it was unfair that airports could use their land for other purposes without having to apply for proper planning permits. Mr Maclellan said that the federal government should force the Federal Airports Corporation to adhere to state planning regulations when it developed some other use for its land. He said the FAC proposal at Moorabbin would compete with other commercial centres that had been forced to have the merits of their proposals judged by the full participatory planning system in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to look in detail at the Moorabbin Council's comments in this area. After all, Moorabbin Council is the local government authority responsible for the airport. Moorabbin Council has indicated when writing about this issue that this is not only a problem for it but also a problem for the Australian Mayoral Aviation Council, of which the council is a member. Moorabbin Council indicates that at most of the annual conferences and meetings of the AMAC the issue of the Federal Airports Corporation and the shield of the Crown with respect to developments of this nature is discussed. It appears on their terms that there is little that council can do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fascinating that there are no appeal mechanisms available to the local council for developments that will affect quite substantially some of the commercial operators and small businesses in the area, yet in reverse the FAC is quite happy to use the appeal process. The council actually highlights the fact that discussions with FAC management clearly indicate that the FAC will not submit for council planning or building approval, but at the same time it notes that the FAC has participated at length in appeals concerning land usage in areas in the vicinity of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the FAC not submitting to the planning processes, the council indicates that it, the council, has an inability to participate actively in the process of the development affecting the businesses in its local community and to assess the development in the context of its commercial areas and the level of floor space proposed at the regional level and its impact on the locality. The council also says that the issue of extended trading hours and its impact from both the social and economic perspective of the community is affected, that it has an inability to ensure the design of the proposal is compatible with the area and&mdash;I guess one of the major concerns&mdash;that the proposal is not being tested in a public forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me that here we have traders in the community, local government and state ministers all concerned about the ability of the FAC to go ahead with these types of proposals regardless of approval. I believe that this government needs to look closely at this issue. I understand the intent of making airports self-funding and self-sufficient. I have no problems with that issue at all. But when we start allowing airports to establish these types of developments without the planning approval of the local authority, without the costs of planning that are placed on other businesses and without the requirements for trading hours that are placed on other businesses, recognising that they are not contributing to the rating base within that community, I think the process is grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not questioning what the airport manager is doing. He is working within the guidelines that are available to him. In fact, he is working within those to the letter of the law. When commercial and profitable operations are being put on to airport sites where the controls within the local community and other authorities are bypassed, the process that is being operated by the FAC needs to be strongly questioned. The government should take action to ensure that the planning approvals requested by these authorities to enable them to be assessed on a merits basis are actually provided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My grievance today concerns the 400,000 unemployed who are under the age of 30 years and the 850,000 children who live in unemployed households. The 400,000 unemployed under the age of 30 represent 40 per cent of the unemployed in Australia. The 850,000 children who live in unemployed households represent 25 per cent of all children. Yet, faced with these stark figures, neo-classical economists continue to put forward arguments for the policy settings of the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January this year, the ANZ job vacancies totalled only 17,000 for a million unemployed. Although many economists acknowledge unemployment, they seldom suggest where jobs can be created. Neo-classical economists seem to believe that society should serve the economy rather than the reverse. They seem obsessed with monetarists concepts and dismiss numerous policies such as reduction in work time, the potential of labour-intensive environmental employment in renewable energy or recycling in waste management. They ignore employment opportunities in public infrastructure, particularly in public transport. They ignore employment opportunities in the service sector, particular in education and health. They ignore the social costs of unemployment, the increase in crime and suicide. They never mention an inefficient economy with high unemployment. They never refer to occupational health and safety. They ignore lost productivity caused by fatigue and boredom. They ignore increased compensation claims and redundancy payouts and they ignore taxation reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one of problems in their argument is that they only consider the impact of government policy on employers. They seem to ignore the economic consequences of having more people employed, which would mean some of the unemployed becoming wage earners instead of welfare recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that support and prevention are the key to investment in social infrastructure. This is particularly true when policy options are considered for abused children, the mentally ill and the frail aged. Full employment is not about just including the unemployed; it is about sharing the future. Keynes showed that chronic and endemic unemployment could remain in equilibrium in the absence of government intervention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contemporary, natural rate economic theorists seem to prefer the constant pull of unemployment. They have a propensity to hide behind mystifications such as the non-accelerating rate of unemployment, that is, keeping inflation down justifies the unemployment rate. These same neo-classical economists were often scathing in their criticisms of labour market programs. Australia now has more program places than it did in the mid-1980s, which are at a lower cost and are better directed to long-term unemployed. However, in acknowledging that fact, it should also be said that in 1992 two-thirds of the long-term unemployed received no special assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the green paper on unemployment has pointed out, there is a need for boldness in trying new approaches to labour market programs. Labour market programs play a critical role in keeping unemployed people attached to the work force. However, unless certain basic skill requirements are met&mdash;literacy, numeracy, communication and social skills&mdash;meaningful training to improve job prospects is expensive and will be fraught with failure. Labour market programs cannot make up for deficiencies in general education. Hence the link for a skilled worker to the preparation of the work force is in fact education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the beginning of this speech that 400,000 of Australia's unemployed are under 30 years of age. They attended primary school in the 1970s. It is more than interesting to note that in the early 1970s many educationalists in this country were alarmed that up to 10 per cent of children in primary schools lacked basic skills in numeracy and literacy and were calling for urgent additional resources to be allocated to primary schools. Their pleas were largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, several studies in Australia indicated that that figure could be as high as 20 per cent and that up to 25 per cent of children leaving primary school do so with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills. In 10 years time that group will enter the work force and the implications will be in fact horrendous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While federal attention during the last 10 years has focused on higher education, secondary retention rates and lately vocational training, little, if any, attention is paid to the foundation years of schooling, which are predominantly the responsibility of state governments. State governments by their inaction on primary education are putting the future of this nation at risk. The skill base of the Australian work force relies heavily on the quality of Australian schooling. A longitudinal study by the Inner London Education Authority in 1986 strongly suggested that successful schooling for children between the ages of 7 and 11 is the most significant determinant of future success and is more important than gender or socioeconomic background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence that the schooling system is failing to meet the needs of young people. Nowhere is that more evident than in our primary schools. It is a pointless exercise just to blame teachers. They simply do not have the resources available to do what they know can and ought to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Too many children leave primary school unprepared and face often a purely academic curriculum in secondary school, which is not appropriate for the diverse mixture of abilities and interests. Many of these younger people then drop out of school into unemployment and long-term disadvantage. However, I make the point that I made earlier: it is cheaper and more effective to prevent educational problems and subsequent problems with young children than it is to cure those problems when the child is a young man or a young woman. It seems to me that 15- to 19-year-olds should not be in the labour force other than in part-time work unless they are in a training employment scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The green paper on unemployment basically ignores schooling. It also says that a major expansion of post-compulsory education and training would be at a considerable cost and considers that the provision of jobs is a higher immediate priority. But it ignores schemes where jobs could in fact be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no single solution to unemployment. Economic growth by itself will not solve the problem and, if there is little change to the school system, then continued large numbers of unprepared young people will feed into a very unsympathetic labour market. One million adult Australians, including 650,000 of English-speaking background, have difficulty in relatively everyday reading and writing tasks. Adults with difficulties in everyday reading and writing tasks were once children with everyday reading and writing difficulties. If we were driving along in our motor vehicle and the oil light came on, we would not wait until the engine seized to replenish the oil. That is commonsense. So it is with literacy problems, we can prevent problems cheaply. It is much harder and more expensive to cure literacy, numeracy and social problems of adolescents and young adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unemployment debate in this nation will not be complete unless a wide array of solutions is canvassed. There will be little sustained change to unemployment levels if there is no change to our school system. There will be little sustained change to unemployment if there is no serious debate on the potential for jobs in environmental management and technology. Perhaps we need to take heed of the Japanese. They are spending $1 billion a year to achieve world leadership in environmental management and technology by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be little sustained change in unemployment if there is no serious debate on the reduction of working hours and job sharing. There will be little sustained change to unemployment if public infrastructure, particularly public transport, falls off the national agenda. There will be little sustained change if there is no further taxation reform. There will be little sustained change if we do not seriously consider re-engineering social security and employment benefits from the current passive mode to a more active one. There will be little change if we continue to allow neo-classical economists to dominate the unemployment debate. They appear to have a wanton disregard for the unemployed, with their obsessiveness in maintaining the status quo of policy settings of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia led the world in the introduction of social benefits and it can lead the developed world in breaking the cycle of unemployment. The economic orthodoxies of the past 10 years have had both positive and negative effects. Australia is much more competitive, that is acknowledged. But those same economic orthodoxies have led to significant job losses. Economic orthodoxies by themselves will not solve the unemployment problem; single solutions will not solve the unemployment problem. However, an array of solutions tempered with a degree of federal government intervention can and must solve the problem of unemployment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to grieve about the dismissal of two women from the staff of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I refer to Ms Bridget Mullin and Ms Gail Gray, who had previously served on the staff of the Lodge for some time and who were advised on 3 October 1993 that they should not report to work. On 5 October, the housekeepers' contracts were terminated. No notice period was given and they were effectively locked out. This matter subsequently received considerable media attention and was also referred to the Ombudsman by the legal representative of these two women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that on 19 January 1994 the Ombudsman said that she would investigate statements made about the sackings at the November estimates, but not the circumstances of dismissal. On 4 February 1994, the Ombudsman advised that she was reconsidering her decision not to investigate circumstances surrounding the termination of the housekeepers. It is significant that this whole matter is, to this day, still surrounded in some controversy and considerable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point, which this parliament must always be aware of, is that we are essentially here to represent all citizens, especially the underdogs. In this case, these two housekeepers continue to be extremely distressed because the decision of the Ombudsman effectively means that their complaints will not be investigated. These two women can best be described as low income earners and at present have no income at all. They are unemployed and they may remain unemployable. Why? Because over their names now hangs the stench of the allegations made in the media and Senate estimates committees, all of which have not been tested and about which public servants have not had the opportunity to explain the facts; nor have these two women been given the opportunity to express their points of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most extraordinary thing I find in all of this is that the Ombudsman claimed that she cannot carry through a further investigation because this involves a ministerial decision. Yet I noticed in her annual report that the point is made very clearly that she claims the right to investigate `pre-employment and post-employment matters'. She also goes on to mention `access and equity as a high priority' as part of her objectives. Certainly she should be `accessible to those who need us most', as she claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The `promotion of the office's services to low income and disadvantaged groups', as stated in her 1993 annual report, is part of the objective of the Ombudsman's office&mdash;one would have to say that in both these cases that has certainly not been met. Therefore, the question that has to be referred to this parliament is: what can be done to support Ms Mullin and Ms Gray in their case against what they claim to be wrongful dismissal? Ultimately, responsibility must reside with the person who employed them, which in this case is the Prime Minister, because they were employees of the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's rights in terms of the administration of his staff were transferred to officers of the Prime Minister's department. It is claimed by the Ombudsman that, because of that transfer of responsibility, that is therefore seen as a ministerial decision. It is only fair to say that even the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), when this matter was given an airing at the Senate estimates, made it quite clear that he could not understand how that formula could possibly be applied in this case. It is also worth noting that under section 5(3) of the Ombudsman Act it is patently obvious that staff would be subject to scrutiny by the Ombudsman if she so wished. In this case, however, she has chosen not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at the Ombudsman's reversal of her decision to investigate these statements made about the housekeepers' dismissal for the following reasons. Firstly, the decision was advised the same day as Senate Estimates Committee E was inquiring into the manner of the housekeepers' dismissal and also on the same day as the Prime Minister went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Midday Show</EMPHASIS> to say that it was an issue between the women and the department&mdash;not, presumably, between him and his employees. Secondly, Estimates Committee E met at 4.32 p.m. on 22 February. Senator Evans and Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet officials at that hearing were aware of the Ombudsman's decision not to investigate the statements made about the housekeepers at a previous estimates committee hearing. Yet the Ombudsman did not notify the housekeepers' lawyer of her decision until 4.40 p.m. the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet advised the Ombudsman of its concerns about investigating statements made under privilege&mdash;advice the Ombudsman obviously heeded in reversing her original decision to investigate the statements made about the housekeepers. Perhaps one of the questions which has not been answered is: did she take advice from the Attorney-General? Did she only take advice from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet? As I pointed out, section 5(3) of her own act would on the face of it give her considerable rights to carry through this investigation, as well as the principles I noted earlier in terms of the fundamental responsibilities of the Ombudsman under the act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on the appropriation bills has changed somewhat, given that the Treasurer who was responsible for the introduction of these bills is no longer here. However, we should not be too surprised by that. There has been quite an exodus of members of the government from this place during this financial year. The events of today have seen yet another minister resign her place on the front bench. I wonder what the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has planned for the future?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate on this package of appropriation bills gives me the opportunity to canvass a number of issues which affect the constituents of Cook. It is essential that members of parliament remember one central point: the No. 1 priority of all members should be to act first and foremost as representatives of the people of their electorates. Grandstanding in Canberra has never been high on my list of priorities in my long time as a member of this House. I therefore think it is always a timely reminder that this is the people's place. It is the forum in which the people are represented. That is what we, as members of this House, are paid to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it will come as no surprise that I must make some comments in relation to the sports rorts affair. This is an issue of grave concern to the people of my electorate. As I do the rounds of my electorate, I am always receiving the same message: how could the minister for the environment keep her place on the frontbench? This is recurrent comment from the people who pay&mdash;or paid&mdash;the minister's wages. The public simply cannot believe that a senior cabinet minister could not be brought to account for the most blatant abuse of administrative responsibility. Is it any wonder that the public holds a pessimistic view of the parliamentary process when the sports rorts affair has dragged on for so long? And what of the saga of the whiteboard? Surely, there has never been such a lame excuse for ineptitude as that paltry effort from the then minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did this minister really expect the general public to believe that $30 million of taxpayers' money was allocated by scribbling on a whiteboard? That just shows the degree of contempt in which this government holds the parliamentary process and the Australian people. I do not wish to dwell on this issue too much, given the numerous commentaries throughout the media which have called for the minister to be sacked and which led to her resignation this afternoon. I want to add another dimension to the issue in regard to the announcement of successful grants. I raised this issue in the House on 22 November 1993. In the light of this afternoon's events, I think it is important to raise it once again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lead-up to the last election saw a flurry of funds emanating from the minister's office. She simply could not spend the money quickly enough. I am sure that she was given a directive that the massive pork-barrelling exercise had to be rushed so that organisations would receive word of their successful applications prior to polling day. In cases where the sitting member was from the Labor Party, it was evident that the publicity machine went into overdrive to ensure that the local Labor member received as much kudos for the grant as was possible. Who can forget the picture of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) wielding his baseball bat as a testament to that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the case where the local member was not from the government, the former minister found herself in a bind. Her brief must have been to ensure that the organisation in receipt of the money must not be fooled into thinking that the local coalition member had anything to do with the grant; it was purely the benevolence of the Labor government and the Labor candidate, not the local member in that particular seat, which made the grant possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was exactly the case in my electorate. Worse still, the Labor candidate just happened to be on the staff of one of the former minister's ministerial colleagues. I do not place any blame at all on that minister whom I hold in the highest regard. However, the organisation involved with the grant, which provides an excellent service to the community, was not fooled, as the former minister had hoped. The Labor candidate contacted the president of the organisation to inform him of the success of its application for funding. This was her first contact with the organisation. This was in contrast to my long association with this organisation and also the fact that I had obtained the necessary application forms and supported its application directly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will understand my amazement some five months later, just prior to polling day, when the president of the organisation contacted me to say that he had just been informed by the local Labor candidate that the organisation's grant had been approved. I repeat that at that time the candidate was on the staff of the former federal minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps even more amazing still is the fact that the former minister for sport has still not contacted me to inform me as to whether or not this particular grant has been approved. In this case, the work has already been carried out. I still have not received any correspondence from the former minister regarding any of the applications which came from my electorate. Realistically, I do not expect to hear now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another aspect of the shameful and despicable funding program which will always be remembered as the sports rorts affair. For the Labor candidate to receive information regarding funding applications while the sitting member is totally ignored smacks of political bias of the worst kind and also illustrates the contempt with which the government holds the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first raised this issue when the former minister refused to allow the Parliamentary Library to answer queries regarding the sports rorts affair. Instead, the former minister insisted that all queries be referred to her office. I would say that, even at that time, in late November last year, the writing was on the wall for the former minister. She must have reached a desperate state of affairs when she did not possess sufficient confidence in the impartiality and expertise of the Parliamentary Library. We have seen her go down since then, dragging her ministerial colleagues, notably the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), into this smelly affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What an absolute disgrace this former minister proved to be and what a shambles has been the performance of the Prime Minister himself. The resignation this afternoon is long overdue. However, the issue of the sports rorts does not finish there. It is clear that the former minister was not acting alone and, in time, I am sure more facts will come to light regarding the whole sordid issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation debate also affords me the opportunity to yet again place on record my appreciation for the sterling efforts of the volunteer bushfire brigades in the recent fire tragedy in Sydney. As it happens, I was fortunate enough to have attended yesterday a community day for the Jannali-Como area. I am pleased to report to the House that the New South Wales Premier, John Fahey, was also in attendance at this important ceremony of some 10,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In January, 104 houses were destroyed in the Sutherland Shire by the bushfires which also tragically claimed the life of Mrs Paula O'Neil. As I said in this House on an earlier occasion, Sutherland Shire has a history of bushfires, but nothing could have prepared the residents of Jannali-Como for what happened in January. The disaster was immediate and devastating. The exact cost of the destruction may never be fully known, although the remarkable spirit shown by the residents of this area serves as an example to us all of the triumph of human spirit in times of adversity. That was what the commemoration yesterday was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record my appreciation to Tony Jackson and others associated with the organisation of the community day. It was an enjoyable, yet memorable, occasion in spite of the reason for the gathering. Countless articles have been written about the courage and dedication of the volunteer firefighters; however, it is only when one sees first-hand the devastation of the Sutherland district that one can truly gain an appreciation of the forces of nature with which the volunteers had to contend. Over 95 per cent of the famous Royal National Park in southern Sydney was destroyed in the fires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The communities of Bundeena and Maianbar, which used to form part of my electorate, were evacuated to nearby Cronulla. Understandably, a state of nervousness permeated throughout the Sutherland Shire and, with each wind of change, a new concern arose. It is a credit to the volunteers of the bushfire brigade that the list of damages was not much greater. The professionalism and dedication shown by all these brave men and women must be commended in the highest possible terms, and that is what yesterday's community parade was all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us have much to thank these people for. Their selfless attitude and strength in the most trying of circumstances will long be remembered by all of us. The mobility of all the bushfire men and women&mdash;those who lived locally, those from other areas of New South Wales and those from interstate, particularly Victoria&mdash;was nothing short of miraculous. I again extend my condolences to the family of Mrs O'Neil and wish her two daughters the very best of health as they recover from their ordeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this wide ranging debate, I also want to take the opportunity to make some comments about the Commonwealth car fleet and, in particular, Commonwealth drivers. In all my years as a member of this place, I cannot recall a time when the mood of the Commonwealth car drivers has been so sombre. I have never seen morale among the drivers so incredibly low. That is amongst the drivers who are left. I am told there are 39, compared with a previous fleet number of 89. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a shambles the ministerial directions have been for the past five to eight years. Drivers have not been told the truth of future plans in all of this period. It has been one administrative nightmare after another. I plan to talk on this subject more fully at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few minutes of my time remaining, I merely point out the problems that are now being created with the Badgerys Creek airport. I have in my hands a paper called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Flight arrivals</EMPHASIS>, which is concerned with the issues and developments affecting Badgerys Creek international airport. Here we see a Labor run council, the Penrith Council, strongly demanding that we need a 2,900-metre runway&mdash;not the 1,800-metre runway that is presently being planned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is remarkable that such a Labor council should make such a strong criticism of the government directions that have been coming its way in this matter. It criticises the federal government in this paper for the direction it has taken. Despite the recommendation of all expert bodies to create and build a longer runway that can accommodate jets, the policy is still that the runway should be only 1,800 metres, which is not sufficiently long for jet aircraft participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Mr Speaker, with your taking the chair, I gather something is about to happen in the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be the first of my colleagues to offer our appreciation for the work the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) has done, as minister, for seven years. I deeply regret the circumstances that have led to her today offering her resignation. It is the first time, as far as I can recall, that a minister has resigned without there being some suggestion of impropriety&mdash;or some potential for impropriety&mdash;or inappropriate behaviour. Apparently she did not mislead parliament, to the extent that the scheme apparently did not incorporate in the eligible categories organisations wishing to purchase brass band equipment. Clearly, that was wrong. It should never have been the case. Perhaps it was not thought of by the bureaucracy at the time, but the fact that sporting equipment and artistic or cultural equipment could be bought with the funds but equipment for a youth band could not was clearly an oversight that the former minister corrected, and apparently in correcting it she inadvertently misled parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My major concern is that the judgment passed by some is both unjust and undeserved. I am sure that history will recognise the honourable member's contribution to this government as being a substantial one and one which is worthy of much better treatment than she has received in recent months. The slanderous and despicable behaviour that I have seen in this House week after week for some months now has not just appalled myself but I am sure has dragged down the standards of behaviour of parliamentarians throughout the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally important as the treatment of the former sports minister is the scheme itself. The scheme was enormously important to regional Australia. The fact is that, until the scheme was introduced, the Commonwealth government contributed nothing to sporting facilities for people outside capital cities. If one lived in Sydney or Melbourne then the state provided facilities of a national or international standard but if one lived in regional Australia then basically there was no such support. Because of this scheme, regional areas now have world-class facilities, such as Newcastle's hockey facility. It would be an absolute tragedy if the very despicable actions of those opposite lead not just to the minister's resignation but to the total termination of the program. It would be a tragedy for sport and it would be a tragedy for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make sure that the opposition knows that in the months and years ahead we will be reminding sporting bodies around the country of how anti sport opposition members have been and how, in their attempt to belittle and tear down one person, they have in fact done enormous damage to the potential and the capacity of Australian taxpayers to support the national contribution to sporting facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) shaking his head. Let me tell him that in the last three months the coalition has done enormous damage to the potential of sporting facilities all over Australia to be funded by the Commonwealth. We would go back to the days where the Commonwealth basically said that sport and sporting facilities were matters for state and local governments and the Commonwealth was not involved. That is the likely outcome, by association, because the implication has been there was some lack of accounting, which clearly is not true. The acquittal of funds was always properly conducted and, financially, the audit trail was always there. I have never before heard of an audit trail for ministerial discretion. I have never before heard of an audit trail for how people make up their minds or make subjective judgments, but I will be interested to hear in the months ahead the kind of justification opposition members will use as they try to do a backflip and justify their actions to sporting bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody is going to justify to people who wrote to ministers year after year seeking more and more funding for sporting facilities in their electorates why the scheme has been terminated. I think that is a great tragedy. It is not just a personal tragedy for the honourable member for Canberra to be brought down in such an unscrupulous way; it is a national tragedy for regional Australia and its sporting capacities. Not one person opposite was prepared to defend and support the need for regional Australia to get access to national revenue for these facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Appropriation bills Nos 3 and 4 arise from the budget brought down in August last year. While that is only six months ago, the change in the economy in that six months has been quite dramatic. Look at where the national and international economies were back in August last year. In the middle of last year Japan introduced even further measures to recover its economy; the American economy was still sluggish, although apparently recovering; and Europe had been through some major crises in terms of internal currencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a national level the Australian recovery was still not recognised as such by the community. However, between then and now we have seen quite substantial indications of recovery coming through, firstly in the national economy, with low interest rates and CPI, with the inflation rate now being below two per cent&mdash;which is well below budget projections&mdash;and of course with our growth rate well above budget projections. So the appropriations in this legislation come from a budget which has now been shown, following stronger economic results than were anticipated, to have been a very cautious budget. As well as that, the government took action two years ago through the One Nation statement. These measures, combined with the wage and productivity changes and the restructuring of our internal economy both within enterprises and within government, mean that we have, perhaps for the first time in 30 or more years, a conjunction of capacity in terms of interest rates, profitability and productivity that will allow this recovery to be one that has both long-term benefits and can be maintained in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one had said a year or two ago, or even six months ago, that the Australian economy could recover&mdash;and recover strongly&mdash;with low inflation while, at the same time, Japan and Germany were in recession, one's judgment would have been thought to have been suspect because, historically, if either Japan or Germany was in recession then automatically Australia would be. The fact that we are recovering so well despite what is happening in Japan is cause for great encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there also must be cause for concern in relation to the current American-Japanese negotiations. Clearly a trade war between those two countries does not help anybody but, equally clearly, one cannot go wrong arguing for more open trade when one observes some of the non-tariff barriers that some countries apply. Australia in some ways has cause to complain about both Japan and America because both offer resistance to Australian products and both are fairly selective in how they interpret the words `free' and `fair'. Despite that, the fact is that the GATT round has now been agreed to, albeit in a modified form, so clearly there is a shift in world trends and in the way the world is approaching trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short term the effects of that will be marginal but what is important is that in the longer term this will be of enormous benefit to Australia. At that same time, we are watching the Asian nations find a new sense of maturity and a new sense of purpose in their own economic developments. For the first time in our history, Australia is tapping into a growth in manufactured exports. The fact that in the last financial year we exported more products we made than products we grew stands as a quite remarkable record. The fact that we exported more manufactured goods than primary industry products must leave many of our critics somewhat confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, the history of the Australian manufacturing industry shows that the policy was essentially a diversion. Behind high protection, high tariffs and artificial currencies was the idea that our manufacturing was basically to keep people out of mischief while the real trade went on in primary industries and resources. Now that manufacturing has established itself as a viable export, we are looking towards a much more skilled and capable work force in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have a highly capable and a highly competitive engineering capacity. That has been recognised by many people for a long time, but as a country we have only started to market that capacity in recent years. I am confident that in the years ahead we will maintain our manufacturing potential and competitive capacity to export not just our manufactured products but also our design skills. Australian engineers are of a very high calibre in world terms and they are recognised as being innovative and very competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are approaching the 11th anniversary of the election of a Labor government in 1983 and the first anniversary of the current government. That is why it is important that we start to take a broader perspective of this budget and its appropriations. Clearly, we have a problem with long-term unemployment. It is of fundamental importance that our sense of fairness and justice is not forgotten amongst the economic data. There is a danger that a number of people will be left standing on the sidelines as the economy continues to recover unless we take overt action, unless we consciously and quite deliberately put programs in place that will assist not just the economy and the community but individuals and that people perceive it as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, a number of programs such as jobstart, jobskills, LEAP and a variety of others target particularly the long-term unemployed. In many cases, they are aimed at work experience, work support or some form of training. We hear much criticism, understandably, about the purpose of training schemes when there is a shortage of employment, but if we do not train those people who have been out of work for some time as employment appears they will miss out&mdash;the chicken and egg situation&mdash;because they will not be able to compete in the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that unemployment is high seems to imply somehow that the economy has actually shrunk. As mentioned again today in question time, in the last 11 years our work force has grown by something like 1.2 million people. There are 1.2 million more people working now than there were when we came into government. So the work force has grown virtually every year in net terms. Despite that, the number of those available for work has grown faster. That is what we are talking about. The actual growth in the participation rate, which is the size of the work force as a part of the total community, has grown as has the population overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we understand that, unlike New Zealand for example&mdash;a model which is often used against us&mdash;our work force has grown as our economy has grown. In response to those circumstances, the government is taking serious action and we are looking towards a statement on both employment and industry by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and other ministers in the next six weeks or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is in fairly stark contrast to what has been happening in the parliament itself in recent months. The opposition has been preoccupied not with the unemployed, not with ways of generating skills. I think the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) put it very clearly today. We are getting letters from so many people in the community&mdash;church organisations, community groups and individuals&mdash;with ideas, suggestions and proposals on what we as a government should be doing to help support those without work in our community, yet the opposition is not contributing one bit. We are not seeing any real care. We are seeing crocodile tears when it suits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, for many months now the opposition has ignored the potential to contribute to question time and parliamentary debate. In the 11 years that I have been here, I cannot recall a time when an opposition has been so bereft of ideas. I cannot recall a time when an opposition has made a conscious decision to have no policies. Previously, opposition policies were always under way or at least had been announced somewhere. For almost a year now, the opposition has almost been making having no policies a virtue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community and those who support that side of politics&mdash;that is a substantial number of Australians&mdash;must be greatly discouraged to recognise that those who represent them have no ideas to put forward and no solutions or proposals. Simply, all they have done is attack people's characters. The opposition has attacked the honourable member for Canberra and the Prime Minister and I do not doubt that there will be attacks on other ministers. I think the articles in the weekend papers on that topic are revealing. The opposition demonstrates a paucity of morality but, more importantly, a paucity of ideas and principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the months ahead we will see more of the same&mdash;no policies, personal attacks and attempts at vilification and to drag people down. I think Mr Fraser's comments on that were fairly pertinent. If the opposition thinks that today's resignation by the honourable member for Canberra as Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories is a victory, I am afraid it is wrong. If there is any glee from those opposite about that, I think in the months ahead they will find that Australians will judge them harshly for the kind of behaviour that the former minister has responded to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are entering or going through a fairly strong recovery. It is important that both the government and the nation focus on the depth and structure of that recovery so that it is sustainable and that we do not go back to our boom-bust cycles. If one goes into factories nowadays compared with, say, 11 years ago, whilst the buildings look the same on the outside, the interiors are totally different in that we have seen a whole new approach from the work force and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea that management and workers can actually work together is no longer some wild scheme; it is now a reality in factories throughout the country. Because of that, we are seeing productivity and profitability in companies like never before. I can recall being told by some managers of companies in my area years ago that it was very difficult for them to get investment from their boards when the best a company could make was 10 or 12 per cent profit and that they could invest in the money market and make more. I know that in my first year Telecom bonds were paying 14 per cent. Why would one invest in production and hope to make 10 or 12 per cent if one can passively invest and make more?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is now more profitable than almost any other investment. I see a shift happening right now&mdash;and I am sure that it will continue&mdash;from passive investment to active investment. Between dividend imputation, the corporate tax rate and the R&amp;D tax write-off and internal wage restructuring, productivity and enterprise bargaining, the best investment people can make nowadays is in production. It is the best short-term investment and I am sure that it will be the best long-term investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, our performance in exports of manufactured goods is now established. It is not a one-off, a flash in the pan and not some fluke. It is part of a long-term process by our businesses to learn and cope with marketing in the international context, particularly into Asia. Those achievements are there. The task for the government and those on this side of the House is to make those changes work more effectively, to finetune them and to keep them going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather unfortunate that we are constantly being diverted from focusing on that objective by the kind of trivia and demeaning politics that we have seen in recent months. Eventually, vilification, politics of personality and personal attacks are no answer to policy or constructive process. I have no doubt that, with the change of opposition leadership which will occur in the next few months, those opposite will suddenly have a rush of blood to the head and they will find that policy is important after all. This wide ranging debate is important because it allows us to look at the bigger picture and the important picture. The tragedy is that the opposition seems to be using it for personal grandstanding rather than as a constructive process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today in speaking to these appropriation bills to look at a number of areas of regional development. I am pleased that the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) said that there is no-one on this side who is particularly interested in what the sporting grants might have done for regional Australia. I for one am very interested. I have a continuing interest and I think parts of regional Australia, especially those that were represented by the National Party, were very badly treated. It is pleasing to see my colleague the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) sitting here beside me because his electorate was graced with one such grant, announced by the Labor candidate for his seat, not by the sitting member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Although ostensibly a borderline Labor electorate and therefore very well treated, there are parts of the regional aspect of my electorate, places such as the developing areas of Agnes Water and the town of 1770, that scream out to heaven for development and where well-structured grants were not even considered, yet those of lower grading were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Newcastle also talked about paucity of morality and paucity of ideas. I was subjected to a vitriolic attack by my predecessor over the Bundaberg Netball Association, claiming that I had bagged it. In fact, his state colleague the member for Bundaberg, Mr Campbell, claimed that I had tainted it. As honourable members would know, not one member of the National Party or the Liberal Party at any stage bagged that organisation, which is a particularly well-run and well-focused organisation which carries out activities that give thousands of young people a year a chance to play one of Australia's most popular sports. I understand that netball is Australia's second most popular sport. Our particular beef was not with that association, but with the fact that the guidelines were not adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find even more interesting is that my predecessor at no time briefed that organisation. Even though he was able to lend his name in support of the application, he never at any stage warned the association that its application was not within the guidelines. It is equally strange that the former minister did not give that organisation the opportunity, as she did in many other electorates in which applications did not qualify, to modify the application. Let it be put clearly on the record today that neither I, my party or for that matter the Liberal Party cast any aspersions against the Bundaberg Netball Association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Newcastle said, we need to be focusing on regional Australia. Returning to the subject of finance, I would like to touch on the matter of sales tax. Sales tax, as one member described it this morning, is one of the most insidious forms of taxation. It is never seen, yet every trolley that goes through every checkout in every supermarket in Australia is just alive with sales tax. Despite its great moral indignation over the GST and its distortion of the facts at the time of the last election and since, to say nothing of its promise that there would be no new taxes, the government has beset the Australian public with a one per cent sales tax levy on everything. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KV5">Mr NEVILLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our 15 per cent would have been offset by the removal of all sales tax. The parliamentary secretary knows full well that the 30 per cent, 20 per cent and 10 per cent would have come off to be replaced by the 15 per cent. But it is convenient to put that to one side and let that distortion of the truth continue ad nauseam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a promise of no new taxes yet we are beset with this one per cent increase in the level of sales tax. I find it extraordinarily interesting that this government should talk about a GST. Is a blanket one per cent increase across the board&mdash;I am not talking about restructuring sales tax itself&mdash;not a consumption tax? Is that not just another name for a hidden consumption tax? Indeed, that is what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not here today to bag the government unnecessarily. In fact, I am here to appeal to its better instincts. The honourable member for Newcastle was appealing for new ideas. I am just about to throw a few out, so the parliamentary secretary should get his notebook out and jot them down because I am going to be creative. These are the areas I want to touch on. I accept that the government has the right to raise taxes and, reluctantly, we all have to pay them. But, even within the framework, the government could exercise its prerogatives with a great deal more focus and sensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to talk first about school buses. School buses are a very important part of the life of rural Australia. They bring children from all sorts of country and outlying areas to schools that are not all that great themselves in terms of size, but they are the fabric of education for people who do not enjoy the pleasures of living in the capital and provincial cities. I think we could also say that these school buses could hardly be described as lavish instruments of travel, nor could we say that those who run these buses make a great deal of money out of them. They are very marginal activities at the best of times, but they are a basic community service and a vital one at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the matter of safety comes up from time to time. I think we are all mindful of the two tragic bus crashes at Kempsey and Grafton of recent times and the tremendous toll of human life that those two crashes took. I suppose we have been pretty fortunate with school buses, although, sadly, there have been deaths on school buses. School buses have rolled over and things like that. We have been mercifully spared great tragedies on that front. Nevertheless, we should not go on with the belief, as we did with the interstate coaches, that this cannot happen because it happened once and it happened all too quickly on a second occasion, with horrendous loss of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently in Queensland the state authorities brought in a system of auditing steep grades on school bus runs. The idea of that is that school buses for those in mountainous or undulating areas need to be fitted with special safety equipment; namely, brake retarders. These will cost the operators of these buses up to $11,000. One operator in my area, Peter Wilson of Gin Gin, operates a Nissan civilian omnibus in the Kalpowar area, which is a timber growing area near Monto in the north west of my electorate. He will be required to fit these drive line retarders to his braking system and that will set him back $11,000. I believe that is an unacceptable burden for small bus operators to carry when the focus of that activity is safety. Equally, if the state authorities, or indeed school bus operators, on a voluntary basis want to fit their school buses with seat belts, I think that should be exempt from sales tax, too. This would be a very simple and practical way for us to get fair dinkum. Mr Deputy Speaker, that is my creative thought to you today about safety and safety for children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am on the theme of safety, I would like to mention an exchange I have had&mdash;friendly enough, I might admit&mdash;with the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) regarding EPIRBs, which is, for those who are not familiar with that term, emergency position indicating radio beacons. An EPIRB is fitted to any form of naval craft&mdash;military, civilian, private or commercial&mdash;and will very readily identify the location of a ship or vessel in distress. One of the sad ironies of this is that, if a vessel by its very nature is exempt from sales tax&mdash;for example, if a trawler were being built to go fishing in the components would be exempt from sales tax&mdash;then these EPIRBS would also be exempt from sales tax. But if they are fitted to a pleasure vessel&mdash;a pleasure vessel is a very broad definition; it might even apply to the tinny in which we go out and throw out a line on a weekend's fishing&mdash;then sales tax applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland state government is looking at making these safety beacons compulsory, and I commend it for that. But I think it will impose an unnecessary constraint on safety equipment. It will make it much harder for people to put them on. I suppose there will always be the odd character who runs the risk of his tinny getting into trouble, his motor cutting out, and drifting out to sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw to the attention of the House the difference between this rather small exemption and what we pay when someone is lost at sea. Sometimes four or five people on a small vessel go out to sea. If their outboard motor cuts out and they drift away from the safety of land, there is an absolutely massive rescue operation. Aircraft, helicopters, air sea rescue and all sorts of people are involved in finding that vessel. At times we hear of the expenditure involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the fact that people need to be protected at sea, we often forget about the pilots who go out in appalling conditions and the air sea rescue people who similarly go out in times of distress&mdash;on many occasions without any consideration for their own safety. It often puts these voluntary workers at unnecessary risk and, as I said before, the state and Commonwealth authorities are involved in inordinate costs. If these beacons were fitted to all craft in such circumstances, there would be great savings to the nation. If we could pinpoint a vessel in distress in a matter of minutes, just think how simple it would be to save life and expense. Again, it comes back to a simple sales tax matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last five or six minutes I have available, I want to talk about sales tax in regional development. I will be creative. There is a lot of talk going on at present about regional development. It will be the flavour of the month, I suspect, between now and the next election. Regional development is most misunderstood in Australia. More sins are committed in the name of regional development than anything else I know of. There is a feeling that some nebulous white knight is going to charge out into the regional and rural areas of Australia and provide a framework under which we will be able to fix up all the nation's ills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He got closer than most. I would like to touch briefly on regional tourist authorities and industry development authorities. In some states they are controlled totally by the state government: two examples are New South Wales with its new tourist authorities and Western Australia with its regional development authorities. Where the organisation is totally funded by local authorities, a state government, or a combination of both, it is exempt from sales tax. However, the states that have a combination of state government, local authority and private subscribers' money&mdash;as is the case in Queensland, for example&mdash;are sales tax exempt, except in the tourist industry for regional brochuring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bodies that are driving the government dollar further have to pay sales tax on the computer database that might store information on the hotels, motels, caravan parks and the tourist attractions of the area. It is a legitimate form of modern communications and promotion, yet sales tax has to be paid. Sales tax is paid on the photocopier that does all the internal printing, such as accommodation guides and the sorts of things which people travelling through provincial and regional areas require and demand. The regional practitioner, the guy who has to go around and keep the whole show together, has to get around in a vehicle. But that too is not exempt from sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be fair dinkum about regional development. I have just given three examples, but there are countless other items that regional tourist authorities need to use that are not exempt from sales tax and could be. As I said, the irony is that, where an organisation is run by the state government or a local authority, the whole thing is sales tax free. Yet, when business gets in behind the government, throws its weight in and drives the government dollar further, it has the added penalty of having to pay sales tax. It is just illogical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us move to the regional development organisations, which are sometimes tourism and sometimes just industry and regional development. They are the white knights that government departments come out to when there is a new government program, an OLMA program on the go&mdash;`Can you run with this or can you run that?'. I do not criticise that in any way; I think it is quite appropriate that they should. However, they have to source the projects and the opportunities. They have to form the prima facie case to put to government, prepare the submissions, run the study or the project, frequently providing all the resource backup&mdash;the computers, photocopies and vehicles which we spoke about&mdash;provide skilled staff, report on the study or the project and have to account with audited statements. We know how important that is from what has gone on with the sports rorts affair over the last few weeks. Most importantly, when the study or project is finished, an organisation needs to run with that idea or that project and take it on into the next phase. It should not be another study that gets pidgeonholed and put away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the regional organisation is a state or local authority instrumentality, sales tax exemption applies and there are no problems at all. But, where private industry gets in with government or local government to do the same job, sales tax is levied. The computer that holds the data on the region&mdash;its resources, its skills and local authority zoning data&mdash;the photocopier that puts out all the information and the vehicle that the practitioner has to drive around in to keep the region together are all subject to the levying of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I intend to speak about this matter a lot more when we see the Kelty report and the final documents from the IC inquiry into regional industry adjustment.

As one honourable member noted in his speech, the appropriation bills give members an opportunity to air their views on ideas of major economic and social concern to the nation. Having listened to and read these debates, I have come to two very valid conclusions: firstly, members on both sides of the House have the interests of their constituents and indeed the interests of the nation at heart; and, secondly, nobody in this House, I guess on either side, has a monopoly on the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an eerie commonality of agreement about the problems which we consider need to be urgently tackled if the nation is to progress in an economic and social sense and if living standards are to be maintained and improved. The great divergence of view in this House centres more on the means than on the ends. Having said that, I do not underrate the deep and real differences that exist between those on this side of the House and those opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the Australian people had a democratic opportunity to assess the respective visions for this nation and it is now a fact of Australian political history that, in the midst of global change and domestic uncertainty, the Australian people chose the Labor Party's vision for Australia. One reason why the people of this nation warmed to our vision is the Australian Labor Party's deep and abiding concern for the disadvantaged and the dispossessed in our society and our willingness to commit the resources of government to provide all Australians with an expanded opportunity to feed and clothe their families, to be housed, to work, and to contribute to the life of their local and national communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the opportunity to work that I wish to focus my attention on in this debate. Many words have been spoken in this parliament on economic policy and on the problems of the unemployed. No-one on either side of this House seeks to dismiss the dreadful human cost to those who seek to obtain work but cannot find it. For Labor members in government there can be no greater concern than unemployment. We all seek an appropriate policy framework that allows enterprises to grow and to create employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party acknowledges the historical reality of Australia's mixed economy and sees as its primary economic task to encourage greater economic efficiency and productivity in both the public and the private sectors. We acknowledge the role of the market as a primary allocator of scarce resources in this economy, but we also appreciate and understand the capacity of the market to fail. We do not hesitate to bring the resources of government or the influence of government to bear on the market in pursuit of the larger social and economic goals that this great social democratic party has determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we can look down the time tunnel as to where the economy ought to be going, we ought to appreciate and make a realistic assessment of where the economy is at this point in time. The snapshot that I intend to draw for the House will be as clinical as I can make it. I acknowledge the problems that exist in the Australian economy, but I wish also to acknowledge the great strides that have been made over the past decade in the area of economic policy and to acknowledge the contribution of the economic ministers who have formed the backbone of the Labor government  in  power  from  1983  to  this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's international competitiveness is the best that it has been for some 30 years. We have seen improvements over the last decade of some 30 per cent in Australia's competitive position. Our inflation rate is now running at about two per cent, which is the lowest it has been for some 30 years. Although interest rates reached a peak throughout the 1980s, we see now that they are the lowest that they have been for some 20 years. As far as the profitability of Australian enterprises is concerned, today we observed record profit levels being experienced in the business sector. We have ushered in a cooperative industrial relations system that is seeing the lowest level of disputation since the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the taxation regime for individuals and businesses, we have moved Australia from being a high tax country compared with its OECD competitors to a low tax country. That is a proposition that some in our community really do not want to acknowledge, but it is a fact of our commercial life. We have seen positive economic growth for the last nine quarters and the expectation is that the economy will grow faster than the official predictions that were made in the last budget. Since August we have seen the economy generate some 145,000 jobs and, in the year to September 1993, productivity has grown by 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, over the 1980s we have seen a change in business culture. We have seen business focus itself more on exporting. We have seen a greater emphasis on quality management at all levels in enterprises. We have seen a greater emphasis on training, on research and development and on best practice. These are encouraging developments. We will not see the sustained growth in the Australian economy unless the changes in the business culture permeate down especially to our small and medium enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The improved competitiveness in the Australian economy today is due to the low level of inflation that is currently being experienced, the depreciation of the Australian dollar, reductions that we have engineered in our relative unit labour costs throughout the 1980s, the gains that we have achieved in the area of micro-economic reform, and the productivity growth that I just mentioned. All these factors position the Australian economy to take advantage of the growth that is now taking place and that will take place in the international economy over the years to the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight the important improvements that we have made to our export performance. In 1983, exports comprised some 13 per cent of our GDP and in 1993 they comprised some 20 per cent of our GDP. There has been a dramatic shift within exports. We are not just exporting raw materials; we have seen a significant and massive shift to elaborately transformed manufactures. Also we have seen a dramatic growth in the export of services. In the period from 1986 to 1992, Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures grew in the order of 19 per cent compared with an average of some 11 per cent for our trading partners. That is a very important achievement. In the micro-economic reform area, this government has undertaken the task of transforming the economy from an inefficient, in the main uncompetitive, inward looking industrial structure to an internationally competitive one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our past achievements in the areas of the waterfront, industrial relations, transport and telecommunications are milestone achievements for any government in power throughout the world in the 1980s. The present focus of micro-economic reform was articulated at the COAG meeting held last week, where major agreement was reached between the Commonwealth and state governments on the micro-economic reform agenda that will take us through to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sound a note of caution about the thrust to competition policy. I do not think anybody disagrees substantially with the notion that competition brings out the best in enterprises and that it ought to be an objective for any industrial structure. An unbridled competitive policy has the potential to generate significant unemployment. That is something that we ought to keep our minds on as we move into this new phase of the micro-economic reform agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment has lagged the general recovery, and capacity utilisation has been low in recent years. However, as growth continues, there will be a greater inducement for firms to invest. Coming on the back of the incentives that the government has already put in place over the 1980s and in the One Nation statement in the recent budget, that will certainly give a stimulus to investment over the next two years of the life of this government. In 1992, in the One Nation statement we saw accelerated depreciation allowances. We have seen reductions in company tax to 33 per cent, a 10 per cent general investment allowance and development allowances. The total cost of those measures to government revenue has been in the order of $800 million. It is not an unsubstantial incentive to the business community to invest in Australian enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other factors in the economy at present that are conducive to this impetus for greater investment. I mentioned high profitability levels. The interest rate regime is low, inflation is low, and inflationary expectations are also low. The consumer outlook is positive, and we have seen the general improvement in competitiveness. All those factors will improve business investment in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the export orientation of the Australian economy is concerned, there has been a deliberate government policy to foster a closer engagement in the Asia-Pacific region on a political, cultural and economic level. Our participation in APEC is central to those efforts. Our efforts over the 1980s have been rewarded. Exports to this dynamic growth region of the world&mdash;the east Asia region, including Japan&mdash;now account for some 60 per cent of all our exports. This focus does not necessarily mean that we have to abandon other global regions throughout the world. As we progress to the year 2000, I am sure that we will see the export gun sights turn on other regions of the world to stimulate our export performance. As a government, we have not been afraid to enter the zone of policy development in the industry area, nor to enter the zone of devising policies to overcome unemployment and to take up the regional policy development debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amidst the positive news on the economy, there are two major persistent problems. I refer to the high level of  unemployment, which is now around 10.6 per cent, and the external deficit on the current account. The solutions that we devise ought to aim, where possible, at overcoming those two problems. The strategy ought to be to lower the demand for imports and to generate demand for locally produced goods and services. It is naive and foolhardy to suggest that any one set of measures has all the answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's contribution to a solution falls in two areas. It falls in getting the macro settings right and devising a specific set of measures that will stimulate investment and consumption in the domestic economy. I suggest that there is a range of such measures that the government, within its existing resources, can bring to bear on the problem. In a recent forum within my own parliamentary party, I outlined a set of initiatives that, in addition to the growth generated by the recovery already under way, would further stimulate domestic demand and assist the creation of over 200,000 jobs. Most of the proposals are based on the fundamental premise that employment can be stimulated in the private sector by stimulating demand, and they really do obviate the need for any jobs levy. I am not convinced that a jobs levy is necessary in the current economic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study undertaken by Professor Jensen on the impact of new and retained manufacturing activity on general economic activity was submitted in evidence to the parliamentary inquiry on government purchasing. That evidence was given by the Industrial Supplies Office. It indicated that each $1 million of new or retained manufacturing activity in Australia could be expected to produce approximately 29 new jobs, some $28,000 in taxes and charges at all levels of government, $255,000 in direct consumer expenditure, and $231,000 in welfare savings to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five points that I proposed and outlined have the capacity, as I stated, to generate some 200,000 jobs. The first point, which I think the government will give consideration to in its budget deliberations, is a stimulus to infrastructure spending, which will be related closely to labour market programs and targeted to the long-term unemployed. The government is entering a fiscal position where it will be able to undertake additional expenditures. As the economy recovers and gathers pace, and as employment grows, the government will reap expenditure savings and revenue gains from that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various program vehicles have been oiled through the One Nation process, in partnership with state and local government, which can be brought to bear as vehicles on this particular problem. I refer to the better cities program, the local capital works program, general road funding, the LEAP, and the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program, which ought to be reinstated in the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our aim in this infrastructure spending should be to generate some 40,000 to 50,000 jobs. If honourable members do have some concerns about the fiscal capacity of the Commonwealth to undertake this infrastructure expenditure, I refer them to the rather innovative taxation proposals that were tabled by the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) and outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative that I think can be taken up is to strengthen the Industrial Supplies Office network. For firms to take on additional units of labour, they need access to more business. Some of that business will come from the effects of general recovery, but they need access to import replacement business, which will build solidly on that normal growth. I think the Industrial Supplies Office has a greater role to play here. It can be expanded in providing for regional firms to be included in regional databases and developing a more sophisticated national database. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have an interesting example of the involvement of the ISO in my electorate. It was founded and trialled first in my electorate, and I am hoping that in the next budget the ISO can be brought home to Geelong. I have put forward a proposal. Our target ought to be to divert consumption from some half a billion dollars worth of expenditure on imports to domestic manufacturing. That has the capacity to produce some 15,000 to 20,000 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area which I think offers some great opportunities for stimulating employment growth is a reorientation of government purchasing policy. The current inquiry into the government's purchasing policy indicates that there is much more that we can do to link this purchasing policy to industry development and employment creation. Local, state and federal expenditures total some $30 billion. Our aim ought to be to divert $3 billion of that to local manufacturing over the next three years, with a net gain to employment of some 90,000. What is required is the political will. By comparison with other countries in this area, we are very poor indeed. Much more can be done in that particular area to stimulate job growth. I think there ought to be a massive expansion of the buy Australian campaign to tackle the culture of consumption in the country, which is inherently biased against Australian manufacturers. It is an issue that I will take up in a later speech to the parliament. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, in apologising I will explain the circumstances behind the uproar during last Thursday's sitting. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) moved a motion of censure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and, in so doing, forfeited our right to ask questions. Of course, it is our right as the opposition, with the role of keeping the government accountable, to move a motion of censure against the Prime Minister for his faithful protection of an incompetent minister who is both morally and politically corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were abused for abandoning question time. But this was a most important motion and one which we had a responsibility to move. We decided to abandon question time and bring the motion straight on in light of the repeated failure of the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), to answer any questions and given the fact that the Prime Minister had prepared seven dorothy dixers in which he would have launched a tirade of abuse at us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition had an obligation to bring the Prime Minister to account for his loyalty to a most incompetent, corrupt and dishonest minister, the former Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Leader of the Opposition completed his speech, the coalition had two choices, as far as I can see: firstly, to allow the Prime Minister, in silence and in respect of standing orders, to launch a tirade of abuse at the coalition for the press gallery to lap up; or, secondly, to do unto the Prime Minister as the Labor Party did to the Leader of the Opposition. With reluctance, we took the second option. We decided to give the Prime Minister and the Labor Party a taste of their own medicine. As we all know now, they absolutely hated it. They can dish it out, but, boy oh boy, when it came time to take it, they could not take it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first interjection was met by retaliation from the Speaker. Similar protection was not afforded to the Leader of the Opposition. The fact that the public gallery erupted into spontaneous applause when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) pleaded for fairer play from the Speaker is indicative of the way this debate was perceived by the people of Australia. They acknowledged that the then minister was morally and politically corrupt, that the Prime Minister deserved to be censured, that the government's tactics in stymieing the debate were blatantly unfair and that the Speaker's failure to discipline government members was a sad indictment of the falling standards we are seeing in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well understand why the public would be dismayed about last Thursday's performance. We should all hang our heads in shame, for it was a black day for this fine institution of democracy. Nevertheless, while I apologise to the people of Australia, and the people of Stirling in particular, for our behaviour, I say that the coalition had no other choice than to give the Labor Party a taste of its own medicine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thursday also showed us that the Labor Party shows continuing utter contempt for the institution of the parliament and has little regard for its procedures and rules and for the way it should operate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I was most concerned at the thuggery tactics of certain government members, particularly those of the New South Wales right, whom I have already mentioned, led by leaping, leaking Leo, the honourable member for Watson. Those government members had a prearranged agenda to harass opposition members and audit office staff. They attempted to protect the minister in their various ways, even trying to answer questions asked of her when she appeared at a public hearing of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts.

They should hang their heads in shame for their appalling conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the minister came to the committee hearing, these same members&mdash;with the exception of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), whom I must commend for not attempting to pervert the proceedings of the committee&mdash;abused members of the public gallery. They interjected questions as a form of protecting the minister, and they even attempted to answer questions asked of the minister, showing that she did not know many answers and thus required protection. Finally, they again heckled and abused coalition members for questions which we had the temerity to ask. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to comment on the conduct of the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), who accused coalition members of leaking the draft report of the committee to various journalists. These were unfounded, unsubstantiated, spurious allegations. The chairman, who has repeatedly accused opposition members of leaking information, made such allegations without substance or evidence. His partisan comments make him unfit to be chairman when his position demands that he be impartial. In view of the chairman's having expressed his biased ideas, I believe that he has no course other than to resign. I shall be pursuing that further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This affair has also shown that the government has no standards for ministers to abide by. It is now necessary for the Prime Minister to establish a code of conduct which ministers must follow to ensure that they remain accountable to parliament and, in particular, the people of Australia, whom we represent here. The code should be a strict guideline detailing the standards of accountability which must be met by a minister. If these standards are not met, that minister should be met with strict discipline by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Prime Minister adopts such a code, which should be very specific as to the detail of accountability required of ministers. Failure to require any such standards would be an admission that the Prime Minister cares little for accountability in government, which is anathema to the principles of democracy which we hold so dear in our proud nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, on this issue, which I assure honourable members will not be laid to rest for quite a while, I suggest to the relevant minister's office that it seeks to acquire better technological mechanisms by which to operate. The former minister's use of a whiteboard is now well known, even though none of us were able to get to see it&mdash;but we do not bother about that now. It was improper, to say the least, for the former minister to dish out $30 million in grants using a whiteboard as the major instrument of recording data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the new minister that, if he is to allocate grants under such a program in the future, a whiteboard is certainly not the way to go. I suggest the purchase of an appropriate computer software package, such as Lotus 1,2,3 or Microsoft Excel, which would keep records, assist in choosing the neediest applicants and would not be easily erasable&mdash;that is, if the new minister abandons recent practices of being politically biased and blatantly unfair in the allocation of grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to make a few comments on the forthcoming Fremantle by-election. On 12 March, for the second time in a year, the people of Fremantle in Western Australia will go to the polls to select their federal representative. John Dawkins has decided to call it quits and abandon them&mdash;just as the Labor candidate has done to people living in the state seat of Glendalough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the Labor Party wanting a new high profile female member because, after the performance of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly), there is a vacancy on the front bench. The unfortunate thing for those opposite is that, when we look beyond the glossy media image of Carmen Lawrence, there is a very messy, very deceitful and very unrepresentative history. I can tell honourable members that I have been following the antics of this woman for quite some time!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need only remind the House that late in 1989, just prior to her knifing the former Premier Peter Dowding in the back, Dr Feelgood, as she is often called, received $5,000 of public money&mdash;that is, taxpayers' money&mdash;to finance an overseas trip associated with her then portfolio responsibilities. She did not go on this trip, but guess what happened to the $5,000 of taxpayers' money? It stayed in her account for a couple of years and gathered interest for her. She says she did not realise it was in her account. Oh, to have so much money that you do not notice an extra five grand! Either she went to the Ros Kelly school of ministerial responsibility and accountability or she must be very rich indeed not to notice an extra five grand in the account. Remember, this was taxpayers' money stored in her bank account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then again, Carmen Lawrence is an extraordinarily forgetful person, as I am sure the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) will attest. If honourable members cast their minds back to the WA Inc. royal commission&mdash;something Carmen Lawrence played a part in; she is as responsible as Brian Burke and Peter Dowding for having squandered hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars&mdash;they will recall that three particular questions were asked of Dr Lawrence. First, did she believe that the purpose and effect of the government involvement in PCIL were fully and accurately explained to the public? Her answer was: `I cannot recall'. Second, did she attend a cabinet meeting in July 1988 when two ministers discussed Rothwells' financial position?  Her answer: `No recollection of it'. Finally, during 1988, when the SGIC and GESB each supported Rothwells to the tune of $50 million, when did she become aware of such support being proposed? Her answer was that she had no direct knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to honourable members that Carmen Lawrence, having sat through those cabinet meetings during the WA Inc. years, when the money was being squandered, is either incredibly stupid or is an out and out untruth teller.

Yet, in the way she does things, she displays all the hallmarks of the former minister for sports.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bills provide funding for the activities of the Commonwealth government. It is a fact that government in Australia is neither high taxing nor high spending. Government taxes and expenditures as a proportion of gross domestic product are among the lowest in the OECD. Thankfully, now the Australian people have rejected the burden of a ruinous goods and services tax urged by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), Australia will remain a low tax country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government wishes to preserve and enhance the institutions that have served the Australian people well. It is a government that seeks to uphold the values of the Australian people. In contrast to the members of the opposition, we on this side of the House know that sound and vigorous leadership is the essence of good government. Nowhere is this more important than in developing the economy of this nation. When they were in government, the Liberal and National parties left Australia with a high cost, grossly inefficient and protected industry, double-digit inflation, double-digit interest rates, double-digit unemployment and chronic balance of payment problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has shown the leadership to reverse the insular, inward looking culture of Australia developed over years of Liberal-National rule. Australians are now major participants in the growth opportunities emerging in Asia. Australians now have embraced the challenge of building an open and internationally competitive economy. Our industry is becoming proud to talk about its successes in innovation, worker relations and profitability. Ten years ago industry policy was governed by the handout mentality of the agrarian socialists in the coalition, and industry was only rewarded for failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this government the Australian economy has grown in real terms at a rate of 3.1 per cent annually. This performance exceeded average growth across all OECD countries of 2.7 per cent over the same period. Currently the Australian economy is moving forward at 3.4 per cent per annum&mdash;one of the highest rates of expansion in the OECD. In addition, the OECD forecasts that economic growth in Australia will be well above the average for all member countries over the next two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a direct result of increased emphasis on micro-economic reform and government efforts to instil an export culture within industry, the Australian economy has become more international in outlook. Exports of goods and services rose by close to 70 per cent in real terms between 1984-85 and 1992-93. Manufactured exports were the star performers which more than doubled in real terms over the same eight-year period. Imports of goods and services in real terms grew by a more modest 42 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1980s and the early 1990s have been a period of major structural change for the manufacturing and service sectors of the Australian economy, as firms in the manufacturing, and more recently, the service sector have made an increased commitment to improving productivity. Strong employment growth in manufacturing and services suggests that the restructuring process may be complete in many industries. Optimism for sustained employment growth may therefore be warranted. Evidence of improving competitiveness is found in the continuing strong growth in manufactured and services exports. Manufactured exports have grown at an annual average of 9.2 per cent in the period 1985-86 to 1992-93, while services exports have recorded 8.6 per cent annual growth over the same period. Furthermore, the strong export growth of these sectors has continued despite a weak world economy, and a recession in Australia's largest overseas customer&mdash;Japan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that even those purveyors of doom in the coalition recognise that Australia has entered a new period of growth, the issue that faces government is the management of that growth. The government recognises that, despite an improvement of 20 per cent in Australia's international competitiveness compared with 1989-90, there is still much to be done. Australia needs to maintain and increase its improved level of competitiveness to ensure that the balance of payments does not constrain growth. Australia has to continue to maintain the pace of micro-economic reform, and this means that the states must start to pull their weight. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is to be congratulated on his historic achievement last Friday in Hobart in gaining the support of the state premiers to establish the Australian Competitive Commission. State governments will no longer have unfettered power to protect their state monopolies in areas such as transport, electricity, gas and water from competition from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has also to raise its savings so that as investment grows we do not need to increasingly depend on the savings of other nations to fund our growth. The Commonwealth has set out its program of deficit reduction to reduce its impact on public dissaving, and this discipline needs to apply across the public sector. The private sector, too, needs to raise its level of savings to fund a new era of investment stimulated by stable asset values. The government is determined to maintain Australia's hard won low inflation status. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) reported earlier this month the consumer price index was forecast to grow by 3.5 per cent in the budget, but as a result of a 0.2 per cent figure for the December quarter, the Treasurer is anticipating an inflation figure for the year of 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is not resting on its laurels. Honourable members will be aware of the government's announced intentions to set new standards in lowering costs of business and government through micro-economic reform, regulatory reform, and innovation and competition policy. In 1994 we all understand that industry policy is not about detailed prescriptions for industry where the government directs the flow of resources to inefficient industries. Nor is it about further tariff and quota protection and sheltering industry from international market signals. Nor is it about subsidies to prop up uncompetitive firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government policy is set to create the environment for the development of innovative, flexible firms able to compete successfully in the international marketplace. The agreement reached on world trade through the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has greatly increased the potential for firms who can dynamically respond to new opportunities. While the agreement reached on world trade is a major breakthrough, much remains to ensure that the outcomes are translated into tangible benefits, particularly in our region. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) has indicated the high priority he places, together with the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan), on breaking down impediments to the sale of Australian services and manufactured goods in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As markets open, success in the 1990s will increasingly be as a result of innovation, including productivity improvement and technological change.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International competitiveness depends less and less on traditional factors such as access to natural resources and cheap labour.

That requires a talented and adaptive work force capable of using the latest technologies and reaching ever-higher levels of productivity.</PARA>

The rise in innovative performance of Australian enterprises of all sizes&mdash;small, medium and large&mdash;is the best indicator of our improved economic prospects not only for economic growth but also for employment growth. Never again will we let the dead hand of regulation, protectionism and fear of change stifle the innovative spirit of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to make a few remarks about regional development. This government has recognised the critical need for a fresh and reinvigorated look at regional Australia and the contribution every region can make to national development. As the Prime Minister said in June 1993, this government wants to pull the regions of Australia into the national grid. It is not about parochialism, it is about partnership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, the government established the task force on regional development. It had the Industry Commission conduct an inquiry into impediments to regional industry adjustment and has engaged McKinsey and Co. to conduct a major study on business investment in regional Australia. Each one of these will provide a valuable input into the government's policy making process and provide a basis for establishing a framework to further advance the government's commitment. The report of the task force on regional development, called `Developing Australia', outlines a vision for this nation over a 30-year time frame and illustrates Australia's enormous and still relatively untapped economic potential. The report contains a check list of major infrastructure projects that would be of enormous benefit to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my consultations with regional communities&mdash;this was also the experience of the regional task force&mdash;I have found that in the many and diverse parts of Australia there are many people who have a strong desire to make their community fully participate in Australia's development. A key role of this government will be to tap into that desire and harness it, not only for the benefit of the regions but for the benefit of the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere will the government's increased emphasis on regional development be more important than for northern Australia. While encompassing almost 50 per cent of Australia's land mass, but with only 5.4 per cent of the population, northern Australia nevertheless accounts for about 28 per cent of our exports. The growth prospects for minerals and hydrocarbon, tourism and agriculture are very promising, but the rapid growth has placed pressure on the provision of infrastructure and has also led to social problems. In this context, I was pleased to be able to announce last week the grant of $250,000 of Commonwealth funds to establish a northern Australia social research institute, which is a collaborative effort between the James Cook University of North Queensland, the University of the Northern Territory and Hedland College in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much misunderstanding of the development potential of the north. It is worth while to reflect just for a moment on the development of Ord River, for it illustrates many lessons of northern development. The development of irrigated pastures for the Ord and Fitzroy rivers was a dream of the Durack family dating back to the turn of the century. Honourable members will recall Mary Durack's book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kings in Grass Houses</EMPHASIS>, about life on a cattle station in the Kimberleys. In 1940 a Western Australian royal commission recommended the establishment of a research station in the Ord Valley. In 1941 a small experimental irrigation research farm was established. In 1945 CSIRO joined with the Western Australian department of agriculture in establishing a Kimberley research station. In 1967 a decision was made to proceed with the construction of the main Ord River dam, which resulted in the establishment of Lake Argyle, a reservoir with nine times the water of Sydney Harbour. The recent ASTEC report on research and technology in tropical Australia is most critical of the research and development undertaken at the Ord. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even when the dam was opened in 1972 research data on suitable crop regimes was unavailable or incomplete, and pest problems were unresolved.</PARA>
<PARA>The main focus of research at the Ord had been directed at cotton and, despite the incomplete research base, commercial production was attempted. The result was a disaster that is so well cited in fashionable southern circles, government and academic. What is not so well known is that, following the abandonment of cotton in 1974, the growers slowly and with much effort and hard work began to develop new crops, many of which were not considered seriously at all in previous decades. As a result, the value of agricultural production from the Ord has steadily climbed from approximately $9 million in 1985-86 to about $32 million in 1991-92. Subsidies for production ceased in the mid-1980s and commercial agriculture is sufficiently progressed now for the Western Australian government to move to full cost recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heritage of 50 years of research effort into the crop production in the Ord Valley has resulted in the development of a sophisticated and well educated grower community, many of whom are ex-research staff with higher degrees. Their skills enable a wide range of crops to be grown, including bananas, rockmelons, watermelons, hybrid seeds, maize, sorghum and beans. Despite the hopes, the aspirations and the plans for the Ord over 100 years and the substantial progress in recent years, development of the region remains well short of its potential. Presently, less than 10 per cent of a possible 75,000 hectares is under irrigation in the Ord River irrigation area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of agricultural production at the Ord is now on the brink of major expansion. For a number of years the Ord River District Cooperative, in conjunction with the engineering design firm Schultz, Tait and Greig, have undertaken considerable original research on the milling of sugar on the appropriate scale for establishing the industry at the Ord. This research has been extensively evaluated by the Sugar Research Institute and CSR Ltd. I am pleased to be able to announce that the tax concession committee of the Industrial Research and Development Board decided on 3 February 1994 that development work undertaken was innovative research, eligible for the 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ord River District Cooperative has developed a proposal to build a sugar mill to process 560,000 tonnes of cane per annum. At current market prices the value of this production would be about $25 million&mdash;a small fraction of the total Australian production of $1.4 billion, but nevertheless very significant to the economic prosperity of this region. Honourable members will be aware of the importance of the sugar industry in establishing the thriving cities and towns of coastal North Queensland. I understand that CSR has had initial discussions with the Ord River Development Commission regarding the possibility of establishing a sugar industry in the Ord and that those discussions are continuing under a memorandum of understanding between the parties. These developments represent more progress on the establishment of a sugar industry in the Ord than has ever occurred in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as sugar, intensive cattle fattening on leucaena pastures holds much promise for further development. The cattle fattening industry is critically dependent on the growth of the live cattle trade with South-East Asia, which is booming through the port of Darwin. The prospects are very favourable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Ord River development is an important case study of the development of the north. I would like to provide honourable members very quickly with an impression of the magnitude of the developments occurring in the north. Oil and particularly gas have been a major area of investment in the North West Shelf of Western Australia. All Australians would be aware of the massive capital investment of close to $10 billion in infrastructure to establish the Woodside liquid natural gas</PARA>
<PARA>facility and associated gas pipelines. From 1995, when additional production comes on line, LNG and condensate sales from Woodside's facility will be worth an estimated $2 billion per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Iron ore production in the Pilbara is worth in excess of $2.7 billion annually. Western Australian governments have been interested in encouraging its further processing. The availability of gas and the development of new iron ore processing technology, such as the direct reduced iron, offer new hopes for further processing. Such developments are best fostered not by governments establishing special plans and programs but by ensuring the free and open operation of markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of Darwin also would be considerably enhanced through the availability of a long-term supply of gas and low cost power. The area around Darwin has long been held to be prospective for oil and gas but drilling, unfortunately, to date has been very disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk from some high profile members of the mining community about Mabo and the supposed impediment it poses to mining development. Let me say it simply: Mabo is not anti mining development in Australia. But, equally, Mabo does not permit any mining company to ride roughshod over the rights of any Australians, whatever colour they may be. On 11 April this year I will be attending the opening of the Mount Todd goldmine just east of Katherine in the Northern Territory. This mine will cost over $140 million to establish. It will produce over 150,000 ounces of gold per year, worth $80 million in current gold prices. There are sufficient reserves there for 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that not only in northern Australia but all over Australia the evidence is clear: Australia is entering a new and historically important era of growth. The agreement the Prime Minister has achieved with the states at the Council of Australian Governments meeting will provide a major stimulus for sustained growth. Government business monopolies produce only 10 per cent of the nation's output from 19 per cent of the nation's capital stock. Competition will bring about lower prices, better service and increased product and service innovation. This government has tackled the legacy of an uncompetitive traded goods sector left to it by the Liberal and National parties. It has now set course for an efficient non-traded goods sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with interest to the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Lindsay). The honourable member is obviously a great optimist, and I am sure his knowledge of northern Australia is very important knowledge to impart to all of us. I found myself agreeing with a lot of what he said in the sense that regional development is now on the agenda, thank goodness. It is on the agenda for all political parties in this federal parliament, as it should have been many years ago but, regrettably, was not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appropriation bills about which I am speaking, Appropriation Bill (No. 3), Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), are a lead-up to the full formal budget, which is to be delivered by the government before 30 June and which will be an historic occasion. The point is that in this debate we can signal in a broad way some of the areas that we believe need addressing and some of the areas that need to be given great priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view, regional development is absolutely fundamental to the future of Australia. If we do it properly, we can expect to reap a very good harvest. If we just pay it lip-service and do not make the decisions that we should with respect to strategic policies, then regional development will not prosper as it should and Australia will not fulfil its full identity as a robust nation, based on a federation which maximises the contribution of city and country people and which recognises that city and country people are a partnership and cannot exist independently of each other; they rely on each other. My view of the future of Australia is that we will increasingly rely on each other as we go into the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bodies such as the Association of Development Executives Victoria, which is a professional association of personnel involved in economic development in Victoria, often speak to me. They have recently made a submission to the federal government in response to the task force recommendations. I recommend that any members who are interested in regional development should spend as much time as possible talking to the practitioners and the people out in the regions, such as the members of the Association of Development Executives Victoria, before they make a final decision as to the model that will be adopted to deliver regional coordination, management and policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us, and I think it is fair to include the Association of Development Executives Victoria, fear that there may be another bureaucracy established by the present government with respect to its proposed regional development policies. We already have far too much bureaucracy. We have different spheres of local, state and federal government and we have associations of regional bodies throughout Australia. I understand that the broad proposals of the federal government are looking at some model of regional management and coordination. So it will be a great challenge to determine how to sort that out and how to deliver a model that will not create another bureaucracy and that will not use the strengths of existing bureaucratic structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I would like to make is that we are not achieving the full potential of regions in Australia because of the regressive tax system that we have. I give one example of how tax is adversely affecting Australia's future and retarding regional development. I refer to the states payroll tax, the infamous tax on employment. We are a nation which, unfortunately, has one million unemployed people, and most of those are young Australians. We also have an ever increasing number of unemployed Australians who are 40 years and over. We allow each state in Australia to provide an ever increasing amount of its annual revenue requirements by taxing jobs; that is, by allowing payroll tax to be levied on companies and small businesses. Each job that is created faces an increase in payout of payroll tax. Victoria receives in the vicinity of $7 billion a year from payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of payroll tax is fairly well known. It arose during the time of the Second World War. It was regarded as a temporary measure and, unfortunately, it has become enshrined in the system. It is true to say that, if we waved a magic wand and took away the payroll tax revenue from each state in Australia overnight, they would be in severe financial crisis. They rely on this money now. They cannot do away with it, unless the funds are replaced by some other measure. I regard that as one of the major strategic policies that has to be addressed with respect to Australia's future and particularly with respect to regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was a member of the Victorian government and the Victorian parliament, we had policies that gave exemptions from payroll tax for new, approved industries established in decentralised locations in the state. That model worked for a long while and certainly helped to create new investment and jobs in regional Victoria. But, after a while, because it was a blank cheque, so to speak, it was not as effective as it should have been because once granted it continued. It was not seen so much as an incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, there have been proposals that payroll tax exemptions should be reintroduced in Victoria, but for fixed periods, such as five or seven years. This is so the companies and businesses that are set up know where they stand. They are given relief from payroll tax for a period of years and then, after that, they go back to being normal taxpayers, paying the same rates of payroll tax as every other unfortunate victim. Somewhere between those two poles is the area we ought to go to. But I would certainly prefer to see the federal government, in conjunction with the states and local government and with business and industry, examining the ways and means&mdash;and there are ways and means, which I will not spell out here now&mdash;to eliminate payroll tax totally. If the most regressive tax on employment were done away with, we would be a far better nation and we would be able to get on and create more jobs, particularly to help the unfortunate unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member from regional Australia in north-east Victoria, I know that the tyranny of distance is always a problem. I get increasingly disappointed with the fact that almost every budget, state and federal, takes a greater bite out of people's revenue, investments, capital and personal income in the form of fuel excise and fuel tax. For country people, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Fitzgibbon, would know, the tyranny of distance is a great problem. If we want to attract industry and small business or increase farming activity, which we must do on this continent, how can we continue to ask people to take the risks to invest and to work harder than they do now? Goodness me, most of them work pretty hard now. Why should we ask them to do this when we will penalise them in the area that hurts them most; that is, in the transport area? We have to get our products to the seaboard. We have to get our products to the factories for value adding. We have to deliver them to the major markets. People living in regional Australia spend almost every minute of the day looking around and seeing that they are being penalised through the fuel excise and fuel taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly disappointed to see in the first budget that I witnessed in this place since I was elected that fuel excise increase by 2c a litre for leaded and 1c a litre for unleaded, with another 1c to come in August this year. It is true to say that the petrol pump in Australia is an active and very hungry branch of the Australian Taxation Office. I fear that, unless something drastic is done, it will get worse and not better. If the fuel excise were being used to pay for roads, then we could perhaps argue that it is a form of toll and therefore that it is worth maintaining in some form or other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the House some figures. In 1983-84, 10 years ago, the fuel excise revenue of the Commonwealth was $1.8 billion, which is equal to four per cent of the total tax revenue at that time. Ten years later, in 1993-94, fuel excise is estimated to reap $8.3 billion, 800 per cent more, which is equal to 8.9 per cent of total tax revenue. So the total tax revenue for the Commonwealth has more than doubled in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal government spending on roads, of course, has not kept up with that dramatic increase in the revenue take for fuel tax. For example, 10 years ago in the 1983-84 budget, federal spending on roads amounted to $1.2 billion while the fuel tax generated $1.8 million. So, out of each dollar collected in fuel excise 10 years ago, 66c was being spent on roads. In 1993-94, 10 years later, $1 billion is allocated by the federal government to be spent on roads in Australia, while the fuel tax collected will be $8.3 billion. Therefore, out of every dollar collected in fuel excise in 1993-94 only 12c is spent on roads. So in 10 years we have reduced the spending from 66c in the dollar to 12c in the dollar. </PARA>

But the problem is that the indirect taxes and charges such as the fuel tax, the payroll tax and the wholesale sales tax are taking an ever increasing bite and adding to the costs for everybody, particularly those that we are trying to encourage to make investments in business, in industry and, particularly from my point of view, in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have got a big problem and it is made worse because we now find in regional parts of Australia such as in my home territory, north-east Victoria, the actual cost of fuel at the retail petrol pump is many cents per litre more than in metropolitan Melbourne.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But not 15c a litre. It is well known and accepted that the approximate cost of transportation is about 1.2c per litre from Melbourne to Albury-Wodonga. So we have this incredible retail difference of 13c to 15c per litre for country people compared with metropolitan people. When companies are confronted with this they say that they are allowed to do their own marketing and discounting to handle competition in the major metropolitan areas and that is all it is. But there is clear evidence that this difference is being subsidised and paid for by people living in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the oil companies have not revealed the full facts and are hiding behind the fact that the wholesale prices are fixed by the rather antiquated system of the South Australian Prices Surveillance Authority and that retail prices are allowed to fluctuate in the free market. But it is not a free, open, fair market when we have consistently such a large difference in price for the same quantity of fuel, less the cost of freight, being sold 300 kilometres away, for example, in Melbourne compared with Wangaratta, Benalla or Wodonga. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that Medicare is supported by the coalition, let me put that quite plainly and unqualifiedly, despite attempts in the last federal election for our position to be misrepresented. But the problem with Medicare is that it needs surgery urgently and if it does not get that surgery we will find more people missing out on the treatment that all taxpayers want everyone to get. That is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waiting list for pain relieving surgery in Australia is enormous. Some honourable members would know this as they may have family and friends suffering pain because they cannot get an operation which is regarded as so-called elective surgery, not trauma surgery. Take the case of a child who has suffered trauma in a motor accident and needs surgery on the face followed by cosmetic surgery. I can tell honourable members that the initial surgery is available immediately, as it should be, following the accident but the cosmetic surgery&mdash;the skin grafts, et cetera&mdash;is delayed. Sometimes the operations are cancelled after the child has been admitted the night before the operation for the ongoing skin grafts. The operations are cancelled because of the problems with funding and the pressures on public hospitals. These are very real, serious problems. Elderly people needing hip replacements or other orthopaedic operations suffer similarly. I do not believe it is acceptable for us to allow this to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly note the public conflict between the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and Senator Richardson, the current Minister for Health, with respect to the ways in which we can help overcome this problem. One of the reasons for the problem, we all know, is that more and more people are dropping out of private health insurance for various reasons, mainly cost, and saying, `We are paying our Medicare levy, we may as well go to the public hospital to seek our treatment'. So we are finding that low income people, pensioners, aged and unemployed people, are in the same queues waiting for treatment at public hospitals as people&mdash;I call them, somewhat irreverently, those with the Toorak gall bladder&mdash;that have dropped out of private health insurance but are still able to take out insurance if given some form of incentive. That means that there is less money for the public hospitals to provide the treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter what our philosophical view is, commonsense should prevail. The Prime Minister, in my view, should pick up broadly Senator Richardson's recommendations that would restore some incentive to people to take out private health insurance or to maintain it, which of course has been a coalition policy for some years. That is an unresolved urgent issue. Whereas eight or 10 years ago something like 70 per cent of Australians took out some form of private health insurance as well as paying Medicare levies, that number is now down to 40 per cent. I predict that, unless something is done urgently, the number of people with private health insurance in Australia by next year will be less than 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means we will have more people looking for services in public hospitals. To provide the service we have to put huge amounts of extra money in. Where is that money going to come from? Is the government going to increase the Medicare levy from 1.4 per cent, a further imposition on families, business and everyone else? Or is it going to use its nous and do what it should, maximise the use of the private and public health systems of Australia so that they complement each other and achieve the reforms that we need?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Wednesday in this place when speaking on the appropriation bills, I made reference to a young man in my electorate called Paul Pisasale, who is an alderman on the Ipswich City Council and also the executive officer of a skillshare funded program called YUPI&mdash;young unemployed people of Ipswich. Paul has worked extremely hard with young people, particularly so in the last five years in which I have got to know him pretty well. Unfortunately, some 15 years ago, Paul, like a lot of young people who make mistakes, had a brush with the law. He went through the processes of law and has done his penance for that. Over the last 15 years, Paul has worked extremely hard with a lot of young people in helping them through their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Sadly, last Thursday a National Party member from Broadwater on the Gold Coast, Mr Grice, found it necessary to raise this issue in the parliament in Queensland to cause embarrassment to Paul, who is now the Labor Party mayoral candidate in the council elections due to be held on 26 March. Interestingly enough, under the Criminal Law (Rehabilitation of Offenders) Act 1986, which was introduced by the National Party in Queensland, it is questionable whether that act gives any person the opportunity to disclose after five years any offence somebody has committed. It is debatable whether by hiding behind what is often called coward's castle Mr Grice was in order doing that. That has now been raised with the Attorney-General in Queensland and he is seeking advice from the Crown Solicitor in Queensland on that. That is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the first time that things have been raised by the National Party in Queensland against Paul Pisasale. Mrs Di McCauley, the state member for Callide&mdash;another National Party member&mdash;did the same thing in October 1993. Given the National Party's horrific experience in Queensland over many years, National Party members should be the last people to attack other people for records like this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there has been a lot of problems in the Ipswich City Council over recent years due mainly to the Mayor of Ipswich, Dave Underwood, who was a member of the Labor Party. The party expelled him because of his poor behaviour and disrespect for the institution of the Australian Labor Party. He is now causing all sorts of problems for people by raising some of these issues. He has denied that he has given this information to any National Party people, but we can all draw our own conclusions about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party member for Callide in October 1993 alleged that Paul Pisasale was earning some $200,000 a year as a result of his involvement with YUPI under the skillshare program. That was absolute rubbish. I quote Mrs McCauley's words from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Queensland parliament:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An allegation has been made to me&mdash;and I have no way of checking it, which is why I am referring it to the Minister&mdash;that Alderman Pisasale, who is involved with a council youth training scheme called the Young Unemployed People of Ipswich&mdash;YUPI . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I have referred to that program. She had no ground for making her allegation. The allegation was again completely unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Alderman Underwood would know something about all these things that were going on. It is a fact that Paul Pisasale's unfortunate record&mdash;a mistake he made many years ago&mdash;was known to Alderman Underwood. Paul claims that he told Alderman Underwood himself. I certainly knew some years ago that Paul had made that mistake. He mentioned it to me when he first stood for the Ipswich City Council. He obviously told a lot of other people. It was a well-known fact. He often uses it when addressing young people in trying to help them along their way. He tells them that he made a mistake and encourages them not to make a similar mistake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 March, the people in the city of Ipswich have a very important decision to make. The Labor Party has provided very strong and thoughtful government for Ipswich over many years. A bunch of Independents, a mix of former Liberal-National Party people, are running. Alderman Underwood has lined himself up with those people. There is nothing worse than a Labor rat, I suppose, than someone who defects to another party. This bloke defected to the Liberal Party initially, but now he has decided to defect to the National Party. Even Billy Hughes knew where to draw the line when it came to that. Even he did not want to line up with the grubby National Party. The National Party in Queensland should stop lining itself up with Underwood and vice versa so that on this occasion the people of Ipswich can have a clear choice of what to do, and that is to support the Labor Party. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I want to follow on from some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) in the close of his address on the appropriation bills with regard to proposed health care reforms of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson. My electorate has one of Australia's leading orthopaedic surgeons Dr Bill Cumberland. I recently received some correspondence from him with regard to the proposed reforms that have been put out for discussion by the health minister. Dr Cumberland's letter to me states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I explained you, the problems which exist in the Private Sector of the Health Care System in Australia and are trying to be addressed by Senator Richardson are analogous to a malady of a patients limb and the treatment prescribed by "Dr Richardson" is an unnecessary amputation. The further danger in his prescribed treatment is that more proximal amputations may subsequently be required, where as to cure this malady the patient really only needs medication rather than radical surgery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Managed Care will put the dollar ahead of the patient in the Private Health System and it is this certainly to a large part which has ruined the Public Health System. Private Corporations are bound by their Shareholders to seek profits and under Managed Care it will be the quantity and quality of Health Care of the Private Patient which is sacrificed in order to maximise this profit.</PARA>
<PARA>I have had the pleasure of discussing Senator Richardson's proposed health care reforms with Dr Cumberland and it is pleasing to hear such an informed voice on the topic. I would therefore like to put on record some of the criticisms Dr Cumberland, the Australian Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons and I have found in this discussion paper. First&mdash;this is highlighted in the Australian Medical Association's issues paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Right problem, wrong answer!</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the discussion paper released by Senator Richardson is far too general. It is only a vague outline and gives little explanation as to how the reforms might work in practice. In contradiction of its name, this discussion paper has actually acted in many cases as an impediment to effective dialogue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very strong argument is also raised by the Australian Society of Orthopaedic Surgeons concerning the universality of Medicare. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has played this issue for all it is worth by arguing that Medicare is for everyone, whenever they need it&mdash;rich and poor, sick and well. However, if the Medicare system is so universal, then why is this principle contradicted within the discussion paper which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare was always intended to coexist with the private health system, not to replace it.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely this is an admission by the government, in its very own discussion paper, that Medicare is only partly universal, which is a contradiction in itself. The Prime Minister might take note of this because Senator Richardson's discussion paper continues on the same subject by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial estimates of the cost of Medicare assumed that at least 40% of Australians would maintain their private cover.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only does this further break down this government's myth that Medicare is universal, but where on earth did this figure of 40 per cent come from? When Medicare was originally introduced, 60 per cent of people had private health cover, so why did the government estimate that 40 per cent of the population would maintain cover? Why not 50 per cent? Why not 30 per cent? Without explanation in the report, this figure certainly does appear to be an out of the hat figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further confusions and anomalies arise in this discussion when we see the document say that capping of insurance rebates to a 25 per cent insurable gap, enforced by government regulation, has created an incentive to overservice. Such a statement is an admission that capped fees, with or without an insurable gap, is an incentive to overproduce. To try to logically follow this, I therefore cannot understand why these proposals advocate fee capping after previously admitting that this will lead to overservicing. Surely the logical conclusion is that co-payment by the patient is essential to prevent overservicing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious reason Senator Richardson has rejected this is that it is a political football. But the minister must do the right thing by the whole department and by the whole health industry and not fiddle the figures simply to buy votes. He must examine the co-payment principle as a viable alternative. He has done it with the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, he has rejected it with bulkbilling and he looks likely to reject it here as well. The minister must be consistent but also true to the genuine needs of the health industry and the general health of the population. The discussion paper put forward by Senator Richardson must not be treated too harshly because it is an area of reform that must take place. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The family has been quite a topic of conversation in this House recently. People from all parties are coming forward with suggestions as to the reasons why families throughout Australia are in crisis and offering their solutions to the problem. As a teacher in another life, one who taught in disadvantaged schools in several states, it is apparent to me that in order for society to maximise the future potential of all its children all government agencies must collectively respond to address the problem of resourcing programs for the development of our children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education is not the sole responsibility of the education departments, state or federal. There must be an interagency approach taken to ensure that the parents of children up to the age of eight and the children themselves are resourced properly and fully supported so that, as they enter the critical transition period in their education, from primary to secondary school, few of them are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, we have close on 20 per cent in this risk category and little is being done to solve this problem. The federal intervention strategy is to be commended, but unless it is supported more effectively by the states, we will not succeed. State education departments are still operating on a fiscal rather than a pastoral basis. The thought of another state department operating in an interagency cooperative spirit rarely occurs anywhere throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some schools throughout the state system have developed excellent programs which attempt to establish the strong foundation upon which the future of their community can be based. One such school is the Herdsmans Cove Primary School in Gagebrook in my electorate. Its innovative and visionary early intervention program, run superbly by Doreen Lutjens, a teacher at the school, and ably supported by the principal, Col Breward, and his great staff, is going a long way to ensuring that both parents and children are receiving a wide range of activities which will enable the children in this area to receive the best foundation possible for their future lives at school and beyond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state Liberal government in its wisdom and under the cloak of fiscal responsibility has now cut back moneys allocated to this innovative program.

For the third time, I wish to address the topic of the successful abduction from Australia of two Australian citizens, Iddin and Shah Gillespie, son and daughter respectively of Mrs Jacqueline Gillespie of Melbourne, by their natural father, Raja Bahrin Shah, a Malaysian prince. Much publicity has ensued on the subject since I first introduced it in the adjournment debate on 19 August 1992 and when I made lengthy comments on a set of appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department on 6 October 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The story has progressed through the extradition from Florida in the United States and arrest of Bryan Walter Wickham, a Perth construction worker, an accomplice used by the prince in the abduction.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this course of events, it became obvious that the prince had paid out a large amount of money to Wickham in order to facilitate the abduction. Details had been presented in court papers filed by US federal prosecutor Thomas O'Malley in Florida, together with amounts cashed for gold bullion to pay the Indonesian authorities. The total operation was estimated to cost $170,000; however, the lion's share definitely went to Wickham. </PARA>

According to the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 7 May 1993, Wickham `hung his head and wept in the dock' as his barrister pleaded leniency.

That association, which was started by Mary Paten with a small group of women friends in her garage in Victoria some 30 years ago, has expanded, grown and spread throughout Australia, offering enormous support and encouragement to women and their young children. It is perhaps fitting that the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia celebrates its birthday in the International Year of the Family because it too is focusing on the whole issue of nurturing, the bonding and the relationship between mother and child, family and children, and the development of that positive environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Nursing Mothers Association over time has fought a number of battles enabling women giving birth to have more knowledge, to be more independent and to be able to pursue less medically intrusive procedures, as well as pursuing the issue of breastfeeding for the health of the child and the mother. As an association it has made its mark on Australia, it has enriched the lives of the women it has touched, it has enabled all of us to be part of a more caring environment and community and has enabled children to be bonded over a longer period. </PARA>

This is a topic of vital concern to me, having in my own electorate one of the highest areas of unemployment in Victoria. I was interested to look at the research undertaken by the Challenge Bank in conjunction with the Curtin University of Technology's economic and financial research unit in Perth, Western Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it could alleviate long-term unemployment more quickly by introducing Job Compact, an agreement or contract between the long-term unemployed and the Federal Government. Job Compact emphasised reciprocal obligation for both parties to the agreement.</PARA>

They read with dismay that the government was providing a job under the job compact for only between six and nine months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question relates to the years in which compulsory bicycle helmet wearing was being introduced by each State and Territory government. The detailed data needed to assess bicyclist injury patterns has not yet been assembled for either of those years. It is known, however, that nationally the total number of bicyclists seriously injured or killed has decreased dramatically since bicycle helmets were made compulsory. For example there were 80 bicyclists killed in 1990, but this figure was 58 in 1991, 41 in 1992 and 44 in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only nationally consistent source of information on the injuries received by those killed in road crashes is the Federal Office of Road Safety's `Fatality File' database which is collected every two years. This database incorporates data from a number of sources, including State Coroners, and as a result there is a considerable lag before the source data can be accessed. While the 1992 database is currently being collected, the most recent data available at present relates to 1990. The 1990 data provides a general guide to the potential benefits to be obtained from subsequent legislation for compulsory helmet wearing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The UK Government has a position of non-indexation of pension outside the UK except where the indexation is covered specifically in an agreement. The Australian Agreement does not include this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government believes non-indexation of British pensions in Australia is unjust. As British pensions are contribution based, a lower rate of pension should not be paid to some pensioners just because they choose to live in a particular country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear whether the question was meant to cover bone densitometry testing rather than mammography as the latter is used to detect breast cancer and not osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only potential link between osteoporosis and mammography is if a woman being treated for osteoporosis by Hormone Replacement Therapy is considered to have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's funding arrangements for mammography recognise the dual use of mammography in screening and in diagnosis of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For mammography screening, special purpose grants have been made to the States and Territories which aim to ensure the provision on a national basis of a network of accredited screening and assessment facilities. These services are provided at no cost to the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure of the screening program was based on the recommendations of the Screening Evaluation Co-Ordination unit established to evaluate the effectiveness of mammography screening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For diagnostic mammography, Medicare benefits are available where a woman presents to her doctor with symptoms or indications of malignancy in the breast, or with a family history of breast cancer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, if a doctor considers that a patient has symptoms, indications or a family history of breast cancer, Medicare benefits are available for mammography.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the potential link between osteoporosis and mammography HRT is only one of a number of therapies used in the treatment of osteoporosis and its associated fractures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence of the effectiveness of long-term HRT in preventing fractures is inconclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the issue of an increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT is the subject of considerable controversy among the scientific and medical community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No clear consensus has been reached concerning the existence or magnitude of any increased risk of developing breast cancer in women receiving HRT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is to convene a consensus conference on the use of HRT. This should enable consensus to be reached on the implications of HRT for breast cancer risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interim it is a matter for the individual clinician to determine whether he or she believes his patient is at risk of breast cancer based on clinical indications, and if so to order a mammogram.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mammography is, however, unable to indicate osteoporosis per se and it is of no use in monitoring that condition. Rather bone densitometry which measures bone density is considered to have a place in dealing with osteoporosis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 March 1994, Medicare benefits at a schedule fee of $75 per service will be available bone densitometry testing in certain specified circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expert advice on specification and implementation of Medicare Benefits for bone densitometry was sought last year from the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee (MBAC).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has accepted all of the recommendations of MBAC on the provision of Medicare Benefits for certain bone densitometry tests including a series of measures to promote quality and appropriate use of the technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">MBAC recommended that payment of benefits should be confined to two clinical applications, based on a review of current scientific knowledge and clinical practice. These are, firstly, in the confirmation and monitoring of established osteoporosis and secondly, in the diagnosis and monitoring of bone loss associated with a specific set of clinical conditions. These include chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis and proven malapsorptive disorders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the use of bone densitometry as a screening tool to detect developing osteoporosis amongst menopausal women, MBAC concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to warrant the payment of Medicare benefits for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, women who are receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or other treatments, for osteoporosis will be eligible for Medicare benefits for bone densitometry as part of the monitoring of their condition.</PARA>
