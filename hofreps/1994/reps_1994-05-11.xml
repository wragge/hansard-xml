<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on the Financial Agreement Bill and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill has been rather long coming. The bills are not profoundly important but, as I remind the House, they do update the financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. The principal provisions of the bills will abolish the restriction on the states borrowing in their own name; remove the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the states; remove the need for future borrowing by the Commonwealth or</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the states to be approved under the agreement between the Commonwealth and the states; and, I am glad to say, admit the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory as signatories to the financial agreement between the Commonwealth, states and territories. These are all updating measures that bring into line with current practice the statutory framework for the financial agreement between the states and the territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic in a way that we are debating these bills the day after the budget was brought down because they are to do with one of the important elements of financial arrangements. I want to touch on one issue directly related to the subject of the bills, that is, the level of government debt in Australia. One of the facts that are least well known about the Australian economy is that we have very little national debt. In fact, the Commonwealth, the states and the local governments combined have less debt as a proportion of national income than do other Western countries. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a graph which demonstrates that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The graph read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>[GRAPH OMITTED FROM DATABASE - SEE HARD COPY PAGE 609]</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KG4">Mr LANGMORE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This graph was taken from the figures published in the June 1993 Economic Outlook of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. It shows that Australia has less debt as a proportion of national income than any other Western country. The graph shows that government debt&mdash;the debt of all governments of Australia&mdash;as a proportion of national income was only 35 per cent in 1993. That is the lowest figure amongst the countries with which we usually compare ourselves. For example, Germany's total debt as a proportion of its GDP was 45 per cent; the United Kingdom, 47 per cent; the United States, 64 per cent&mdash;almost twice as large as Australia; Japan, about 65 per cent; Canada, 86 per cent or close to three times the figure in Australia, and some would say that Canada is the country with which we can most directly compare ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several points on this. First of all, it is essential that we know of that fact: people are oppressed by Australia's level of overseas debt. That is a problem for us. It makes our exchange rates and current account more vulnerable, and we have to be concerned about that. That is why it is very valuable that our manufactured exports have been growing so strongly. But, quite often, particularly members of the opposition remark that the government should not be running a deficit. It is asserted that that builds up debt and creates problems for us in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make the point that, at a time of high unemployment, it is entirely responsible for the government to borrow in order to invest in infrastructure that will be productive in the future, that will increase the efficiency of the economy, that will improve private sector productivity and that will directly contribute to growth of employment; and that we can afford to do that because our debt is so low. Of course, we do not want to run deficits any longer than we need. The government plans, of course, as was announced here last night, to substantially reduce that deficit as the recovery occurs. But at a time when unemployment is still over 10 per cent it is entirely responsible to borrow&mdash;in fact, it would be irresponsible not to borrow&mdash;in order to invest, in order to stimulate economic growth and growth of employment. We are very fortunate to have the capacity to do that. It is essential that we recognise this central fact of our economic life and build that into our consideration of appropriate economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other dimension of this is that the figures I have been quoting are the debts of the Commonwealth and the states combined. The fact of the matter is that the states also have relatively low debt. This is not at all well known. In Victoria, the Kennett government has been projecting a sense of crisis and emergency because, it asserts, Victoria has high debts. In fact, Victoria has very low debts by international standards. Victoria's estimated debt in 1992-93 was 31.3 per cent of gross state product. There is not one OECD country that has a debt as low as that as a proportion of its national product. It is legitimate to make that kind of comparison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that several of the states have even lower debts still. New South Wales, for example, has a net debt of 16 per cent of its gross state product; Queensland, about seven per cent; Western Australia, about 21 per cent; South Australia, 26 per cent; Tasmania, 45 per cent, far above Victoria; and the Northern Territory, 32 per cent, which is about the same as Victoria. So it is true that Victoria is at the higher end of state debt. It is also true that any level of debt involves debt servicing payments, which are a drain on outlays. One does not want any government to have any more debt servicing than it can possibly avoid, but it is important to get this level of debt into accurate perspective. That is what has been completely lacking in the Victorian debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another way of showing the situation in Victoria is that in 1992 its debt per capita was about $7,000. That is less than the level of per capita debt, in comparable price terms, at the beginning of the 1970s. Between the war and the mid-1970s Victoria's debts came down, but even now they are no higher than they were in the early 1970s. So Victoria does not have a debt crisis. It is important that Victorians know the facts about their own financial situation and not believe the misrepresentations that the Kennett government is trying to force on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the central points I want to make about this bill. This bill does increase the maturity of Commonwealth-state financial relations, but that is happening at a time when Australia's government finances are in an extremely strong state. We should remember that when we are considering the budget because the budget itself is a particularly economically responsible financial document and is built on an entirely sound basis. That means that it is very well judged, in my view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Financial Agreement Bill 1994 and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994. The sinking fund really draws into the mind of the Australian community, I guarantee, a description of the current government's management of the economy, the whole economy being part of a sinking fund presided over by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We have come through the worst recession Australia has had since the Depression, and at great cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sinking fund, in the terms we are debating it today, is about debt and the way Australia manages its debt. I disagree completely with the propositions of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), in regard to the state of the Australian economy&mdash;as he would expect. The fact is that Australia has a debt larger than that of any comparable country in the world and he is saying that we can manage that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look at South American countries and say that they are banana republics. What prophetic words they were from the present Prime Minister when he said that we would become a banana republic. We are a banana republic, if we look at our national debt and the way we have managed it. We have gained nothing from that national debt. The point you make is that we should have gained something from it; we have gained nothing from it. The infrastructure you so sorely want, that you crave for&mdash;the works programs, the big projects that you think will employ people and encourage Australian skills&mdash;has been lost, and your government lost it. I did not hear you crying out, `Change direction!'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that that voice was not raised. It is passionately raised now when we are looking at the size of deficits and the amount of money borrowed. What an opportunity we have had over a 10-year period, but you borrowed all that dough and frittered it away. More crude terms for what we have done with that opportunity are used in hotels, but it is a proper description of what has happened to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we analyse the debt structure of the states, local government and the Commonwealth we can see that little has been done except to retain the position of Paul Keating, both as Treasurer, with his ambitions to succeed Bob Hawke, and then as Prime Minister. That is what has driven the Labor Party. That is what has driven many people on the opposite side&mdash;not the well-being of the Australian community and the fact that they ought to know what a hire purchase agreement can do to any family if they overcommit themselves. The government is prepared and has been prepared to overcommit the Australian people and then, in order to resolve the problem, do what it did in the budget last week: sell the farm off, start getting rid of the assets. Well, there are not too many assets left to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foreign capital is being invested in Australia. An attractive climate for investment is being consciously fostered in order to have investment of any sort made&mdash;not selective investment. Any investment in Australia is good investment; it helps to balance the budget. It helps to make the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Prime Minister look good. That is what the debt management of Australia has been about. There has been no gain, no purpose for it. If we borrow money, we need to have a purpose, an objective, for it&mdash;to put on an addition to the home, to build a new factory or to improve pastures. Australians have seen no objective, no purpose, in the huge debts that the government and Australia, as a nation, have run up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proposing a changed relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in the way in which debt is managed. I am indebted to the Department of the Parliamentary Library for a quite erudite expression and explanation of the historic progress of financial agreements between the Commonwealth and the states, starting in 1927 and moving forward to this day. We have fluctuated in the way in which we have looked at the relationship between the Commonwealth and states in relation to the various powers, the Commonwealth borrowing powers, to borrow globally for the nation, and the way in which we have distributed to the states their preferences as far as the amount of money that has been borrowed is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal process is through the Australian Loan Council. It says how much the states may borrow and then borrows it for them. That has been the practice, except in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Prime Minister of the day, Malcolm Fraser, said, `Why don't we take the shackles off the states and make them a bit more responsible? Why don't we let them borrow what they need to borrow?' We can imagine the sort of response that we would have received from the then opposition and the current Prime Minister about fostering a sense of responsibility in the management of state governments. We can imagine what support rational and thoughtful economic management would have brought from the then opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad to say that any rational consideration of what was done by the Fraser government was rejected by the current Prime Minister. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 15 May 1985 records the summary of what the current Prime Minister, the then Treasurer, felt was wrong with the Fraser government's attitude of encouraging states to be responsible. What Fraser said was that, if states go out on the market and borrow more than they can afford, they will wear the penalty. Australia has had two notorious examples of that&mdash;the Victorian government and the Western Australian government. The Victorian government could not carry on its programs, let alone carry them out, because of its overborrowings and its poor management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Fraser saw this and said, `Let us make these guys responsible for the money they borrow and the way in which they repay it. Why should the Commonwealth tell them how much they should borrow, raise the loans and then see that the funds are properly repaid by state governments?' So that was a step to a competitive federalism where good management is rewarded, which I and my colleague the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I tell those people in the gallery that the honourable member for Pearce comes from a state where good management has been put in place&mdash;Western Australia. It is salutary to see a change in attitude in that state and good sense, a sense of responsibility, drive and integrity for once. What a change! The person who was heading that state is now a minister in the Commonwealth government. The government has added a gem to the crown of financial management; it really has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial management that Fraser wanted to encourage amongst the states was for the states to carry full responsibility for their decisions&mdash;a system of competitive federalism. In 1985, Treasurer Keating said of that approach:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a cowardly way, the previous Government gave the States the borrowing approval to raise the necessary loans. That is the story of the Fraser years. That is the story of fiscal management during the Fraser years. </PARA>
<PARA>I could read page after page of what the Prime Minister thought about giving the states some freedom to manage their own affairs and borrow the money they needed from overseas or within Australia. Fraser clearly said, `If you guys as state premiers and state governments are going to overborrow, you're going to run your state into hard times and you'll be seen by your people as having done so.' But the Prime Minister condemns that. On 21 August 1985 he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who let the States out of Loan Council control, the big electricity instrumentalities and the large State authorities' borrowing programs? Who let the rabbit out of the bag? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I assume at that time that was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and Mr Fraser let it out of the bag. With a global limit we have got it back in and we have tried to get some discipline in borrowings, which we have been able to effect in the last two years. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is to blame for the blow-out in the public sector borrowing requirement when he had his mad railway program, his mad coal loader program, and every other mad thing he had when Malcolm Fraser decided that he would play Santa Claus to the States.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Prime Minister's opinion, yet today we are passing legislation that reverts exactly to what Fraser did. It wipes out the Commonwealth's responsibility to control state borrowings. Ten years have been wasted. That is the story of the Labor Party. You guys must be the slowest learners in the world. They bring in an ex-premier of Western Australia who was part of a cabinet that wrecked the finances of that state and promote her as though she will be the next Prime Minister. In 1985 the Prime Minister condemned the fiscal responsibility that had been placed on state governments, but nine years later he is prepared to restore that responsibility. We wonder why we have this massive overseas debt. It is because the debt has been irresponsibly managed by the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has only to look at the budget papers to understand where the funds have gone. A greater proportion of finances to state governments has been tied and a greater proportion of borrowings approved for specific purpose grants than there has been freedom of general purpose grants. The specific purpose grants have risen from 34 per cent to 41 per cent. If one looks at page 11 of last year's Budget Paper No. 3, entitled `Commonwealth financial relations with other levels of government 1993-94', one can easily assess the Commonwealth payments to the states and the way in which the Commonwealth has bled the states of direct finances so that it can use the huge amount of money it had borrowed itself. Page 71 refers to the borrowings program that was approved by the Loan Council for its replacement, the gentleman's agreements and all of those other arrangements having gone by the board. The Loan Council borrowings were reformed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the Loan Council came to a new agreement, a reform, that served three main purposes. Firstly, the new arrangements were to take account of practices that extended states borrowings and the imaginative application of those borrowing capacities and would allow closer monitoring of jurisdictional borrowings practices by other jurisdictions without the need for Loan Council approval. Secondly, per capita requirements were considered to be poor indicators of the jurisdiction's overall debt position. Thirdly, there was a requirement for provision of detailed information concerning jurisdictional net debt positions to the Loan Council. That was the 1992 position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 the Loan Council reconfirmed its commitment made in 1992-93 to abolish the restriction on the states to borrow in their own name; remove the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the states; remove the need for future borrowings by the Commonwealth or states to be approved under the agreement; admit the ACT and the Northern Territory as signatories to the agreement; and replace the existing agreement with new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has resulted in this legislation. The sinking fund has gone and we have the establishment of a new arrangement, the Financial Agreement Bill. The process has taken about four years, with high interest rates, hard management for state governments and with the Commonwealth clawing back its budget with no real sense of responsibility, just dragging money out of the states to its own advantage. Then, finally, the light dawns: `It gets so hard we have to make the states responsible.' Ten years have been lost. Once more the states are to be responsible for their own borrowings. If they blow it, the people of that state will count the state government responsible for blowing their budgets. That is a brilliant learning curve! It has taken the Commonwealth government 10 years to learn that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the borrowing programs over the last five years of the states and the Commonwealth. I refer to the 1993-94 budget paper No.3, page 71, headed `Global New Money Borrowings by Commonwealth and State Semi-Government and Local Authorities'. If one looks at New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and the Commonwealth, one sees that there has been a pretty consistent and responsible attitude by the New South Wales government on borrowings over the period. We see a doubling in Victoria's global borrowings in a period of two years and even beyond that from $1,100 million to $3,100 million, a threefold increase in a period of four years. It is no wonder Victoria was in trouble; it increased its global borrowings by threefold over that period. I remind the House that that was in a period of high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia it was not so severe. Its borrowings  increased by about 50 per cent over the same period. The Commonwealth's global borrowings clearly show the impact of the domestic deficit. The 1993-94 global borrowings total for the Commonwealth was $18,000 million, which includes the debt for the first time being brought into the global figures. As percentages of gross domestic product, the states' borrowings have increased, except for New South Wales. Victoria has doubled its borrowings, as one would expect. The total for Australia has massively increased, with the Commonwealth jumping from 0.4 per cent to 4.3 per cent as a total figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all indicates poor management. So we have here today the sinking fund being abolished, the Commonwealth government saying that state governments are going to be responsible once more, the Prime Minister saying over a period of some years as Treasurer that it is irresponsible for the states to be given the opportunity to enter into borrowings in their own name but, having now decided that days are so desperate, that they must be given the right to borrow in their own name. I believe that is the story of this government. The Labor Party and the Australian people to some degree have been greatly misled by the Prime Minister with his loud-sounding, high flown phrases which indicate that he does not understand that the Commonwealth must take responsibility for these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So after 10 years the states will now be responsible for their own borrowings. On 9 November 1988, Treasurer Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 of the bill is intended to make it a condition of the payment of general revenue grants to the states that all states should adhere to the global borrowing limits agreed to at the May Loan Council meeting by all states except Queensland. The Treasurer may reduce grants to any state exceeding those limits.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the strong hand, there is the whip to make states adhere to what the Commonwealth wanted to do. A few years later the government is throwing all of that out and saying, `That does not apply any more. We will let the states borrow in their own name. We will take the Loan Council responsibility out of the whole show.' The then Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment expands on the definition of `new borrowing' given in clause 3 . . . which . . . exclude any borrowings from the Commonwealth and include only borrowings that were the subject of the global approach resolution agreed to at the May Loan Council meeting by all States except Queensland, other than borrowings for refinancing purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>One can only conclude this debate by saying that the Commonwealth government has been derelict in its management of borrowed money. It has been careful to borrow as much as it can and has forced as much downstream as it can on the states. That has been done purely for the political purpose of making things look good for the Commonwealth government. There has been no gain. The Commonwealth cannot name a single major project, program, innovation or social change that has cost the amount of money that has been borrowed by it. It has been purely for the maintenance of government and for programs that make the government look good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is shameful that Australia has wasted so much time and will be held accountable in the long run to repay the money that has been borrowed. Australian people need something to show that their government is accountable, that their government is predictable in the way in which it approaches its problem and that ability and integrity, both in state governments and in the federal government, is rewarded. Too often we have seen states that have frittered away their funds rewarded by more grants or by a greater loan capacity. We need to see those that fritter away their resources and put people into unpayable debt penalised rather than encouraged. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to sum up on the Financial Agreement Bill and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill, which have been debated first of all yesterday afternoon and now today. I thank the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) for their contributions to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are important matters. They are a continuation of the evolutionary process of federal-state relations and a reflection of agreements that have been reached after quite detailed discussion by the Loan Council and, more recently, the Council of Australian Governments, with the agreement that was reached in February this year. Because of the contributions the honourable member for Mitchell made in the debate, people could be excused from thinking the bills do not reflect the change and the strategy that has been adopted of accountability, more scrutiny and transparency. That is precisely what these provisions and changes will mean. That is one of the fundamental consequences of the change to the introduction of the Financial Agreement Bill and the change from past practice in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far from this being an exercise that could be construed as providing less scrutiny as far as state finances or borrowings are concerned, the very opposite will be true. It will put more onus and scrutiny on the states and, at the same time, it will bring into reflection the current day needs as far as federal-state programs and federal-state relations are concerned. I think the agreement signed in February is one that should be welcomed and passed through this parliament. As has been said already, it needs complementary legislation in each of the states for it to come into effect. I am sure that, based on the discussions that have been held to date, that will be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal-state relations bring in all sorts of issues, and that is the way the debate inevitably went&mdash;far beyond the provisions of the two bills. If we look at the period since 1901 in relation to the way federalism and programs have moved in that time, of course there have been changes. But when the constitution was drafted, the powers were drafted in a way that gave certain specified powers to the Commonwealth. Residual powers and a range of concurrent powers remained with the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the founding fathers of the constitution understood that there would be evolution in those arrangements. I do not think it should be assumed that they were all just concerned about incremental federalism. I think there was an acknowledgment that changes would evolve over time, and that is precisely what has occurred. The honourable member for Curtin referred to the changes in general purpose grants to the states. The fact is that under the current arrangements there are real term guarantees in relation to general purpose grants to the states. I think the most recent agreement was generally viewed as satisfactory as far as the states were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the mid-1970s there have been general purpose grants with real terms guarantees to local government as well. So these are trends that have occurred over that time. The Whitlam government introduced those measures. Pleasingly, they have been continued by government since that time. They have become an important part of the funding arrangements at that level as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we compare the range of programs that governments provide these days with what was provided by government in 1901 or 1927, when the changed Loan Council arrangements came into effect, of course things have moved dramatically since then. We have assumed much more of a national identity than we had at that time. This is reflected in the types of programs that are adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Curtin made the comment that in relation to education and schools, for example, the Commonwealth should just opt out. A good example of why that would be quite inappropriate is found in last night's budget. The Commonwealth has taken a very important initiative in relation to Asian languages in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we have a national initiative, a national approach to those issues, recognising Australia's national needs and imperatives over the next few years, in terms of the Asia-Pacific region and in terms of the opportunities the region offers to young people, clearly the Commonwealth would be abrogating its responsibilities if it did not take important steps in those programs. That is why there has been special purpose funding and why the specific purpose funds ratio has increased. But that is not something that I think we should reflect on in a negative sense; it reflects the Commonwealth looking to meet its international obligations in those areas and at the same time maintaining in real terms our commitment to general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills before the House recognise the development that has occurred since 1987 in relation to what Commonwealth borrowings have been and what state borrowings arrangements have been. They go further to give effect to more transparency in those arrangements for borrowings into the future. They recognise the states and their important obligations to meet their own financial objectives and to be accountable for them to their communities. I think it is a step in terms of consolidation of those federalism provisions and one that should be welcomed by the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives legislative effect to several measures announced in the context of the 1993 budget and to a number of other changes. Some people with disabilities are unable to find jobs in the open labour market because their disability prevents them from being able to do the job to the level expected of people without disabilities. Under the existing award wage system, they have to be paid full award rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As announced in the 1993 budget, a new payment type, disability wage supplement, will be introduced from 1 July 1994. The supplement will be based on the qualification and payability conditions for disability support pension, and will be available each year for up to 1,000 people who enter the supported wage system administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. The supported wage system aims at assisting persons with a disability to enter the work force and will provide that the person may be paid less than the award wage based on his or her productivity compared with a person in the same occupation who does not have such a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disability wage supplement will be available at the same rates applicable to disability support pensioners and will be subject to similar rules, including the income and assets tests. As a result, income earned under the supported wage system by a disability wage supplement client will count as income for the purposes of determining a rate of disability wage supplement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the 1993 budget process, the government agreed that, from 1 January 1995, the maximum rate of additional family payment payable in respect of children who have not turned 16 should be increased by $1 a week per child. This bill gives effect to that agreement. Approximately 800,000 low income families will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of $45 million in 1994-95 and $46 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To qualify for age pension, a woman currently must be 60 and a man, 65. This bill provides for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991 to increase the pension age for women from 60 to 65. As announced in the 1993 budget, the increase is to be phased in over a 20-year period, starting on 1 July 1995, in recognition of any remaining labour force disadvantages incurred over the years by the older women affected by the proposal. By 1 July 2013, the women's age pension age will be 65 following pension age increases of six months every two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As mentioned previously, this bill gives effect to a number of non-budgetary measures. Firstly, the Social Security Act 1991 will be amended so as to impose a cap of 50 per cent on the rate of return for shares and managed investments for ordinary income assessment purposes. It will also be amended so as to provide that the rate of return of a managed investment or listed security that has not been available for the whole of a 12-month assessment period is to be calculated on the basis of the performance of the product to date without extrapolating that performance over the 12-month period. These are beneficial measures for social security clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as a result of amendments made by the Migration Reform Act 1992 to the Migration Act 1958, major consequential changes will be made to the Migration Regulations by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to take effect on 1 September 1994. In turn, there is a need for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow the Minister for Social Security to take account of these changes by way of disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a general sense, these amendments will ensure that relevant provisions in the Social Security Act will either refer to visas specified in the Migration Act or, if this is not possible, allow the minister to amend references to the Migration Regulations by way of disallowable instrument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third set of minor amendments are to overcome an unexpected loophole in the Social Security Act 1991 that has arisen as a result of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Social Security Act has always required that, for most social security payments to be payable, the recipient must provide his or her tax file number to the department if requested to do so by the secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Malloch and Secretary, Department of Social Security held that the principal act does not prevent payment to persons who refuse to provide a tax file number to the department on the basis that they do not have a tax file number and have no intention of getting one. Amendments in respect of all relevant payment types are included in this bill with a view to preventing payment in the situation that arose in Malloch's case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill before the House provides for several minor amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Farm Household Support Act 1992 that are consequential upon the introduction of the new home child-care and partner allowances by the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition does not intend to oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which includes a number of amendments. Several are consequential or of a technical nature. However, some amendments concern us as a coalition. The first measure in this bill is the disability wage supplement. It was a 1993 budget initiative essentially designed to create a substantial saving for the government estimated at $4.49 million over three years. The agenda appears to be not so much concern for the placement of the disabled in the work force but for improvements to be made to the government's budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has stressed that the disability wage supplement is aimed at assisting people with disabilities to enter the work force. It would appear, though, that this is not much more than a pilot scheme. It affects only 1,000 people in 1994-95, in that there are only 1,000 places available. There are plans to increase that to 1,000 placements every fiscal year thereafter. Given that the government has not allocated funds in forward estimates, we question its ability to fund an ongoing program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not oppose this provision; however, we are concerned at the level of confusion between peak disability groups, people with disabilities and the businesses which employ the people with disabilities. It appears that some confusion may be due to the involvement of peak bodies being limited to the final stages of the negotiation process. Many groups working with the employment of disabled people have expressed concern regarding the supported wage system. There is also some anxiety among employer groups that those selected for this program will lose their right to self-determination and that, rather than implementing an integrating process, the provision makes a greater distinction between those with disabilities and other workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision that the disabled must undergo an assessment every 12 months serves only to widen the gulf between the disabled and other workers, and, in addition, builds distrust of the employer groups in a scheme which relies very heavily on the goodwill of such people. We believe unions will provide some of the assessors. There is a notion that union assessors, unlike others, will not have to undergo any specific training for that task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability sector has raised a number of concerns with us. The low number of places in the scheme will not dramatically reduce numbers on the disability support pension. The disability statistics provided by DEET, DHSH and DSS back up this assertion. A total of 159,693 persons with disabilities were registered at CES offices at the end of July 1993. Of this total, 96,692 people with disabilities, or 60 per cent, were registered for more than 12 months. These figures exclude approximately 20,000 people with a disability already working in sheltered workshops. These estimates are from October 1993. A total of 406,729 people were in receipt of the disability support pension administered by the Department of Social Security at the end of June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cumbersome and bureaucratic nature of the placing of the thousand people gives rise to the question, when we talk to people who are working in this area, of whether this is the most appropriate use of what seems to be very scarce resources. This measure involves a substantial addition of staff through the DHSH and the cost of employing a team of assessors, some of whom will have to undergo special training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These continue to be some of the concerns that have been related to us from the disability sector. There is confusion regarding the level of DWS payments. There is no provision to assist employers with regard to the ongoing costs employers of disabled persons may incur. The government has made provision only for the initial outlays. There are insurance implications that do not seem to have been well considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The marketing strategy for SWS, the supported wage system, as being a source of cheap labour for business is another concern that has been raised with the coalition. There have been individual concerns raised from people who fear that the supported wage system will mean an immediate loss of their part-time income. Therefore, whilst not opposing this measure, I foreshadow the coalition's intention in the Senate to refer this provision to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next measure in this bill involves family payments. This amendment which came about as a deal with the Greens last year to get the budget through. It amounts to $1 per week per child. This will not sufficiently compensate low income earners, who will suffer the most from Labor's regressive increases in wholesale sales tax announced in the 1993 budget. Nevertheless, it was part of the budget negotiations which will be of some, although limited, benefit to those on low income. We will not oppose this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further measure in the bill relates to managed investments. The government's original motive for bringing down measures that penalise self-funded retirees was based on the usual standard, slipshod practice of saving a few dollars at the expense of those people who have been able to build a nest egg for themselves. The government struck a blow against a prudent form of self-provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two measures in this bill are designed, fortunately, to lessen some of the difficulties experienced by 100,000 Australian pensioners. Both measures are beneficial in that they alleviate some of the very worst effects of the legislation. The first measure imposes a cap of 50 per cent on the rate of return for shares and managed investments for ordinary income assessment purposes and acknowledges that high rates of return cannot be justified in assessing pensions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second measure deals with the experience arising from the Commonwealth Bank float where shares were acquired at a price which was considerably higher than the price at which the shares were originally listed. However, the initial list price was the figure used for the 12-month assessment period resulting in an exaggeration of the true performance of the investment. The amendment will ensure that this will not occur, particularly in cases where there is active trading in shares or units within a short period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange believes the amendments seem to ameliorate two of the more extreme of the illogical effects of treating unrealised capital gains as income for the income and assets test. However, it maintains that the whole system remains fundamentally inequitable. I made the following point in the House last year and I reinforce my assertion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has no understanding of the motivation of small investors. It proceeds on the ignorant collectivist assumption that the stock market is a giant lottery where the punters scan the newspapers for the right moment to seize a windfall capital gain. It does not wish to understand that so many Australian shareholders have no interest in speculative gains but hold shares in blue-chip industrial companies that provide them with a fairly steady income and modest dividend income. Such investors are often likely to sell their shares only in the event of a takeover, and to them the whole question of nominal gains and losses is an irrelevance.</PARA>
<PARA>I have had constituents in my office who, due to these provisions, have not found the notional capital gains helpful when it comes to paying the telephone bill or the electricity bill. A paper gain is an absurd premise on which to base the determination of pensioner entitlements. While the coalition supports the amendments, we continue to strenuously oppose a system that treats unrealised capital gains on shares and investments as income for pension income and assets test purposes. We maintain that this legislation is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change has the hallmark of a government that knows it has made a bad decision, but lacks the courage to admit its mistake and return a measure of social justice to the pension income test. It is a supposed compromise that admits error but does not alter the basic problem. It simply illustrates that the government lacks the courage of its own conviction. We are hopeful that, when the review into the income and assets test brings down its findings, it will recommend that the current treatment of shares of managed investments be abolished. To that end, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its iniquitous treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income for the pension income and assets test".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next provision in this bill relates to migration law. The amendment in this respect will help to reduce the lag which occurs between changes to migration law and the Social Security Act. Lag occurs because most changes to migration law are regulatory, whereas social security amendments are not. These amendments are largely technical in nature and not unreasonable, and we do not intend to oppose them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the amendment in relation to an increase in pension age for women, this provision is another Fightback initiative pinched by the government. It is simply another episode of political larceny that this government has elevated to an art form. On 7 August 1992, after the coalition announced its decision to bring the pension age for women into line with that of men, the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Neal Blewett, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition move to increase the women's pension age to 65 within 5 years is premature, ill-considered and unfair . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women who have faced greatly restricted opportunities and discrimination during their lives are being offered last minute equality to save the Opposition money.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Blewett then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the sort of two-card trick you wouldn't expect anyone to play on the elderly, but it's just one of a huge range of hidden "nasties" in the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lower pension age for women is due recognition of the fact that many older women devoted most of their lives to their families and sacrificed employment, savings and superannuation in the process. When women of pension age have had similar opportunities as their male counterparts, that will be the time to equalise pension ages, not before.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition policy would see women in their forties and fifties having to alter their retirement plans drastically. For many it would mean a substantial loss of income and late-age entry onto the unemployment queues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nothing. To claim that the government was opposed to this measure at the election and then to announce it in the next budget only five months later shows the complete contempt in which this government holds the Australian electorate. The government's backflip has been strongly criticised by the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales and the Catholic Women's League of Victoria and Wagga Wagga. In fact, only yesterday I received a position paper from the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales on this very issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of many in the community about this particular amendment relate to those women who were born between approximately 1934 and 1959 and who had little opportunity, due to the social context of the time, to accumulate savings and to contribute to superannuation funds. Pre equal opportunity and affirmative action legislation, including equal pay for equal work, many women received lower wages for equivalent work than men, and many of the women in this age bracket did not work at all. Even today, a question arises because all of the figures show that women are still earning less than their male counterparts. Until we redress that situation, it would seem to me that perhaps not enough thought has been given to those who will be disadvantaged by this particular amendment to the social security legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that the government has done nothing to either determine how many women fall into this age bracket or how they might be adversely affected by the measure. We do not oppose this measure; we advocated it at the last election and will continue to do so. It is the way in which that measure is adopted. It is a shame that the government lacks consistency in regard to its own policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next measure in this bill is the refusal to apply for a tax file number. This provision, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) has already pointed out, results from an Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision between the department and Mr John Malloch, when Mr Malloch's disability support pension was suspended due to his refusal to provide a tax file number and his refusal to provide authority to request a tax file number from the Australian Taxation Office. The purpose of this amendment is to allow the secretary to the department to refuse assistance payments to individuals who do not have a tax file number or have no intention of applying for one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is aware that one of the triggers for this amendment is the high cost of fraud in the social security area, and we are aware of the heavy burden fraud places on the Australian people. There are some doubts, though, that the continued foray into the private lives of Australian citizens via the use of the tax file number provides the total answer to fraud control. That is very heavily supported by an action recently involving Leonard Teale, the actor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 16 March this year reported in an article headed `Teale in dogfight over pension' some of Mr Teale's concerns&mdash;and just by way of background, Mr Teale served his country, Australia, as a young Royal Australian Air Force pilot in Jerusalem in mid-1944. He got into a scrap over not providing his tax file number. He refused to give his tax file number because he felt that, as a person who had risked his life to save his country, had come back, was entitled to receive a pension, and was asked for his tax file number, he should not be so shabbily treated by this government. His pension was suspended because he stood his ground and refused to supply the number. The government backed down later on and restored his pension even though he had not provided his tax file number. </PARA>

<PARA>While we as a coalition are distinctly uncomfortable with the expansion of the tax file number system, it is an issue that continues to give rise to considerable concern to this community. In 1988 there was a spirited debate about the merits of introducing a tax file number system. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) agreed on behalf of the opposition to support that legislation only because of changes made by the government to the original bill which sought to safeguard the privacy of citizens by a voluntary tax file number system. The honourable member for Kooyong said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what we have convinced the government to accept is that the tax file number system has to be voluntary. It cannot be some sort of licence to exist.</PARA>
<PARA>The then Treasurer, Mr Keating, said in response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments the government has agreed to accept are designed to guarantee that the tax file numbering system is completely voluntary. They ensure that taxpayers will in all circumstances retain the right to elect to have tax withheld at source rather than quote their tax file number. The government has always recognised that this is an important element in the set of privacy safeguards which attached to the tax file number system and these amendments will enshrine that principle in legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears now that the government is using jackboot tactics to force people into applying for a tax file number through the social security department. It is understood that the privacy commissioner has some concerns regarding this aspect of the bill and his preference would have been for the amendment that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . made clear that the decision as to whether or not an individual provides or applies for a tax file number, in full knowledge of the consequences, rests with the individual.</PARA>
<PARA>Matters of privacy and identity cards have long given rise to deep public concern, and the coalition makes it clear that we would, in government, re-examine this issue, carefully weighing the arguments. We are concerned that frequently the reason given for using the tax file number system in this way in the Department of Social Security is to counteract fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is only part of the picture. I think the loss of personal privacy and liberty by all Australians is too great a price to pay to counteract the small amount of fraud that is detected. In any event, it would appear that tax file number systems do not entirely correct the difficulties in detecting fraud. We suggest that perhaps the government should use its imagination a little and look at other ways to administer the affairs of the department to counteract those difficulties experienced in detecting fraud, rather than eroding the rights of Australian citizens, treating all Australian citizens as the lowest common denominator and assuming that they are going to try to rip the system off. I do not believe that. I believe that the majority of Australians are decent, honest people who do not attempt to rip the system off. I do not think there is a need to pass legislation that makes that assumption. I think the tax file number system is starting to head that way. </PARA>

The offset clause enables the insurer to only be liable to pay the insured person the amount which would ordinarily be paid under the policy minus the amount of social security payments the person received during the relevant period.

I welcome the contribution by the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), acting in the role of shadow social security spokesperson, and I welcome her to that position. On behalf of members of the government, I express our sincere condolences to the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) in the recent loss of his mother, which is the reason why the honourable member for Pearce is acting in his role.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the coalition for its support for this bill, even though it has raised a number of questions and has proposed an amendment to the bill. As the honourable member for Pearce outlined, there are a number of different clauses in the bill. These cover the introduction of a disability wage supplement; a measure to increase family payments; a question on managed investments, which is the subject of the proposed amendment; amendments to take account of migration law; the measure to increase the pension age for women gradually over the next 20 years; the question about the refusal to apply for a tax file number; and some other consequential amendments to various acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate my remarks this morning on two key parts of the amendments proposed in this bill: firstly, the introduction of a disability wage supplement and, secondly, the question about the gradual phasing in of the raising of the retirement age for women. If I have enough time, I might make some comments on a couple of the other measures that the honourable member for Pearce has expressed views about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I refer to the question of the disability wage supplement. As with all the other measures, this is a very positive measure which is welcomed by honourable members on this side of the House and the community at large. I acknowledge that it is a small program, that it needs to be expanded and that it is, in some way, acting as a pilot, as are a number of measures that the government is introducing with regard to assisting people with disabilities to enter the work force. But that is very much the way in which the disability community would like us to react. It wants us to introduce a range of initiatives and to find out what is the best way to manage this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to introduce this disability wage supplement was announced in last year's budget. Under the disability wage supplement, employers will be able to employ disabled people at less than award rates where their productivity is deemed to be less than that of a non-disabled person. The government will then provide a supplementary payment similar to a part rate disability support pension. The program has the support of peak employer and employee bodies and aims to increase the employment opportunities for disabled people without their being financially disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of difficulties are involved in Australia in determining the extent of disability and the effect that that disability has on people's employability, their skills or what their rate of pay should be for their contribution in the work force. The surveys of the Australian Bureau of Statistics use a wide definition of `disability', while that used by the Social Security Act 1991 is based on a person having at least a 20 per cent impairment. As all honourable members would know, that tends to be a very subjective measurement. It is very hard to determine what is a 20 per cent disability. I am sure all of us have had constituents come to us with concerns about the fact that they have applied for a pension based on disability but have been refused because they have not been deemed to be 20 per cent disabled. It is an issue of ongoing concern for a lot of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of government actions in relation to people with disabilities since the 1980s has altered from providing specific institutions for disabled people to greater integration with the community. That is something that should be applauded, and I know it is supported by both sides of politics. This can be seen from programs where we have been closing institutions for people with mental disabilities and replacing them with community accommodation. There has also been a similar trend with regard to people with other disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the many changes in this area has been the movement away from large institutionalised sheltered workshops to schemes that encourage disabled people to participate in the mainstream labour force. Currently, such schemes are based on finding employment at award wages through the competitive employment, training and placement program; supported employment where the government directly employs disabled people, usually in small work groups; and the provision of training through special programs and mainstream programs such as jobstart and skillshare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the honourable member for Pearce indicated the opposition's intention to have this matter referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. I draw her attention to the fact that the employment of people with disabilities was examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs which released its report in April 1992. The report examined existing schemes which assist disabled people to gain employment and it made a number of recommendations for improvements to the situation. This disability wage supplement is part of the committee's recommendations. We are implementing recommendations of that Senate standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee made a whole series of recommendations, all of which I support, which went to a range of government agencies who are involved in assisting people with disabilities to get into the work force and to stay there. The committee recommended that the Commonwealth government implement a wage system to meet the income needs of people with disabilities unable to work full time at or above award wages and that the Commonwealth direct resources towards ensuring that at least a living wage, which may be made up of part pension and part wage, should be the basis of pay received by people with disabilities in paid employment, even though this may not be an award wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is clear that the government's introduction of this disability wage supplement is consistent with the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It was supported by both sides at the time. It is now being introduced in this legislation and should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of people with disabilities gaining access to employment is one that I have been personally involved with for the whole period that I have been a member. I have been working very closely with the various ministers for human services and health and whatever various titles we have had for that department over the last four years to try to improve access for people with disabilities to the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me have been opportunities for people exiting school, finishing at special schools and then, at the age of 18, being left virtually high and dry with nowhere else to go. There does not seem to be a lot of coordination by the various government agencies to assist those people to then go that next stage into further training, further employment, assisted employment or whatever. It is not just the responsibility of one government agency; a number of government agencies both at the Commonwealth level and at the state level are required to get their act together to assist these people. At the Commonwealth level, the Department of Social Security, the Department of Human Services and Health and DEET all have a responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security and the Department of Human Services and Health have been reasonably good. There is some room for improvement but they have basically been pretty good in providing assistance for people with disabilities and coordinating government support. My biggest area of criticism is with DEET. I do not think DEET has met its responsibilities in assisting people with disabilities to enter training programs and get employment. DEET has expected other government agencies to do that for it. It has been one of my criticisms that I do not seem to be able to get much of a response from my DEET officers in trying to tackle this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my area I have at the moment some sixty 18-year-olds with a range of disabilities attending special schools who will be seeking to leave those schools and who will have no place to go. It is a matter of some concern to me that I have great difficulty in getting DEET to accept that it has some part to play. I have no problem getting the disability sector of Human Services and Health to be involved and to try to assist, but it also needs the support of DEET. We need to make sure that the regional officers of DEET can coordinate access to training programs, to TAFE colleges, to other private providers of training and to assisted employment much more than they do, instead of expecting the Department of Human Services and Health to do all the work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early this year the government announced a new program called jobnet, which is designed to coordinate the provision of vocationally oriented assistance to people with a disability. Again it is a program under the Department of Human Services and Health. It appears that Human Services and Health has had to assume the responsibilities that DEET has of providing vocational education and training assistance. It is unfortunate that we cannot get a coordinated program amongst the three departments for people with a disability as we have so successfully been able to achieve with the JET program, where we have been trying to assist people on single parent pensions to get back into the work force. It has been a very successful program of coordination between DEET, DSS and Human Services and Health to identify and coordinate the various needs of those people so that people can get training and then go back into the work force. We should be getting a much better coordinated program in place for people with disabilities. DEET needs to pick up its game there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one problem I have with the jobnet program is that it only concentrates on the vocational orientated assistance. It is not picking up other areas of support that is required. The family of a person with disabilities needs somebody not only to help get that young person a job or into training but also to assist with the transportation needs of that person, with further nursing or support that may be needed when the person is in an institution or workplace and assistance with accommodation. A range of other assistance measures may be needed, not just training. Therefore, we need to get a program in place that appoints case managers. In the white paper we had a lot of talk about appointing case managers to help young people get jobs. People with disabilities probably have an even greater need for a case manager that can coordinate all of the government agencies at a Commonwealth and a state level to fix up all of those needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the complaints that families of people with disabilities make to me all the time is that, whenever they want to access any sort of program to help the family member progress to the next stage in his or her life, they have to set up a committee and lobby to get money to do all these things, whereas a normal, able-bodied person can go straight in. They ask, `Why do we always have to fight, form committees, write submissions and lobby just to get access to those basic things?' I agree with them. It is not just the Commonwealth responsibility, because half of those things I talked about are state responsibilities. We need to get both  levels of government working together and appointing case managers so that, when a child reaches 17 or 18 years of age and leaves a special school or a mainstream school, the family can go to this person and say, `What is the next stage?' This person can then coordinate all of the various levels of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That program works to some degree in Western Australia, the state the honourable member for Pearce comes from. We in the caucus community services committee have looked at that model and have been urging the government to consider it. I understand that a pilot of that model will be introduced in this financial year. I am not exactly sure where, but I understand some funding will be put in place for the appointment of such a coordinated program. I think that case management process would be a very successful program for people with disabilities. It can then bring together all of the various streams of government assistance that is provided through the Department of Social Security and the Department of Human Services and Health. Maybe it will get DEET off its backside to do some more work, as it should be, for people with disabilities, and also coordinate state government agencies to provide transportation, accommodation, health services, et cetera. So that is where I would certainly like to see further assistance provided by the government in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area I would like to comment on in this bill is that of the phasing in period of the retirement age of women, which is to increase to 65. The honourable member for Pearce made a lot of play about the fact that this was a proposal put into Fightback, that the government opposed the opposition's proposition in Fightback and then, six months later, introduced it in the budget. The honourable member for Pearce failed to compare the two proposals. The proposal in Fightback was for an almost immediate introduction of a retirement age to 65 for women, phased in over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government announced this last August and gave two years notice of its intention to do this. It brought in a phasing in period which is very gradual&mdash;a six-month stepped increase each two years, so it takes 20 years for it to be fully introduced. That was a far more reasonable and sensible proposition. The government clearly opposed the opposition's proposal, because it would have been unfair, too fast and would have created enormous difficulties for a lot of people. The government's proposal is a much more reasonable and realistic way of introducing it. That is why there is quite a contrast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second and probably more important point that we need to make concerns the reasons why the government believes that it can go down this way. Through this government's policies in labour market reform and in the introduction of a superannuation guarantee, we are ensuring that women have much greater access to superannuation coverage than they would have had under a coalition government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget the other plank that was in Fightback. The opposition intended to abolish the superannuation guarantee charge. That would have had quite a negative impact on women's capacity to access superannuation. Superannuation coverage has increased from 40 per cent in August 1988 to 94.1 per cent in August 1993 for women employed full time and from nine per cent to 45.7 per cent for women employed in part-time positions. That has been achieved under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's policies, in attacking the superannuation guarantee charge, would have destroyed that success. They would have eliminated in large measure superannuation coverage for those women who had it. It is because of our work on superannuation and the fact that we are phasing this in gradually over the next 20 years to the year 2013 that we can confidently predict that it will have very minimal impacts on women in their access to superannuation and other forms of income through the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been under this government that we have seen quite significant improvements in the participation rate of women in the work force. Over the last 10 years that participation rate has increased dramatically because of our policies, which have assisted women to re-enter the work force through increased access to training programs, employment programs and work force programs. This government has also assisted them by the massive increase in the provision of child-care support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One needs to look in total at the policies that the opposition was proposing and at its past performance compared with this government's performance. When we look at what we have done in superannuation, in workplace training and in giving women much greater access to the work force and to child care, we can see that this government has been responsible for ensuring that many more women have opportunities to work, to earn larger amounts of money and to raise their own personal retirement benefits through superannuation and other means. Therefore, this is a reasonable policy that we are introducing in allowing a phasing-in over 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the international situation. I have a list of about 15 OECD countries with similar economic development to Australia that have equal retirement ages for men and women. The retirement age is 65 for men and 65 for women. This is not some dramatic change that we are introducing that is contrary to international experience. It is supported by the women's movement and it is supported by the Council on the Aging. In fact, the Council on the Aging had a proposal which was a more dramatic introduction than the one we are introducing. I think both measures should be supported. I commend the bill to the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) gives effect to several measures announced in the 1993 budget and to a number of other changes which will have a significant impact on the elderly and the disabled in particular. Despite the strength of this impact, the federal government has once again dumped many measures together in one bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill requires careful scrutiny as it covers a wide area of far-reaching administrative and policy changes. It revises the wage setting framework for the disabled. It increases the pension age for women to 65. It caps the deemed return from listed securities and managed investments at 50 per cent. It allows greater administrative flexibility in response to change in immigration laws. It increases the rate of family payment by $2 per fortnight. Also it puts beyond doubt that receiving a social security benefit is provisional upon submitting a tax file number. Many of these measures will be beneficial to Australians and have coalition support, but there will be winners and losers because the federal government often gets things wrong at the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some amendments are nothing but a knee-jerk reaction to legislation which has been denounced as unfair and fundamentally flawed at the start. There are others that could fail miserably despite the best of intentions. The introduction of the disability wage supplement, for example, aims to broaden employment opportunities for the disabled in the open labour market, but the coalition notes that many sensitive issues remain unresolved. Under the supported wage system, the disabled will be paid less than award wages based on a formula calculated to measure and compare their productivity with a `normal' worker doing the same job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will form an assessed wage paid by the employer, which will then be supplemented by the disability wage supplement paid by the Department of Social Security and based on the qualification and payability provisions of the disability support pension. But many within the disability industry, while pleased with the concept, have doubts about the administration and outcomes. As a result, we believe these concerns about the disability wage supplement should be heard by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs when the legislation reaches the other house. In light of the feedback from advocacy and disabled groups, it is important that the bill faces further scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who sadly is not here to hear me say this, spoke very sensitively about the needs of the disabled. They are obviously important to him, and he understands the role of carers and the way they are disadvantaged. I am also well aware of the earlier Senate inquiry into this matter and its recommendations. The honourable member mentioned that the disabled groups are bringing up concerns relating to the administration of this area, and I think it is entirely appropriate that their concerns be heard by the Senate committee. Perhaps some small amendments will be made to help the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assessment procedures may leave the disabled open to exploitation in the workplace. How and who determines what is 60 or 80 per cent of a standard worker when there is no benchmark measurement? According to Disabled People's International in South Australia, there are concerns that disabled people desperate to secure work will trade off a lower assessed wage in return for employment and therefore not receive any financial benefit. Disabled People's International does not want sheltered workshops simply broken up into the community; it wants a proper program which will take the disabled beyond where they are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prevailing economic and labour market conditions mean that opportunities for the disabled are low. In a country where the number of long-term unemployed has exceeded 300,000 and where the unemployment rate hovers around 10 per cent, surely opportunities are already limited for all Australians, not just the disabled. The emphasis is on increased productivity, international competitiveness and enterprise bargaining, which must marginalise opportunities for those who cannot work at the optimum rate. What about the cost for the employer? It is important that the Senate standing committee be allowed to examine these concerns, even though the scheme is due for introduction across Australia on 1 July. There are only 1,000 places available and 80 of those are earmarked for South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also brings the pension entitlement for women in line with that for men. This government, in cheating and scaremongering its way back into power at the last election, made some fairly outrageous claims. In campaign material to residents of the electorate of Kingston, the then Minister for Social Security said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has gone very quiet on its heartless policy to lift the pension age for women from 60 to 65. But it's still there. Is it something you really want?</PARA>
<PARA>Yet it was something that the federal government secretly did want. The August budget announced and endorsed this very `heartless' policy that the minister had denigrated less than six months before that, and today it is enshrined in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another demonstration of the dishonesty, distortion and broken promises from a government which campaigned on removing pensioners from the tax system and then reneged days after the election. In principle, I support the concept of men and women being treated equally. People are now living longer and women live longer than men. Broken work patterns resulting from child rearing and family responsibilities mean that women do not have the same capacity as men to plan financially for their retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has only been in recent times that women have had access to superannuation, so they will need another five years of earning a salary to avoid poverty. But this is only an advantage for those women in the paid work force. Again, there are losers. Even the government has acknowledged how difficult it can be for both men and women to be aged 60 and out of work. Although it has only a two-year life span, these people aged 60 and without work are currently entitled to the mature age allowance. This relieves them of having to go through the activity test associated with newstart. It also has the effect of removing them from the published unemployment figures. There would not be a member in this House who has not had contact through his or her electorate with those who are of mature years but who are too young for an age pension and, realistically in the current economic climate, too old for a paid job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The provision of the bill that deals with managed investments and listed securities and assessing non-realised capital gains as income for pension purposes is the subject of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) which I was pleased to second. The only good thing that can be said of the provision to cap deemed income at 50 per cent is that 50 per cent is better than anything higher than 50 per cent. The fact remains that these changes are subject to an independent review of the pensions income and assets test, which is now under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those in the community who have been thrifty and anxious to provide for their retirement have been patiently awaiting the outcome of this inquiry, which the coalition has sought since 1988 and which only this year has been taken up by the government. The 1988 legislation which dealt with managed investments was flawed. The cap is a compromise in commonsense to what was a bad piece of legislation in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The age pension is the cornerstone of independence in the retirement of older Australians. But it is universally acknowledged that it is cost prohibitive to provide a pension to all retirees regardless of their income and assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a nation, our long-term objective must be to ease the burden on age pension payments. This means that people must be encouraged to save. But the government sends all the wrong messages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Older people need predictability. The 50 per cent cap goes some way towards avoiding the wild swings in pension payments. But the reality remains that pensioners cannot eat their capital gains. In their desire for a predictable pension, part pensioners will be excused if they follow the message `Squander your savings, sell your assets and then you will qualify for a pension and a predictable income'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There are significant concerns about the inequities, inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the current system. This system is resulting in older people making decisions not on the basis of the investment product but on the basis of its impact on social security entitlements. While it is impossible to fix every anomaly or inequity, current decisions by the government always seem to be reactive with no firm ground rules or underlying principles. We now have the totally inequitable situation of separate classes of pensioners receiving different treatment regardless of their income and assets but dependent upon the time they purchase their investment. There is also the need for complex calculation and record keeping, which means higher administration costs for the government and unstable pension rates for recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With an ageing population, there is a real need for sensible legislation and planning. The Economic Planning Advisory Council's latest report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's ageing society</EMPHASIS>, predicts that the number of aged people will rise from 1.9 million in 1991 to more than 5 million by the year 2051 when more than one person in five will be over the age of 65. There will be a six-fold increase in people aged 80 and over from 373,000 to more than 2 million by 2051. According to one of the report's authors, Ross Clare, this means that the proportion of the over 80s will jump from 2.2 per cent in 1991 up to eight per cent by 2051. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Understandably, it is this age group which calls upon a disproportionate amount of money via the public purse. The report also said that by 2051 part pensions will need to be provided for about 75 per cent of the aged, who will not be able to rely on adequate superannuation payouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> When consulting with groups and individuals in my electorate about this legislation, I receive the constant advice that this provision of the bill is further tinkering with what was originally bad legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do believe it and I am pleased that the honourable member for Prospect is indeed laughing at the Treasurer's pathetic efforts last night. This bill aims to do a number of things: introduce a disability wage supplement, increase the pension eligibility age for women from 60 to 65 years, increase the rate of family payment by $2 per fortnight, cap the deemed returns from listed securities and managed investments, and allow more administrative flexibility in response to changes in immigration laws. In the time allocated to me, I intend to concentrate mainly on the aspect of the legislation dealing with shares and managed investments, an area of Labor government which has sparked an angry reaction from pensioners and retirees not only throughout my own electorate of Fisher but indeed throughout the entire country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I do that, I mention some other matters included in the bill. There is an amendment to the Social Security Act relating to the disability wage supplement. That was part of the 1993-94 budget. The disability wage supplement is a payment which will be available to disabled people who enter the work force under the supported wage system, a program administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. Under the supported wage system, disabled workers are assessed by employers and the union or an accredited assessor to determine the amount of work they can do as a percentage of the work a person without a disability can do. It is a laudable aim that we give every opportunity to those who are disabled to perform a worthwhile role in the work force. Those people will then be paid a percentage of the award wage based on productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability wage supplement, which provides additional income support, is paid under the same eligibility conditions as the disability support pension but differs in some areas. These include that persons remain qualified for DWS for 12 months after gaining full award wages, enabling them to receive the income supplement if their wage falls below award. The disability support pension is restricted to people unable to work full time at full award wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has allocated 1,000 places under this scheme in 1994-95. This amendment has caused confusion and concern amongst groups and businesses who train and employ disabled people. In other words, the government is making it more difficult for the community and business to assist those people who are indeed the object of assistance under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid further confusion and misunderstanding, I very strongly support the suggestion from this side of the House that this amendment be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs for further consideration. Far too often, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;you would know this as you have been here for many years&mdash;we see legislation that is processed through the parliament as if it were a sausage machine. The legislation is defective, with the result that the minister must enter the parliament to seek further amendments. I think an ounce of prevention is better than a ton of cure and I really think our request that this matter be referred to the Senate committee is indeed very appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a number of years employer groups, unions and the Department of Human Services and Health have been negotiating the supported wages issue. The whole issue has emerged as a result of efforts on the part of the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Human Services and Health and the former minister to move people with disabilities out of sheltered employment and into open employment. There are many groups in the community who have serious concerns about the placement of disabled people in the open work force. I imagine that we could talk to any number of people in the community and get differing views. There are some who say that it is beneficial and appropriate that disabled people be as much as possible in the general workplace. There are others who feel that disabled people, because of their disability, are better suited to working in an appropriate sheltered workshop. I suppose that it really depends on the degree of disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern of disability groups is the fact that the government is just scratching the surface of this problem. The number of placements available&mdash;1,000&mdash;is not enough even to fill current requirements. I understand that, at the end of July 1993, almost 160,000 people with disabilities&mdash;that is, 160 times the number of places being made available by the government&mdash;were registered at the CES. Many people also share my concern that the bureaucracy is far too cumbersome. The bureaucracy in this country has not served the people well and any amendment which seeks to hand over more authority to the bureaucracy is probably moving in the wrong direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also confusion and misunderstanding over the level of the disability wage supplement. There are no provisions for on-costs that may occur as a result of employment of a person with a disability. Insurance implications associated with employing a disabled person have been ignored. That is fairly unfortunate. I hope the government takes it on board, because insurance implications in today's litigious society are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are concerns relating to training, to assessment of disabled employees, to the use of the SWS as cheap labour for business and individual concerns that the scheme will mean that people with disabilities will lose part of their income or that the system might be abused by some employers to reduce the wages of people with a disability who are already in employment. Disability organisations, sadly, have had limited input into the negotiation of the disability wage supplement, making a mockery of the government's consultation process. Because of this and the concerns I have previously listed, it is really vital that this matter be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, which would enable the proposed changes to be very closely looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures in the bill include increasing the maximum additional family payment by $1 per week per child under the age of 16. This measure was part of the result that emerged from the budget negotiations with the Greens after the delivery of the 1993 budget by the former Treasurer. Neither this nor the amendments to take account of the migration law are being opposed by the coalition. The migration law amendments are of a technical nature, aiming to reduce the lag between changes to the migration law and changes to the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been discussion in this House over the proposal to increase the pension age for women from 60 to 65 years. As has been mentioned, this was the coalition's policy before the last election and it was condemned by the government. One need only look at the remarks made prior to the election by the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett, who described the coalition's policy as `premature, ill-considered, extremely harsh and unfair'. He also said, `It is the sort of two-card trick you would not expect anyone to play on the elderly.' It is the two-card trick that this government is playing today on elderly women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this matter, as in so many other matters, the government is indicating its hypocrisy. We came forward with the policy prior to the last election. The government condemned it. It denied that it had a similar policy. Yet, almost immediately after the election result, the government is saying, `We tricked you again. We said we weren't going to do it before the election but we are going to do it now.' That is really a matter of very great concern. It does nothing for the integrity of the government and does nothing for the way in which politicians and this parliament are regarded by the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Historically, the labour force participation rate for women has been lower than that for men. This has been responsible for the distinction between men's and women's pension ages. The change in women's pension age from 60 to 65 will take effect over a number of years. The government has done a complete backflip on this issue. It is about time that the government gave us honesty instead of lies, lies, lies. The coalition is not opposing this measure. It would be hypocrisy for us to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is also not opposing the proposed changes relating to the provision of tax file numbers to the Department of Social Security. I have some concerns about this matter. I hope that the tax file number does not become a de facto Australia Card. The government believes that it is important for people to prove their identity prior to the receipt of social security payments, and I can understand why there would be some need for verification of identity. Similarly, I get very concerned over the fact that our electoral system is open to widespread rorting as anyone can gain enrolment on the electoral roll simply by posting an enrolment form into an office of the Australian Electoral Commission. There is no requirement to prove identity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any ill-motivated individual would be able to fill in thousands of enrolment cards, send them off and those enrolments would automatically be placed on the electoral roll. By the time the Electoral Commission might have discovered in a subsequent habitation survey that those people do not live there or even exist, an election could well have been won or lost. I think all parties in this place have a vested interest, as indeed do all Australians, in the integrity of the electoral system. I certainly hope that the government will look at this matter very seriously prior to the next election, because I believe that the present situation is unacceptable. </PARA>

This measure has two elements: it contains amendments which propose a cap of 50 per cent on the rate of return for shares and managed investments for ordinary income purposes, and it provides that the rate of return of a managed investment or listed security that has not been available for the whole 12-month assessment period be calculated on the basis of the performance of the product to date without extrapolating that performance over the 12-month period. I have to give the government credit where credit is due: these are steps in the right direction but, sadly, very small steps. But it is better to take steps, however small, in the right direction than to move in the wrong direction, as the government is doing in so many other policy areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Stock Exchange says that these two changes have the capacity to ameliorate two of the most extreme of the effects of treating unrealised capital gains as income for the purpose of the income and assets test. But the Australian Stock Exchange, like the coalition, maintains that the entire system is fundamentally inequitable. Really, what the government is doing in this policy area is kicking those people who have worked for many years, those who in many cases have gone to war to ensure that we are free and who have helped to create and forge the Australia that we have today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really think the government stands condemned for its whole policy in this area. We should be helping those people to whom we owe so much.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its iniquitous treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments as income for the pension income and assets test.</PARA>
<PARA>There probably has been no single issue in my electorate since the March 1993 election which has generated more complaint. I am also referring to people who claim to have been Labor voters for their entire lives. People from Kawana and Caloundra to Caboolture, Bribie Island, Kilcoy, Blackbutt, Toogoolawah, Cooyar and Nanango have been outraged. It does not matter whether they come from the city, the coast or the country. I dare say that members on both sides of the House would have had this experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The electorate of Fisher has one of the oldest populations of Australia. We have 15.5 per cent of the population who are aged over 65. In neighbouring Fairfax, another Sunshine Coast based seat, 16.2 per cent of residents are aged over 65. It follows that a very large proportion of the Fisher population would be affected by the government's iniquitous legislation. In fact, this has been the case. I have received and continue to receive hundreds of letters and phone calls from pensioners who have panicked about their future since the announcement of Labor's intentions last year. It is not only full pensioners who have been affected by the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares. With the drop in interest rates, many self-funded retirees who have been forced to become part-pensioners have also been adversely affected. A lot of those people, of course, never expected to be part of the social welfare system. They find that all of a sudden the nest egg that they have is eroded, and often the pension they are entitled to disappears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the deeming arrangements produce only a paper income unless the person sells the shares or disposes of managed investments. Quite often, many people who were worried about what the government was saying actually sold their shares prior to the government announcing that people who held shares prior to August 1992 would not be affected. Once the government changed the rules&mdash;of course the government went down the road for a very long time of saying it was not going to change the rules&mdash;those people could not then go out and buy the shares again because they would then be affected by the provisions. What is more, in many cases some of them had to pay capital gains tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased that there is now a review under way. I certainly hope that the review is going to be a serious review. I hope that the government's deeming arrangements with respect to shares and managed investments will indeed be repealed as a result of the review. It should be noted that shares held prior to August 1992 were not affected, but shares bought after August 1992 are. People who have acquired managed investments have not been so lucky. They, of course, remain affected in a very serious way, regardless of when those managed investments were acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really dreadful to find people who have absolutely no ability to look after themselves in a financial sense, except for the small nest egg they have put aside during their working lives, actually not receiving any real income</PARA>
<PARA>from that nest egg but losing pension entitlements because of the deeming arrangements over shares and managed investments. That is why I am pleased that the government has taken these small steps in the right direction. It would be better if the government scrapped its proposals altogether. I am confident that this will happen following the results of the review. But we will just have to wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Electorates like Fisher, and indeed most of the other seven poorest electorates, are represented by conservative members and have very low family incomes. Fisher is ranked as the fourth poorest in the nation in terms of families with an annual income below $16,000; 26 per cent of Fisher's population is in this income bracket, while only 6.6 per cent of families in the electorate earn more than $60,000. So it is interesting to see that conservative members represent the poorest electorates, making a mockery of the claim that the Labor Party is the party for the underprivileged. If any person still believed that myth, it would have been exploded last year when the government brought in the deeming arrangements with respect to shares and managed investments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have often spoken either before or following the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), and I can recall his contributions when he was previously a member of the National Party of Australia. They have not changed much in that time. They are usually extravagant, often ill-informed and often quite fanciful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the honourable member for Fisher really thinks that the coalition government would change the rulings on shares and so on, then he is in for an awful shock. He is really suggesting, and some honourable members on his side have attempted to beat up, a concept that investing your money in a building society or in a bank and having the income from that deducted from your pension is valid and okay; but he is suggesting a further concept that people should invest money in shares and, when those shares are sold, the income derived from the increased value would not affect the pension. Clearly he is going to cause a major problem in the investment industry and a major discrepancy in how the government of the day would treat various forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the philosophy underpinning this is indisputable. There is no way that any government should favour one form of investment over another. There is always going to be an argument as to the methodology. I have said that over a couple of years now, and I still say it. The principle has to be applied. The methodology is again under review, as is appropriate. I hope that we will review it often. Whenever a system is introduced we find that a whole industry springs up around it. We have found this in the share industry. The changes on managed investments back in 1989, in turn, produced an advisory industry where people were investing directly in shares, which meant that they were therefore exempted. Those loopholes that emerge need to be corrected, and any government, Labor or coalition, would do much the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the coalition to be running around the countryside talking about how it is going to make sure that the income on the sale of shares does not affect pensions is fanciful and misleading. Quite frankly, given the coalition's economic prescription for the country during the last election campaign, when it was so roundly rejected, closing the loophole would be the very first thing that a coalition government would do. Obviously, the honourable member for Fisher does not listen to his colleagues in the shadow ministry when they put forward their prognosis and solutions for cutting government expenditure and saving money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he suggests that this will open up a major loophole in the pension system of this nature, he is not kidding the community because obviously it did not believe it in the lead-up to the last election. This was canvassed very fully during the last election campaign; it was a major issue. The coalition was still defeated. He might believe the rhetoric, but the community certainly does not. I am sure that most people in government and in the departments would not believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation also lays to rest another furphy that we keep hearing. We have been hearing in recent days how the white paper of last week, Working Nation, and the budget of last night are all about shuffling figures off the unemployment queues. The reality is that in the term of this government we have transformed the nature of recognition of work. It has been politically very difficult and socially quite challenging and demanding, but it has been enormously important that we have stopped denying the notion of work to a whole range of people in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This includes women who have become widows, who historically were automatically seen as being pensioned off for life, whether they were 35, 45, 55 or whatever. The notion that a widow was somehow automatically a pensioner and therefore condemned to a subsistence level of income, and not given support for employment and training, seemed to be natural to those opposite. We have said that those women are now notionally members of the work force. We have extended the work force substantially by that one act. In effect, we have increased the number of people unemployed. Rather than shuffling people off the unemployment list, we have actually put them on it. In many cases that has been very difficult. Within that context we have also tried to ensure that there was adequate support for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group that has been dramatically affected by that is people with disabilities. Hundreds of thousands of people on disability support pensions and the old invalid pension were seen to be pensioned off, in many cases with a relatively minor and static complaint. They were given no support for employment or training. They were seen to be virtually written off for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the introduction of the Disability Services Act in 1988, the government has made changes to legislation in an attempt to show that disabled people have something to offer. We have to give them the opportunity to show society what they can do, rather than what they cannot do. There has been a sea change in social legislation and social support. At the same time, there has been an increased number of people who are notionally out of work as disabled people have now become part of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of the work force has increased by some four per cent since 1983. The work force now includes people such as women who, under previous governments, would normally have received the widow's pension. It also includes people with disabilities who previously would have received the invalid pension or the disability support pension, but who are now seeking work and, in many cases, getting it. The increase in the size of the work force has been a conscious process by the government in an attempt to achieve a fairer and more equal society in which people are seen to be supported. Over the last week, members of the opposition have claimed that we have reduced the number of people in the work force. But the facts show the opposite. We have consciously and deliberately increased the size of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation establishes the introduction of a disability wage supplement, as was announced last year, which will commence on 1 July. This supplement will bring the wages of people with disabilities up to what would be the award wage for a particular position, given that in many cases they will be less productive. That is a moot point. Many of these people could be fully productive if they were given a chance. This legislation does allow for their full participation in the work force. In the past disabled people had to either get a pension or work. We are now offering them a mix of income support and wage support when they are in productive employment. This will enable people who have previously been sidelined in our society to take a more active part as full contributing members of the community, albeit with lesser productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular change poses problems with respect to how the assessment process is determined. We have to protect people with disabilities from misuse or abuse by some employers who may not be so compassionate and thoughtful. But our experience with employment support for people with disabilities has been successful. I want to publicly congratulate businesses such as Sizzler, which at a national level has undertaken some quite major and exciting programs. People with disabilities are actually working in Sizzler restaurants in a really meaningful and productive way. That has been extremely valuable. In Newcastle we have an organisation called Castle Personnel which has been involved in open supported employment and which initiated the Sizzler program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been shown that these things can work. Whilst these programs have been done in a focused, localised and productive way, the disability wage supplement is a much broader instrument which will allow a much wider range of services and a much wider range of employers. Obviously, this program will build up. To start off from day one trying to cater for all people with disabilities will not be meaningful, but the concept and the process are extremely valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Fisher and other opposition members in general have indicated that this bill also will be sent off to a committee. The poor old Senate. Lionel must be turning in his grave, having helped establish a Senate committee system to review legislation. When I ask senators what they are doing with their committees and how productive they are, they tell me that they are so bogged down with stuff being referred to them that the quality of their reporting has dropped. So it is a bureaucracy reporting for them because the senators do not have time, and delays are being caused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of referring things to committees again and again, which is what the opposition is trying to do, has become almost an art form now. Yet the same people have the audacity to criticise the government for delays and for how long things take. The hypocrisy involved in what we have been watching in the 12 months since the election is mind-boggling. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been here for the term of this government and I have watched the opposition for that time. At times I have thought it was quite productive and constructive. In the last year, however, its performance has been abysmal, which has been unfortunate. People in the community with disabilities need positive encouragement and support, not the kind of carping, negative nonsense we heard from an earlier speaker,  the honourable member for Fisher. We as members are in touch with our communities. We understand what is happening with people with disabilities. We know their needs, if we are doing our homework, and we can feed those into the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earlier speaker should have been doing so for the last year. To say that it needs a Senate committee to do that means that he has not been doing his job. What is more, he is passing the buck to that Senate committee. Where has he been for the last 12 months? He has been a member of this House for more than a year now. This issue has been on the agenda for the last eight or nine months. Where has he been? This issue has been on the public agenda for years. The honourable member has had every chance to contribute to this legislation, as we all have.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have no constituents, the people who almost all reside in capital cities, are going to now have a committee look at this. And what will happen? The Senate bureaucracy will respond to it because our colleagues in the Senate are absolutely flat chat. There is no way they could get their heads around this kind of stuff in a meaningful, constructive way in a reasonable time.

If he is shirking his responsibilities that way, then why bother pretending to represent?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change is enormously important. It is in danger of being misused and abused unless both sides of this House are supportive and constructive about it. That is why the message sending the legislation off to the Senate is so dangerous. It means that the opposition is now going to play political games with what should be a unanimously supported piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever legislation we introduce, whatever new system we bring in, it will have its early days of teething troubles, of bedding in, of training, of getting ourselves, our departments, the community and the community organisations used to it. That is a normal part of the process. The idea that somehow sending it to the Senate will solve that or avoid that is impossible. What the opposition is really trying to do is delay it past 1 July. That is what it is about, so it cannot be brought in at all on 1 July. Then it can say that the government broke a promise. And who suffers?&mdash;the people with disabilities, whom this program would help. The cheap, shoddy manoeuvring of those opposite is absolutely appalling to a group in the community who for all of our lives has been sidelined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is saying that these people are part of our community and need to be seen for what they can do and supported in what they can do. The quote being used, `judge them for what they can do', is very valid. They are being brought into the mainstream for the very first time, for so many of them. What is happening? This legislation is becoming a political football to be postponed past 1 July so that the opposition can then accuse the government of failing these people. I find that morally reprehensible and appalling. Most of those opposite should perhaps stay home during these sessions and let the Senate do the job for them. That seems to be their role these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have touched on the matter of shares and I, too, welcome the review which will take place on that. As I said, it is unfortunate that those opposite somehow seem to think that, having lost the last election when this was a major issue, the community is in favour of what it is putting forward. The community in Australia is a very fair community. When it sees a possible loophole and an abuse of the pension system by shareholders, which is not available to people who invest in banks, building societies or other forms of interest bearing investments, it will in no way support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the provision of tax file numbers is obviously important. The loophole that was shown up by the AAT ruling recently needs to be plugged. The fact that the legislation apparently does not require or compel a pensioner or recipient of benefits to provide a tax file number is clearly an oversight. It was not intended and, therefore, needs to be corrected. The whole idea of the tax file number in the system is to make sure that people's earnings are brought into account in assessing benefits in terms of their demand on the public purse. That was clearly a drafting flaw which was never intended, and it is very important that that be corrected soon&mdash;not be delayed, postponed and procrastinated over because of some nonsense from the opposition in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be realised that the pensionable age for women will not finally be increased to 65 until the year 2013. Again, this is another example of the work force size being increased. The government is deliberately and consciously increasing the size of the work force, which automatically means the unemployment rate goes up because there are more people in the work force. So, in the year 2013, when pensions are available only at the age of 65, the work force size will be automatically increased by women who are 60 to 65. Quite frankly, most of those people want to work. A lot of people out there want to work beyond 65 as well&mdash;and very many do work. The fact is that this particular amendment, despite what the opposition says, is actually increasing the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to reinforce is that people with disabilities are part of this community, and this legislation is vital. It is depressing and demoralising to find the opposition trying to push the legislation off to a Senate inquiry. That is clearly aimed at the committee not reporting before 1 July so that the legislation will not become operational. That is the wrong message and a tragic message for those people who have for so long sought recognition and a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We claim all the time that we are a fair society. We tell the world how fair we are. The fact is that we are fair only if we fit the system.

If the government were a little more open-minded about these things, it might realise there is a possibility of some of this legislation being improved, particularly the delivery of these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is lacking on the government benches these days is the preparedness to recognise the facts that not all the wisdom in this nation sits on those benches and that there is a contribution to be made in a positive manner by other members in this place and certainly by members of the other place. I think we are all very serious about our representation of different aspects of our constituencies, particularly those that we are debating in this bill today. I take umbrage a little bit at some of the comments of the honourable member for Newcastle. I for one certainly am very genuine in my comments on this amendment bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is concerned, in particular I will concentrate my attention on three areas: the disability wage supplement, the changes to managed investments, and the changes to the pensionable age of women. Obviously they are three very contentious areas within our community which certainly are not restricted to any particular electorate or constituency. Whether the area is represented by a government member or by a coalition member, the issues remain the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disability wage supplement will be based on the qualification and payability conditions for the disability support pension and will be available to people who enter the supported wage system administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. It will be available from 1 July 1994. I refer to the assumption of the honourable member for Newcastle that, just because a Senate committee may get the opportunity to scrutinise this bill, it will hold it up. It may well not hold it up; it may well make amendments that improve the delivery of these services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the SWS, a person with a disability may be paid less than the award wage, based on his or her productivity compared with that of a person in the same occupation who does not have such a disability. There are 159,692 people with disabilities who are CES registered. In Port Macquarie, in my electorate of Lyne, there are 613 people CES registered. In Taree, also within my electorate of Lyne, there are 961 people CES registered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very supportive of the disability wage supplement. Employer and employee groups throughout the electorate have spoken very highly of the direction of this proposal. I think this is a step in the right direction for employment prospects for people with disabilities. The trend currently taking place in our community is a movement away from large institutionalised sheltered workshops to schemes that encourage people with disabilities to participate in the mainstream labour force. Whilst I think it is important not to forget the worth of sheltered workshops in specific cases, I welcome the move towards a more integrated work force. This is definitely a step forward for all parties involved, particularly those with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In April 1992 the employment of people with disabilities was examined by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. The report, which examined the options available for people with disabilities to help them gain employment, made several recommendations. This is one of those Senate committees to which the honourable member for Newcastle is not overly anxious to see too many aspects of this bill being sent off. Some of the recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs were that adequate funding be provided to enable increased access to services for people with disabilities; that full-time employment is not appropriate for or may not be achievable by all people with disabilities; and that programs be established combining work, study, recreation and other activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other recommendations of the committee were that part-time employment options be delivered for people with disabilities unable to undertake full-time employment; that the Commonwealth government implement a wage system to meet the income needs of people with disabilities unable to work full time at or above award wages; and that the Commonwealth direct resources towards ensuring that at least a living wage, which may be made up of part pension and part wage, should be the basis of pay received by people with disabilities in paid employment, even though this may not be an award wage. I therefore welcome the government's reforms as a follow-up to these 1992 recommendations. It is pleasing to see the government take note of some Senate recommendations once in a while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the government members who speak on issues such as this one in this place seem to think that they have just arrived here and that they are all great initiatives that they are just implementing. They should be reminded sometimes that they have been in power for in excess of 10 years and it has taken them this long to start addressing these issues. So I do not think that the people of Australia should see the government as the great white knight and the saviour of these particular interest groups, because it has taken the government a long time, with these matters going through some of the more contentious committees of inquiry of the Senate, to reach these outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I welcome this move, I do hope the government will recognise the possible areas of concern with this change and monitor them to make sure the system is not open to abuse. Maybe, just maybe, there are areas in the legislation open for abuse that have not been identified in this place&mdash;in the drafting of the bill, with the bureaucracy and the minister's department involved&mdash;that may well be picked up by a Senate committee of inquiry. I continue to harp on the point that I think it was an unfounded criticism made by the honourable member for Newcastle that all wisdom is located in the minister's office and with the bureaucracy, and that nobody else should have the opportunity to have input into the legislation. I suppose that, if the honourable member for Newcastle had a far greater background in areas outside of this place, he might understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is a real need to review the efficiency of the program coordination between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Human Services and Health. The supported wages system has been shown to be far too cumbersome and bureaucratic in the past, and this must not occur after these reforms have taken place. One local authority was very critical of the bureaucratic process involved in gaining a slow worker's permit from the Industry Commission. These issues will hopefully be ironed out with this reform but, if not, the government must examine its interdepartmental efficiency in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern that I have is the amount of confusion and misunderstanding that exists within the electorate. There have been extensive reviews over the last few years examining this area, many of them drawing completely different conclusions. I hope to see the government addressing this issue over the next few months before the DWS is introduced on 1 July this year so that everyone involved is clear about what the government is actually doing. For example, I have been contacted by one person who has a disability but has been fortunate to find full-time employment within the award wage system. This person was very concerned that he may lose part of his wage due to a disability that has in no way impaired his ability to work. These issues need to be clarified by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government needs to address some of the issues involved here from an employer's point of view as well. For example, the government has not yet addressed whether there are any insurance implications for business&mdash;in particular, the higher premiums involved with the employment of people with some forms of disability. I see that the government has acknowledged initial outlays for businesses employing people with disabilities, but there is no provision for future on-costs involved. These are the cruel realities of business and, until the government addresses these issues, the door into full employment will not be truly opened to people with disabilities. I also share the concerns of the Welfare Rights Centre in that the operation of the DWS is structurally faulty in the early stages. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Welfare Rights believe that the legislation should allow people coming off DWS to be presumed qualified for the Disability Support Pension, at least in regard to the 20% impairment rating and the continuing inability to work criteria. Currently when participants leave the scheme or are faced for a suspension period in which they are now receiving DWS they will have to lodge a new claim for the Disability Support Pension. This may take up to 8 weeks to be processed due to the medical examination requirement. In the intervening period they will probably be receiving Job Search Allowance and therefore face the prospect of having to attempt to find work for which they and their medical advisers believe they are unfit.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, whilst I support the general direction of this legislation, I think a great deal of finetuning needs to be done to improve the legislation in its current form. I therefore support the move to refer the matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs which, I reiterate, must have some expertise in this area. There is obviously some direction it can have. The committee is made up of elected representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;the same as we are&mdash;and I think that it would do well for those on the government benches to recognise the fact that all the wisdom on these matters does not sit on the government side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now move to the issue of family payments. From 1 January 1995, the maximum rate of additional family payment in respect of children who have not turned 16 will be increased by $1 per week per child. This is estimated to help around 800,000 low income families. On the mid north coast of New South Wales&mdash;particularly in my electorate of Lyne, where the average household income of only just over $20,000 per annum is one of the lowest in Australia&mdash;this measure will be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we must remember the background to this measure, which is the result of the government's deal with the Greens during last year's budget process. This measure is supposed to counteract the increases introduced by the government in wholesale sales taxes announced in last year's budget. So while it is giving with the one hand, the government is certainly taking away with the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The people of Australia should recognise that, although in last night's budget there were not too many baddies as far as increases in taxes, they were all announced last year. Low income earners around Australia in particular are going to bear the brunt of the $800 million increased sales taxes this year. This is only just a bit of a fob-off to the Greens to offset the government's tax and spend attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The next item within this omnibus bill that I would like to cover is that of managed investments. I do not think there is an issue that has been so broadly covered within everybody's electorate as the issue of managed investments and how this government has treated it. Again, this measure was passed in an omnibus bill before I entered this parliament. It seems to be a habit of this government when introducing legislation that may be opposed or rolled over to stick it in an omnibus bill where it will not be wise to vote against the whole bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already come up with one backdown on the treatment of shares, including the capital appreciation of shares. It diddled with that and caught a lot of people out in changing their dates. It will now fiddle with the managed investments aspect of the treatment of investments for capital gains. It is a step in the right direction, but it should be completely abolished. It is an admission by the government that it is wrong, that it is electorally unsound and that it will cost it dearly at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I welcome this move by the government that recognises, at least in part, the faults that have emerged in its ridiculous managed investment reforms. Whilst I would have much preferred to see the total abolition of its reforms on unrealised capital gains on shares and managed investments, I think this step towards improving the scheme is at least a start by the government in recognising that it was wrong. I will continue to fight&mdash;I am sure that all my coalition colleagues will also continue to fight; we have seen an amendment moved by the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan)&mdash;to see the current system of income and assets testing of pensioners totally abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two measures being introduced are beneficial. The first acknowledges that high rates of return on shares and managed investments cannot be justifiably used as unrealised capital gains for pension assessment purposes. This is particularly the case where the rate of return is calculated to be in excess of 100 per cent, meaning that the rate of income that is assessed is greater than the value of the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The second measure deals with the experience arising from the Commonwealth bank float, where shares are acquired at a price that is considerably higher than the price at which the shares were originally listed. The initial list price will no longer be used so that the artificial inflation of the investment return does not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been astounded by the number of people this issue has affected within my electorate of Lyne. Countless people in the mid north coast have vainly tried to work out the government's harebrained formula on this issue. They have been totally frustrated by the retrospective nature of the legislation and have had to completely reassess their retirement plans after they have actually retired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been the dirtiest piece of legislation that I have seen in my short time in parliament. I condemn the government for introducing the provisions in the first place. I call on the government to ensure the true independence of the current income and assets test review so that we can hopefully see some changes to this legislation throughout the upcoming year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Over the years, the government&mdash;I go back to the point I made earlier&mdash;has been in power for many years. It has made numerous changes that affect self-funded retirees, part pensioners and pensioners alike. Over those years, people have made their plans for retirement and relocation based on the policies of the government of the day. The government has shifted the goalposts. It has had an enormously detrimental effect on many pensioners and part pensioners throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unrealised capital gain cannot buy bread, meat and milk. It does not pay the rates. It does not pay the phone bill. It does not pay the power bill. I believe the government is now recognising the error of its way. We certainly commend to the government that it go on from the removal of part of this legislation to the complete abandonment of it because of the devastating effect it is having on the retired population in Australia, certainly the pensioners and part pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last aspect of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill that I want to touch on is the increase in the pensionable age for women. This move is a complete turnaround by the government since the election in 1993&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mrs Crosio) need not shake her head. In a minute I will read to the parliamentary secretary a media release that was put out at the time by the then Minister for Social Security, Neal Blewett. This government's tactic of tucking a contentious bit of legislation in amongst an omnibus package is starting to get out of hand: it did so with the managed investment legislation, it tried to do so during last year's budget, and it is again trying to do so today. This is a tactic of the government's which skirts the boundaries of ethics&mdash;if there are any such things left in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is going to increase the pensionable age for women from 60 to 65 years. This will be phased in over 20 years, starting on 1 July 1995. The government said that this was a Fightback initiative, but the government has not picked up on the fact that the coalition's proposal was in line with other non-discriminatory election promises, including the abolition of the compulsory retirement age. The ironic part of this measure having been part of Fightback, however, is that we can now refer back to the government's comments on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One year ago the classic line and the true example of government deception at the election came from the then Minister for Social Security. He labelled the policy&mdash;the same policy that this government is introducing today in this bill&mdash;as premature, ill-considered, extremely harsh and unfair. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the sort of two-card trick you wouldn't expect anyone to play on the elderly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the coalition's policy for the election last year. I certainly do not entirely agree with that policy. I do not believe that the Commonwealth will gain the perceived benefits from moving the pensionable age of women from 60 to 65. The next thing the government will do in a sop to the community to offset this change will be to introduce the mature age allowance eligibility for women of the age of 60. Men are eligible at the age of 60 now, so the real pensionable age is not 65. I go back to the then Minister for Social Security's media release. Neal Blewett said in that media release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition move to increase the women's pension age to 65 within 5 years is premature, ill-considered and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Women who have faced greatly restricted opportunities and discrimination during their lives are being offered last minute equality to save the Opposition money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's the sort of two-card trick you wouldn't expect anyone to play on the elderly, but it's just one of a huge range of hidden `nasties' in the Fightback package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lower pension age for women is due recognition of the fact that many older women devoted most of their lives to their families and sacrificed employment, savings and superannuation in the process. When women of pension age have had similar opportunities as their male counterparts, that will be the time to equalise pension ages, not before . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The media release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Opposition policy would see women in their forties and fifties having to alter their retirement plans drastically. For many it would mean a substantial loss of income and late-age entry onto the employment queues.</PARA>
<PARA>I tend to agree with some of his comments, but within 12 months we have seen the government do a complete 360-degree-turnaround on this issue. It is going to change women's pensionable age. Maybe when this bill gets to the Senate, this aspect of it should be referred to a Senate select committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, I would like the right of reply to those who have spoken in this debate. I refer particularly to the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan), the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) covers a number of details, but I will cover only those matters that have raised concern for opposition speakers today. They include: disability support, shares, tax file numbers, and women's pensionable age. In covering those matters I will reiterate why we will oppose the amendment before the House. The amendment&mdash;other than being a cheap political shot&mdash;is basically saying that the opposition is not declining to support the second reading, but that it condemns the government, et cetera. I do not see any sense in that, for the simple reason&mdash;which at least two speakers acknowledged in their speeches; the honourable member for Pearce failed to acknowledge it&mdash;that the government has set up an independent inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is really saying, `You have already set up the independent inquiry; we are still going to tell you we do not like it, but we are not going to wait for the inquiry before we take any other steps.' The government has been condemned because it has taken into consideration the concerns that have been raised. It has, through this legislation, addressed some of those concerns and has called for an independent consultant to review those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independent consultant is very publicly going around taking submissions. The consultant is talking to both the welfare groups and the finance groups. We expect to have a preliminary report in July, and we will have a full report in September. If the opposition does not agree with some of the recommendations that come out of that, maybe then it will be time for the opposition to start saying where it should be going with that. The legislation before the House is really about addressing those wider concerns. The opposition should be involved in those public submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the shadow spokesperson on social security, the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has been very much involved in this process and has been very attentive to the action that has been taken. I join with the honourable member for Moreton and convey to the honourable member for Berowra the government's condolences on the sad loss of his mother. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take up the concern that was raised by the honourable member for Pearce and repeated by other opposition speakers, and that is the disability wage supplement. Those opposite have stated that people and organisations have not been consulted. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, that consultation has been going on ad infinitum. The recommendations contained in the bill came out of that consultation. We have put new arrangements into place. This is not a pilot. We are putting into place arrangements, decisions and commitments that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those workers with a disability will be assessed either by the worker's employer and the union&mdash;so they should be&mdash;or the employer and an accredited assessor. Concern was raised by the honourable member for Pearce that an assessor is an extra bureaucratic arm that will need to be employed. That is not the case. Those people are already there. They are part of the employee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember at all times that, whatever decision we make in regard to people with disabilities, it must be made in consultation with a particular worker. There needs to be an assessment as to what percentage of work that person is able to do and, therefore, what percentage of wage is able to be paid. Again, that assessment has to be undertaken in line with productivity capacity and it has to be undertaken with consultation. We know not only that that is in place and that we have the consent of the unions and both the employer and community groups but, most particularly, we have a large group of people out there with disabilities who want to come into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been condemned in the debate here this morning. It has been said that the so-called 1,000 places is a paltry amount. That so-called 1,000 is a damned sight better than none. The government cannot be condemned for not acting to take steps to bring these people into the work force, then condemned for not assessing it and doing it properly and then condemned because there are a lot more people who suffer from disability who need to be assessed. The government, with the bill before the House, acknowledges all of that. We want to do it well, we want to do it gradually, we want to do it in consultation, and we want to do it to make sure that no person is ever going to be taken advantage of. I do not necessarily mean just the person with the disability; I also mean the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, on both sides of the House, we should be commending those people who, through a lot of time, effort and consultation, have brought this particular amendment to the House. I state again that the legislation will continue to be monitored. It is not a pilot. Money has been allocated. Money was allocated in last year's budget and has been again in this year's budget. Money has been allocated, with commitments, going right through to 1995-96 and 1996-97. We will continue to support those particular programs with those particular people. As we see it in operation and up and running, we will also have other people coming forward and a commitment to ongoing involvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other general points that I would like to touch on. On the disability wage supplement, as I stated, the assessors are existing employees of our employment agency. There is no confusion. The only confusion&mdash;the information came back to us through our very wide consultation&mdash;has been on the pension versus the wage supplement policy. That has been clearly spelt out. It has gone back to the organisations concerned, and they have agreed with it. We, as the government, have always demanded that we have a third party involved. That third party, as is stated in the bill, can be either a trade union or the trade wage assessor. We also believe that persons must be free to involve, if that is their wish, an advocate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to how an agreement should be drawn up with the legislation before the House, it will be drawn up by the worker and his or her employer. It will then, we understand and hope, be ratified correctly by a delegate of the Department of Human Services and Health. Why is that necessary? That agreement itself is valid for a maximum of 12 months, but it does give the right to either party to renew it, provided it is the certified rate wage that has previously been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lack of consultation has been indicated as confusing by some of the opposition speakers in their remarks. If those opposite say we have not been consultative, I would just bring up some of the areas of consultation that have taken place. We have had lengthy consultations with the ACCI, with the ACTU and with the peak disability organisations, as I have stated, not over the last three months or over the last 12 months but for three years. It has been quite public consultation. Nothing has been hidden. We were not running around to a little corner and saying, `Here's another little clause we want to put in a particular bill. The opposition won't notice it. We're really not going to help those people; we're really going to make a sham of it.' That has not been happening. It has been very open and the consultation has been very thorough indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parties supported what went into the budget in 1993 for implementation in 1994. They supported that quite publicly. When we talk about what is happening and about the opposition supporting a bill, we need a little bit of honesty and a little bit of openness as to what is really happening out there in the community. The honourable member for Pearce was very concerned that the budget did not supply the funds. Again I say to her, `Read it.' It was placed in the 1993-94 budget. It goes right through to 1996-97, and it will continue to be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of great division and debate from those opposite in their supporting of this bill was the pensionable age. A lot was made of this. Before I come back to some of the comments I wrote down when listening to the speakers, I would like to repeat my call for honesty&mdash;not the hypocrisy. The honourable member for Lyne and a couple of the other opposition spokespersons brought up what our previous-but-one Minister for Social Security was supposed to have said. I too have the same newspaper in front of me. It was the supplement taken out of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> of 6 February 1992. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Minister, Dr Blewett, said yesterday he would like to eventually see `equality in the provision of age pensions'. But he said the move would have to be phased in gradually to ensure women were not disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA>The article then went on about how, at present, men retire at 65 and women at 60. A lot of to-do was made about that. It was said that the government was back-pedalling, that the government was backing down, that the government was not really committed to what it is trying to do, that the government was breaking another promise and that the government has taken on the opposition policy. Let us be very honest here too: what a load of hogwash! The government has said, very plainly and clearly, that the phasing in of the new pensionable age of women will occur over 20 years&mdash;not over the next three or five, but over 20 years. We will give women of this country adequate notice so that the situation can gradually be assessed and so they understand and appreciate what is going on. Bear in mind that only a woman who is  64 years and six months will be affected on 1 July 2013 when the last increase occurs. Then she turns 65, of course, and comes of pensionable age on 1 January 2014. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been increasingly difficult to really justify the different qualifying ages of men and women in our country. When we talk in both houses of this parliament and in the state houses about qualifying ages for men and women and when we look at our domestic and particularly our international equal opportunity requirements, how can we continually say that it is right to have this inequality? Former minister Neal Blewett at all times said that equality in qualifying ages has to be achieved on a phased-in basis, that its introduction has to be equitable and that it has to be very fair. In a majority of cases women will qualify for other income support, as is the case now. I think the honourable member for Lyne touched on that. Of course, at the moment that is called the mature age allowance. Gradually the name may change, but it is always the policy of our government to make sure that people are cared for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council on the Ageing supports the mature age allowance in the bill. In fact, it thought the government was being too generous. In its support for the proposal the council asked, `Why aren't you phasing it in by the year 2000?' We said, `No, that is not justifiable and we must phase it in with consent and with a gradual process.' I was particularly pleased with the comments of the Council on the Ageing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the honourable member for Pearce that at no time can she quantify the request for a tax file number in the case she referred to as a tax file jackboot operation by this government. What hogwash! The legislation before the House allows the Department of Social Security to compare only Department of Social Security recipient records with tax records under the data-matching act. It actually lessens the privacy intrusions. It is also an alternative to getting a full list of all taxpayers from the ATO and data-matching against that particular list. It is strictly intended only for detecting fraud and I am pleased that some members of the opposition have acknowledged that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most particularly, we have had ongoing discussions with the Privacy Commission. I do not know whether it was by way of an interjection or whether it was a comment in one of the speeches by someone from the opposition benches, but I know that someone was concerned about why certain amendments were not here. It is because of the ongoing consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, and we believe we need to spell out the situation very clearly. That is one of the amendments that will be coming into the House. I would have liked to have brought it in here, but the drafting process has not been completed. It will eventually come through this House and go through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to convey my appreciation to the honourable member for Moreton. I believe he has a very true understanding, but more particularly an appreciation, of what disabilities and disabled people are all about. I particularly commend him for bringing to the notice of the House that these amendments are a result of the recommendation of a Senate standing committee. We are being told, `Let us put it back to a Senate inquiry.' A Senate inquiry is set up to investigate a specific area and that Senate inquiry makes recommendations. The government, through the process of time and legislation, takes those recommendations on board and either amends the particular bill with which those recommendations are concerned or brings in fresh legislation to make sure that those recommendations from the Senate inquiry are covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done that. We have had a long, intensive Senate inquiry. Recommendations have come forward that we must concern ourselves with the disabled people and bring them into the work force. At the same time, we must make sure they are looked after, are assessed and have an equitable chance. After we have done all that, we are being condemned. So, obviously, those in government are condemned if they do and condemned if they do not. We are condemned because we have taken the Senate committee's recommendations on board, and have brought them into legislation in the amendment bill before the House. We will now be condemned because we have not given enough consideration to the recommendations and there may be concerns and problems. What the opposition has now stated is that it is going to send the bill to a Senate standing committee. I just wonder where the legislation is going to end up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement the honourable member for Newcastle made about the Senate and its workload needs to be made again and again in this House. We are the elected representatives who have constituencies at large. We are the elected representatives who have the right to come in here and debate these bills. We are the elected representatives who have the right to move amendments and, if at all possible, have them carried. If they are not carried we have the right to make sure that our feelings and the concerns of the constituents we represent are heard in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we actually have that put into practice, the opposition says, `Wait a minute. We know a Senate inquiry has gone on. We know the government has taken it on board. We know the government has amended the bill. We know the government is putting that into practice. We know the government is doing all of that with consultation. We know the government has been consulting for three years. But wait a minute. It hasn't gone far enough. We had better take it back to a Senate inquiry because Senate inquiries are the be all and end all.' I say time and time again, and without being in any way derogatory to our Senate colleagues, that really it is the people out there who are waiting to be employed&mdash;the people who are waiting to be part of this so-called 1,000&mdash;to whom we should give some consideration as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So regardless of what happens in the Senate&mdash;I acknowledge, and the government acknowledges, we may not have the numbers there to direct whether this goes to a Senate inquiry or not&mdash;I say to those opposite that they should also acknowledge the fact that it is the community at large which is waiting to have this implemented on 1 July 1994; the community at large which has been consulted over the last three years; the community at large which has also put submission after submission to the Senate inquiry. This community is now saying to the government and the opposition, `For God's sake, act.' That is what we are saying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at it further, if that is what the opposition is going to do. But let us also acknowledge that the budget allocation is there to meet our commitments and let us care for those people to whom we want to make those commitments. That is something we have to acknowledge at all times. I am particularly pleased that the two speakers on our side of the House made mention of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the honourable member for Adelaide needs to have a few things cleared up for her. I acknowledge that she had, at least, acknowledged the fact that that independent inquiry is under way. Surely she has to agree that the actual amendment is nothing short of a political statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly interested to hear the way the honourable member for Fisher carried on about where he thought we should be going or should not be going. We cannot have it both ways. Let us at least give consideration to the disabled. The statement of the honourable member for Fisher with reference to the then Minister for Social Security, Dr Blewett&mdash;I suggest honourable members read it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;was nothing but bare-faced, two-faced hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased with the commitments made by both the government and the opposition. I believe that at all times we have a right of free debate in this House, but, as I said in the House to the Leader of the National Party of Australia, I think I have a right, on behalf of the minister and the government, to answer some of the concerns that have been expressed by the opposition. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 re-introduces the amendments proposed in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 with the exception of part 7. Part 7 of that bill dealt with amendments to the managed investments legislation. The 1993 bill was laid aside by the House of Representatives on 24 February 1994 following disagreement between the houses about the inclusion of part 7. Aside from renumbering to take account of this omission, the remainder of the 1993 bill has been duplicated in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposed the amendments to the managed investment legislation as they are beneficial to service pensioners with this form of investment. There are not `winners and losers', as the opposition tried to argue during the debate on the 1993 bill. There are only winners. This is reflected in the commencement date of the proposed changes, which was to ensure that the amendments retrospectively commence from 1 April 1993. However, in weighing up the totality of the bill, I feel that there would be a greater injustice in not passing the bill at all, particularly to the 10,000 veterans and their dependants who would not be able to get the Commonwealth seniors health card from the Department of Veterans' Affairs from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the measures in this bill. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Building on strength</EMPHASIS>, the government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a Commonwealth seniors health card. The government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill meets the second part of that commitment by introducing a Commonwealth seniors health card from 1 July 1994. This card will give certain low income non-service pensioners access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits, hearing aid concessions and optometry services. It is estimated that this proposal will assist a total of 10,000 veterans and dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also befitting in the Year of the Family that the government proposes a bill containing amendments to the child related payments legislation. These amendments introduce greater flexibility in the delivery of child related payments, recognising the important role of primary care givers and the financial burden placed on them. This initiative is part of the government's ongoing commitment to families. The main features of this initiative are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the ability to redirect child related payments to the partner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">adjusting the pension payment in shared care cases so that the child related payments are also shared;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">backdating child related payments to the first payday after the date of birth in those cases where notification is received within 13 weeks of the birth; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">ensuring, where pensioners have children and are receiving maintenance income, the maintenance income only affects the child related payments. </PARA>
<PARA>These changes result in a more equitable method for assessing child related payments and flow from the family payments structure under the Social Security Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pension for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. At present, this provision applies only to disability pensions paid under part IV of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service. The amendment ensures that the offsetting arrangements will also apply to disability pension paid under part II in respect of war or operational service. This provision will apply only to payments of compensation made after the date of royal assent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also clarifies the operation of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. In such instances, the Veterans' Entitlements Act currently directs that the person's pension or allowance is not to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments set out the effect of failing to comply with a request for a tax file number and introduce a generous reconsideration period. It is proposed to give the person three months from the date the pension was last paid to comply with the request for a tax file number and still receive full restitution of the cancelled payment. This would allow the person time to consider the consequences of failing to provide the tax file number. If, however, a person complies with the request after the expiration of the three-month period, the pension or allowance will then be restored from the payday after compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This three-month period is in addition to the 28 days that the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs already allows the person to comply with the request before action is taken to stop the pension payment.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This amendment puts beyond doubt the intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this initiative will apply only to pensioners required by the Secretary to provide a tax file number. If the individual or a pensioner category has been exempted from providing a tax file number, these amendments will not apply. Another initiative simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension. It allows for a person to orally withdraw an application or a claim and to reactivate that application or claim, within 28 days of its withdrawal, without penalty to the original one. This initiative is consistent with the aim of assisting pensioners in their dealings with the department by encouraging oral communications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment will be made to the definition of `income' to exempt from that definition payments received from the New South Wales Medically-Acquired HIV Trust. This follows a similar amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1992 which exempted payments received from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, this bill will make a number of minor changes in the area of service pension assessment including a series of technical and consequential amendments. I commend the bill to the House. </PARA>

So the double dissolution circumstance and opportunity have now been removed from the political agenda for the time being, depending on what flows from the budget legislation and other legislation to come before us in what is going to be a very busy session of the federal parliament between now and 30 June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget for veterans is a most interesting element of the budget. There are some welcome payments&mdash;$20 million in additional funding for young veterans over the next four years to be offset, however, by some changes in the small print which I highlight to the RSL and to veterans around Australia. Firstly, the intermediate rate and TPI pension will no longer be granted to veterans over the age of 65 years. Let me hasten to add that all existing TPI pensioners will continue to receive their payments. I do not want to run up an argument on any inaccurate dimension, and I have discussed this with the minister. Once the relevant legislation passes through as a consequence of the budget, new grants of TPIs will not be made to those over the age of 65, with that additional qualification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is directed at a perceived anomaly, where public servants around some of our capital cities and others who might have had wartime service suddenly choose to take a retirement package. Many of them make a learned decision to become farmers on small farms around capital cities and then utilise their new career of farming as being one relevant to the consideration of their eligibility for a TPI. It is alleged that they then go in with a raft of applications for intermediate rate or full rate TPI pension in circumstances where that was not the original intention associated with a totally and permanently incapacitated pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight, in conjunction with my colleague Senator David MacGibbon, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, that quite apart from the rights and the wrongs of that, there are others who are permanently working in their particular industry&mdash;quite often it is the farming industry&mdash;well beyond the age of 65 who may well seek, quite properly and legitimately, an eligibility for and the granting of an intermediate rate or full TPI pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second element just in passing in the small print which I think is probably of more critical concern, and that is that disabilities will be measured against a norm for given age. A medical tribunal will make decisions in relation to the degree of disability. The government proposes to set up the Repatriation Medical Authority comprising medical specialists. The authority will formulate statements of principle that exclusively state what elements of medical scientific evidence will be necessary to establish a causal association between a veterans disease and injuries in war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They might like to start by looking at the air conditioning system of this parliament, because there is one humdinger of a virus going around this place in this particular budget sitting week. I often think the air conditioning in this parliament is designed to make sure that a cross-section of every virus, cold and flu from 148  electorates is assembled and intermixed at 2 o'clock on Tuesday. All of us, including the hardworking staff, are guaranteed to be exposed to these viruses and rather debilitating conditions which have imposed themselves upon me in the last 36 hours. But I will battle on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More seriously&mdash;serious as the health and workplace environment of people who work here is&mdash;on the question of this tightening up of disability pension eligibility, the coalition has legitimate concerns that in the small print of the budget, assessment will be made much tougher for older veterans who have served this country in time of war. We have concerns which will be addressed in more detail in the legislation which is to come at a later stage, or in the tabling of instruments, which will be disallowable instruments, and we will study them at that time. But we do so against a judgment that upon this parliament rests a responsibility to see that the right things shall be done for those who have served their country in time of war. There should be no short-changing in that regard. That brings me back to the legislation before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other elements of the legislation before the House have been detailed in the minister's speech. Therefore, I will not delay the House, other than to say that we have consistently indicated our support for all but the managed investment components of the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The minister has now taken account of this, and I acknowledge that. Therefore, the Liberal and National parties will not oppose this new legislation in its new form. Nevertheless, we have a particular query. I refer the minister to his media release dated&mdash;curiously enough&mdash;1 April 1994, April Fools' Day. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The previous Minister asked the Secretary of my Department to reconsider sympathetically the exemption guidelines for the provision of tax file numbers following representations from a small number of clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Secretary has now determined that those pensioners, who receive ONLY a disability pension and can provide proof that their income and assets preclude them from receiving an income support pension or benefit from my Department, may be exempted from providing their tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Department will be writing to those pensioners whose pension has been suspended or cancelled under the former guidelines advising them of a new exemption provision. They can then reapply to have their disability pension reinstated if they meet the new criteria.</PARA>
<PARA>I have two questions for the minister on the specifics of this legislation. My first question has several parts to it. How does the new part 7 of the new bill&mdash;a completely new part 7, because the old part 7 was taken out&mdash;which relates entirely to the provision of tax file numbers, square up with the minister's 1 April statement? In the detail of it, does it in fact obliquely bypass the thrust of the minister's assurance by a sin of omission? Where in the new part 7 does it specifically relate to and guarantee the utterances of the minister with regard to the provision of tax file numbers? I have a second and related question. If at the end of the day people are in one of these other categories and fail to provide their tax file number, presumably even under the new part 7 they will still lose their pension payment at that time. I seek clarification of that. I will listen with interest to the minister's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax file number situation is a very important threshold principle. Senator MacGibbon has raised it. Leonard Teale is one particular veteran who took an in-principle stand which led to an alteration of the situation as announced by the minister in his statement of 1 April. Before the House we now see legislation detailing part 7 of the bill in a curiously worded way which at the end of the day still leaves in place the suspension if people do not comply with the issue of the TFN. So there are two related issues to the new part 7. Firstly, does the minister's statement of 1 April in exactitude not conflict with&mdash;and in fact has it been taken up in&mdash;the provisions of part 7 of the bill? Secondly, at the end of the day, if those in other categories of veterans pensions still do not provide the TFN, presumably the pension remains suspended. I want clarification of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of repatriation and veterans affairs arrangements over the years has been well recognised. For two years this parliament debated the first veterans entitlements bill to try to streamline repatriation legislation. Even so, it seems that we have to layer on additional legislation, often reflecting beneficial decisions for veterans. Some of it is so complex&mdash;and I will not bother to delay the House by reading extracts from this bill&mdash;that it is a necessity, even in the plain English legislative drafting that we now have before the House, that we now have 69 additional pages of complexity attached to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility of the government, the minister and the parliament is to see that there is no excessive addition to the burden of bureaucracy and complexity associated with the administration of veterans affairs so that at the end of the day the services and the outcomes are delivered in as simple a form as possible so far as the legislative base of repatriation in this country is concerned. As the minister will no doubt come back to the parliament yet again with a further round of legislation and/or tabled instruments arising from the budget, I appeal to the minister to be ever mindful that if it can be done in 11 pages instead of 69 pages then of course it should be done in 11 pages&mdash;if that can be the case, given the complexity associated with repatriation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposed to this legislation. I have lodged my queries with regard to the new part 7. It is a victory that the government has changed its mind, changed its course, and dropped the old part 7. By that action and by our attitude on the floor of the House this day, responsible as it is, the only double dissolution trigger before the parliament has now evaporated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill has been debated for some time. I am pleased to note that the government has finally capitulated to the wisdom of the coalition and omitted the clause relating to managed investments. The coalition did not agree that changes to managed investments should be introduced in this bill before the committee inquiring into pensions and managed investments had reported. We would not be party to changes to the assessment of managed investments and other retirement income while at the same time the government was examining the entire system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not fair to chop and change managed investments legislation, particularly when dealing with an aged veteran and pensioner community. How are people supposed to prepare for their retirement when the rules keep changing? The Australian Democrats supported us in this move; however, it has taken some months of persuading for the government to see the light. The government had been claiming it could not wait for the committee's report on managed investments. As my colleague Senator MacGibbon stated in the upper house, the answer to this is that the government must put more resources into the committee to assist it to report as early as possible. Therefore, I welcome the government's capitulation and look forward to its giving way on further legislation in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a strong veteran community in my electorate of Grey, with just over 1,500 veterans receiving benefits. I recently had the privilege of attending Anzac Day celebrations in Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Whyalla, which is always a very moving experience. I think it reminds all of us in a very timely way of the contribution that has been made over the generations. I think one most encouraging point that my colleagues have brought home to me in recent days has been young people's interest in and respect for Anzac Day, and this is perhaps no better illustrated than by the attendance at the Gallipoli Peninsula on 25 April over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many veterans have approached me with concerns about the government's treatment of their income and assets. I am disappointed that last night's budget offered them so little. The budget did declare an extra $20 million for the welfare of younger veterans, however, this increased funding is merely a diversion to hide the real decreases in veterans' benefits. Many veterans will no longer be compensated for physical disabilities as a consequence of their service experience, which often become apparent in advancing years. As a result, the government will save $18 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will also set up a medical tribunal to determine claims, whose decisions will not be challengeable. There is no doubt that the government has set up this tribunal to save dollars. Those dollars will come from veterans. The aim of the tribunal is to reduce the number of veterans who will be granted compensation in the future. I do welcome the long overdue announcement of the $20.6 million rehabilitation program for war veterans, also welcomed by the Vietnam Veterans Association. Vietnam veterans have been rightly angered for many years at the government's non-acceptance of their need for help. This money comes after the recent failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to acknowledge our veterans when he was in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other budget moves, it is pleasing to note that, after many years of lobbying by our merchant mariners who served in World War II, they will now receive the veterans pension for the first time. Even the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), acknowledged that this recognition of the mariners was long overdue. The Kokoda  memorial is also to get $900,000 in 1994-95 and a further $700,000 in the subsequent year, and this is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I return to the subject of the government's assessment of pensioners' and veterans' managed investments which, as I mentioned earlier, was the subject of contention in earlier debates on this bill. An inquiry into this was clearly urgently needed. The unfairness and anomalies under the present test are estimated to have affected 200,000 people who hold managed investments. In September last year, 55,670 pensioners had their pensions decreased because of a reassessment by the Department of Social Security. This saved just over $1 million for the government. If the government continues to penalise pensioners and veterans for saving and investing for retirement, many will simply dispose of their productive assets to maximise their pension entitlement. The government does not seem to be able to come to terms with that fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that pensioners' and veterans' unrealised gains on shares are just paper gains. They do not provide cash, they do not provide food. As least as much as any other group in our society, our veterans and pensioners require security for the future. They need to be able to plan their retirement, particularly with a government which is so strict on pensioners' and veterans' own individual plans and savings. In conclusion, with this bill the coalition has ensured that the government is kept in check and some stability is given to veterans' incomes. </PARA>

So I wish the minister good luck in this particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has already pointed out, this bill is a major victory for both the opposition and the veterans community. It reintroduces the amendments which were proposed in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), with the exception of part 7. It was part 7 of the bill which was so strongly objected to by the opposition and, eventually, the government could not get part 7 of its original bill through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its credit, the Senate is responsible for the government now being forced to back down and exclude the provisions of part 7 of the original legislation which dealt with an area not too far removed from the one I mentioned earlier when we talked about the unrealised capital gains on pensioner share portfolios. That similar and somewhat related area is that of the treatment of managed investments, which the government was also attempting to foist on both social security beneficiaries and Veterans' Affairs pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are delighted that the bill has now been brought back in this form and, as the Leader of the National Party said on behalf of the opposition, we support broadly the provisions of this particular bill because they are generally advantageous to veterans, and there will always be support on this side of the House for legislation that supports veterans. I am very proud to be a member of a Liberal-National Party coalition which has over the years consistently and comprehensively demonstrated its support for veterans and their families. I am very proud of that fact. When the government brings in legislation which enhances the position of veterans, it can always be assured of our support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it was up to some of its old tricks with the original legislation that it introduced, the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), because there it attempted to lump in a number of things that were beneficial to veterans with something that was clearly not beneficial&mdash;a trick it has tried a number of times before. It is a fairly crass political tactic to ensnare the opposition in a difficult position as to whether it supports or opposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases it has been a very successful political tactic, because it has put us somewhere between a rock and a hard place: if we vote against a bill where there are some advantageous provisions, we are likely to be interpreted as being unsupportive; in the other case, if we support the bill as a whole, we are caught on the other side of the fence. In this particular instance, though, the tactic has failed badly and the government is left&mdash;and I would like to hear the minister admit it&mdash;with considerable egg on its face because it has been forced to bring back this legislation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us not be difficult about this. The facts are that the government has been forced to bring back this legislation in a new form without that part 7 which was objected to by us. That is a victory for the opposition but, more importantly, it is a victory for the veterans community, and that is what I am more pleased about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politics of it in the end do not matter a great deal; the important thing is that we can stand here today on this side of the House at least and say that this was a victory for the veterans community. I am very pleased that that is the case. The minister might want to try to argue his way out of that but I do not think he will be able to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister maintains that this bill reflects the government's continuing concern for the welfare of veterans and their dependants. As I have already pointed out, this was certainly not the case with the original bill. In fact, there are substantial residual doubts within the veterans community about the government's bona fides in respect of its treatment of veterans. In a sense, the new minister finds himself in a very hot seat indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insensitivity and thoughtlessness which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) displayed towards veterans during his recent trip to Vietnam has galvanised not only the veterans community but the general public as well. There was&mdash;quite understandably and correctly&mdash;a ground swell of opinion against the Prime Minister's behaviour and attitude in Vietnam on that recent trip. The increased numbers of people who turned out at the Anzac Day marches and observances around the country this year reflect the widespread support in the community for the ideals for which veterans fought and died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister demonstrated&mdash;for all veterans, not only Vietnam veterans&mdash;that he fails to understand that particular fact. To some extent, the minister now finds himself in the position of having to take on a task that in many respects might be seen as a lost cause, and that is to convince the veterans community that the government really genuinely cares about them. If it is not a lost cause, then it certainly is a very difficult one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has already been said, there is nothing in this bill that we find objectionable. I might take the opportunity of asking the minister something while he is here. I do not want to get diverted too much onto the budget, but the debate on veterans affairs generally today is timely. There are a number of issues which have been raised in the last 24 hours and, indeed, in the last couple of days, because there have been a number of very significant events which affect veterans. The first event was the release of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>, the so-called Baume report on compensation for veterans and war widows. This report, by and large, is very comprehensive and extremely helpful in clarifying a number of issues and setting the ground for debate on a number of issues in the area of veterans affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out another sorry event in the history of this government's treatment of veterans, and that was its reaction to the Bushell decision. I want the minister to make it very clear that that is now, as far as the government is concerned, a dead issue. Of course it is referred to in some detail in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS>, and I am very pleased that the Baume committee actually makes this statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not accept DVA's first stance of the flood gates opening with the advent of the Bushell case. We do accept that the endorsement of the interpretation by the High Court will lead to an increase in claims and success rates, and in the potential for exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA>That fact is reflected in the committee's recommendations. I want to make sure that the government absolutely accepts that that is now the position and that there will not be any further attempt to rush in, as indeed it did. It could hardly contain itself after the Bushell decision in the High Court. It rushed in here with legislation aimed at overcoming a court decision which was clearly beneficial to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government lost a great deal of credibility through that reaction. If it had only reacted to the Bushell case to adjust, in a sense, the decision that was made by the court, perhaps that might have been excusable or understandable. In fact, there was an attempt within that context to go way beyond the Bushell case: an attempt by the government not only to address the effect of the Bushell case directly but, in the view of the veterans community&mdash;and obviously that view prevailed, as it turned out&mdash;to effectively overturn the Bushell decision. I want the veterans community to be absolutely sure that the government now accepts the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not certain of that, as a result of having looked closely at the budget. The Baume committee recommended only one change, and that was that the standard of proof for operational service was to be reasonable satisfaction. That was to replace the test that existed, which was the reasonable hypothesis test. There is no mention yet about the government's reaction to that recommendation, although I take it that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The minister was helping me a little. I want him to make that absolutely sure. I take it then that the government's acceptance of the Baume committee's recommendation that an expert medical committee be established to resolve general medical issues and to formulate statements of principle for application or decision making has been accepted. It is not called that, as I see from the budget papers; it has been called a medical tribunal, and I think the minister has since given it some other name. I take it that that is the response to the Bushell case and that that is the end; that there will be no further attempt by the government to change the advantageous decision of the Bushell case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will not show that the minister is nodding his head in agreement, but when he replies he can put that on the record so we can all be quite sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not delay the debate much longer but I want to make the minister aware, if he is not already aware, of some residual concerns in the veterans community. There is still, with some justification, considerable suspicion or doubt about the government's long-term intentions in relation to the treatment of TPIs. The budget makes provision for the fact that the intermediate rate and the TPI rate will no longer be granted to veterans over 65 years of age, et cetera. But there is still concern in the veterans community that somehow the government's longer term intention is actually to take that disability pension from pensioners who already have it, those who have already turned 65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to make it absolutely clear to the veterans community that that is not the government's intention&mdash;not now, not tomorrow and not while he remains the minister or however far he can go towards giving a clear and unequivocal commitment on that particular point. That remains a concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important point that needs to be made in relation to disability pensions generally is that they are not welfare. There is some feeling generally that somehow they are welfare. They are not welfare; these pensions are the earned entitlements of veterans. They are compensation for illness, disability and other contributing factors. The point needs to be made that we are not talking about welfare; that we are talking about something veterans have earned. That is why some suggestion in the foreshadowing of the Baume report suggesting that veterans' benefits were somehow overgenerous, to use the word that came out at the time, indicated a misunderstanding or a misconstruction of what veterans entitlements are all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add to the remarks already made about Australian mariners. I congratulate the government on finally coming to that particular decision. We also welcome the proposals in respect of younger veterans and Vietnam veterans. The minister has made a number of announcements about the $20.6 million assistance package for younger veterans. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS> goes into considerable detail about health options for younger veterans. I am pleased that the government has noted most of that and particularly the comments about improvements to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again there is considerable suspicion within the Vietnam veterans community about the long-term intentions of the government in respect of the VVCS. I would like the minister to make absolutely clear now, today, without equivocation, that the government will continue to maintain the VVCS as a separate and independent entity and that in fact the VVCS is not under threat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because, as far as the Vietnam veterans community is concerned, there have been signs and signals that the government's intentions in this respect are otherwise. The Vietnam veterans welcome the fact that within the budget there will be increases in resources to enable expansion of the role of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. On the face of it that would seem to indicate quite clearly the government's long-term intentions. But things can change quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Vietnam veterans also welcome the reference in the budget to a mortality study of Vietnam veterans which will be conducted to ascertain the rate of death from all causes, particularly suicide and cancer. I asked the previous minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), a question on notice on 15 December 1993, only a few months back, about the death of a particular Vietnam veteran in Queensland. I went on to ask the Minister about the rate of deaths of Vietnam veterans. I asked him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . how many of the deaths have been attributed to (a) suicide or (b) suspected suicide?</PARA>
<PARA>The minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Department of Defence has advised that about 53,000 personnel either served, or were deemed allotted for service in Vietnam. My Department has estimated there to be about 49,600 surviving Vietnam veterans. This estimate is based on 501 deaths in action and about 2,900 deaths since 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Of the total number of deaths reported to the Department, 176 have been classified as deaths from suicide or self-inflicted injury. Five deaths have been classified as `undetermined . . . `</PARA>
<PARA>The Vietnam veterans with whom I have discussed this hotly dispute those figures. In fact, they asked the government&mdash;and the minister might take this on notice for a future time&mdash;how it arrived at those figures. There is a suspicion&mdash;and I implied it in my question&mdash;that, in fact, there are many more than 2,900 Vietnam veterans that have died since 1973. There is a very strong suspicion&mdash;but only on an anecdotal basis&mdash;that the number of suicides is very much in excess of 176. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the government some credit for setting up the mortality study of the Vietnam veterans, and I take it that that study results from questions such as mine. It will have a close look not only at the suicide rate&mdash;in my electorate there have been some Vietnam veteran suicides&mdash;but also at the question of deaths from cancer and other related illnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate the opportunity to make a few broader comments on veterans affairs in the context of this bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;First of all, let me acknowledge that I am well aware of the personal interest in matters relating to our community of veterans, as espoused certainly by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and indeed the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). I have taken on board the comments that have been made, particularly with respect to the question of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service. The Leader of the National Party may remember that I was a member of the House of Representatives committee chaired by my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) back in 1988 or thereabouts. The Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms McHugh) was also on the committee. We looked at the adequacy or otherwise of the services of the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to assure the honourable member for McPherson that, rather than wanting to wind down the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, we are going to beef it up. In fact, if he reads the budget documents carefully, he will see that. I accept the fact that there has not been much time to read them. Vietnam veterans can rest assured that there are certainly no thoughts in my mind or in the mind of the government to get rid of the counselling service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not want to say too much on this bill, and I particularly do not want to say too much with respect to the budget announcements of last night. As was correctly stated by the Leader of the National Party, we will be able to discuss and debate those issues at a later time when that legislation comes in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a number of points on this bill. It is true that this bill could have been used as a double dissolution trigger. I feel somewhat surprised in many respects that the opposition would claim this as a victory. Let me tell the House exactly what the position is with this bill. The fact is that this bill was passed by this House but rejected by the Senate on the basis that there was a section of it, part 7 of the old bill, which related to managed investments. The opposition has this rule which, in a stubborn sort of a way, it will not change. If there are any bills that come before the Senate which relate to or have anything in them to do with managed investments or shares, it refuses to let them go through. So it did the same thing with this bill, notwithstanding that the changes in part 7 of the old bill in so far as it related to managed investments were beneficial changes. That was the funny thing: they were beneficial changes. Nevertheless, at the end of the day, the reality remained that the bill did not go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government could quite easily have been cynical about this. But when I took over the veterans affairs ministry one of the first matters that came to my attention was the fact that on 1 July 1994 some 200,000 social security pensioners would end up with a Commonwealth seniors health card as a result of legislation which I introduced some time ago in another capacity. But, because this bill had not gone through, some 10,000 veterans and their dependants would miss out on this Commonwealth seniors health card. It was therefore then my decision, as the new minister, on what I wanted to do with this. As I said, we could have quite easily been cynical about it. We could have quite easily used the opportunity, if that was what was in our minds, to do exactly that and use this as a double dissolution trigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have reintroduced this bill not because it is a victory that can be claimed by the coalition, or a victory that I claim either, but because it is a victory for those 10,000 veterans and their dependants who, come 1 July 1994, will receive their Commonwealth seniors health card from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. They are the winners out of all of this. I am surprised that the coalition would want to be crass enough to claim some sort of victory. The end result is this: as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I refuse to allow these 10,000 veterans and their dependants to be used as pawns in a political game played by the opposition. It is for that reason, and that reason alone, that I have introduced this bill, minus part 7, the way it was before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can look the honourable member for McPherson and the Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Farrer, in the eye and say to them that this was a decision which I took, and I can assure them that no-one tried to talk me out of it. So it can be seen that the intentions of the government on this were very pure. I will not claim credit for it; the government will not claim credit for it; but opposition members should not claim credit for it either. It is very crass of them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the National Party and the member for McPherson raised the question of the initiatives that were in the budget last night. I will not go into them in any detail, but the Leader of the National Party did say, I think, that he intends to let the ex-service community know of the small print in the budget. By all means let him do that, because I have let them know&mdash;Senator Faulkner, my predecessor in this job, has been talking with them for months and months&mdash;what our intentions are. Rather than telling honourable members on the other side of the House myself and getting the reaction that that is just the government talking, let me read from a press release that was put out last night by the very well respected president of the Returned Services League, Major General Digger James. I do not think that anyone can possibly say that Major General Digger James is a pawn of any government. The press release headed, `1994 budget good deal for vets' said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994 Budget has good news for veterans, in particular the rejection of central planks in the recent Baume report, RSL National President Major General Digger James said tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In particular we are pleased the Government has rejected Professor Baume's recommendation that the standard of proof now applied to assessing compensation claims be diluted to the civil standard", Major General James said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This would have been contrary to the whole ethos of our system and we congratulate the government for standing firm against it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Equally, we are pleased at the rejection of any suggestion that veterans are no more than just another group of welfare recipients. To this end we congratulate the Government for transferring war widows and widowers support pensions from social security to the DVA."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major General James said the new Repatriation Medical Authority which was being set up to streamline the vexed question of the causal relationship between veterans' diseases and injuries and war service was also welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This initiative has resulted from extensive consultation between the former Minister Senator Faulkner and the present Minister Mr Sciacca and veterans", Major General James said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"If it is successful&mdash;and we believe it will be&mdash;it will help solve a problem which has plagued Repatriation since its inception and, since the opening of the system to the courts in the late 1970s, resulted in hugely expensive legal cases." He said he was pleased, too, that the Government had rejected Baume's quite unnecessary recommendations for restructuring TPI and War Widows' pensions.</PARA>
<PARA>The final paragraph says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Overall, this is a very reasonable Budget indeed as far as we are concerned. The pre-Budget consultative processes with both ministers were exemplary and we look forward to continuing monitoring processes to ensure the intent of the new measures is fulfilled".</PARA>
<PARA>I read that because really this is a bipartisan situation&mdash;I am sure it can be. I am sure that we will end up getting the approval of the opposition for the full measure because this is a package deal. Almost if not all of what we might save as a result of any perceived tightening up of conditions will be put back into the veterans community by virtue of the more than $20 million package for the Vietnam veterans and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can talk about it at a later stage, but I can assure the Leader of the National Party of Australia that just about everything that is in this budget has been passed by the veterans community. Indeed, when we arrange to appoint the medical tribunal, even the names of the people that I would consider appointing will be passed by the Vietnam Veterans Association, the RSL, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to a bipartisan approach from the Leader of the National Party of Australia because I know that he will look at it. At the end of the day this is one of those situations where we say to the opposition, `You can't have the goodies with this without the baddies, because I can't pay for the goodies without the things which you would consider as the baddies but which the RSL certainly does not consider as being bad.'</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 applies only to pensioners who are required to provide a tax file number. If the individual pensioner category has been exempted from providing a tax file number, part 7 does not apply.</PARA>

<PARA>In other words, as in the Leonard Teale case, which was brought up by the Leader of the National Party of Australia, the position is that the secretary may decide that, if a person is in receipt of no other income or benefit from social security, receives only a disability pension of some sort and does not come near the government for anything else, he or she is exempt from the requirement, and this bill does not change that position. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports strongly the proposal to have a labelling scheme which, while not being overly burdensome to industry, makes it easier for consumers who want very much to support Australian industry to be able to ascertain the sources of products. The scheme proposed under the bill provides for labels on products making a claim about their Australianness. The first type of label would read `Produce of Australia' or `Product of Australia'. This would apply where Australia was the place of origin of each major ingredient or component of the goods and all operations involved in the manufacture or production of the goods happened in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second type of label would read `Made in Australia'. This would apply to goods which acquired their essential character or qualities in Australia. The third type of label would read `Assembled'&mdash;or `packed' or `sewn', or some similar verb&mdash;`in Australia from imported components'. That is self-explanatory. In addition, the bill contemplates that goods that carry a representation likely to be regarded as an Australian origin representation&mdash;for example, a kangaroo or a koala, the Australian flag or a map of Australia&mdash;must also carry information about the actual origin of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns need to be addressed, and they make a committee inquiry entirely appropriate. The description `Made in Australia'&mdash;meaning that the goods acquired their essential character in Australia&mdash;is not specific and could in fact apply to goods all of whose ingredients came from overseas. This description also raises questions as to the relationship of the first two categories, that is the distinction between `produced' and `made' in Australia. There is a potential problem of mislabelling occurring due to seasonal supply problems, such as a major ingredient going out of supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The definition of a major ingredient or component, in the `Produce/product of Australia' descriptor, is not specified. The government has said that guidelines will be developed but, plainly, they have not yet been prepared or tabled. The proposed section 65VJ and section 65VK cover the use of the Australian origin representations&mdash;the kangaroos, flags and maps, et cetera&mdash;and require that the foreign origin representation be as prominent as the Australian connection representation, and that the representations be as close to each other as possible. Debate could obviously ensue as to what is `prominent' and what is `close'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition thanks the minister for agreeing to refer the bill to the committee. The House is to be commended for its third decision to refer a bill to a standing committee. It is the first reference of a bill to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the two previous references being to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The coalition members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology have advised me that they are keen to ensure that the committee's report is tabled with expedition, and the coalition looks forward to the report. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are indeed happy to try to address any of these concerns, just as we have been happy to address every concern that has been raised during the 18-month discussion of this bill that we have had with the community and with industry. It is in that very same spirit of cooperation that has been the hallmark of the bill so far that I am happy to refer it to that committee even though, unfortunately, it was only at noon yesterday that we discovered that the opposition still had some concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want people to understand that the intentions of the bill are only to end the confusion, which will in itself be a great benefit to industry and consumers. The bill will support industry and therefore jobs. It will also give industry 12 months to cooperatively develop the guidelines for the scheme to which the honourable member referred and to change existing labels. The guidelines cannot be prepared until the legislation is through. The guidelines are to be developed with industry, at industry's request, for its assistance. One of the responsibilities of my bureau is to assist industry to comply with the law, and the means of doing this is to develop guidelines that help suppliers to be fully aware of their obligations and responsibilities under the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for matters like seasonal variations that the honourable member referred to, it is important that the legislation set rules that are as definite as possible and that will not mislead consumers. For instance, `Product of Australia' means virtually `all Australian'. If the legislation did deal with all the possible permutations that might arise in practice, it would have to set different percentage levels of Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked into the possibility of doing all that sort of thing, but then suppliers would still move between levels and have to relabel as the source of the ingredients changed. Such legislation would be very complex and certainly harder to enforce than the type of legislation I am proposing. All the matters that are being raised anywhere at all by industry, by consumer groups, by anyone in the community, are being addressed and have been addressed. The consultation has been extraordinary so far, with over 5,000 pieces of correspondence. </PARA>

Anyone who has come with a concern has had that concern&mdash;for the most part, I believe&mdash;dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The groups are satisfied to the extent that many industries are already switching over to the terms that we propose.

<PARA>This bill is part of the package of legislation to implement the 1993-94 budget decision to impose a charge on industry to support the continental margins program conducted by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, AGSO. The charge, which will be imposed on petroleum and minerals exploration permits and retention leases offshore under Commonwealth jurisdiction, will recover approximately one half of the cost of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will enable charges to be appropriated from the consolidated revenue fund to support the program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government commissioned an independent review of AGSO in 1992 led by Dr Max Richards, known as the Richards review, to enhance Australia's geoscience effort. The review panel, which included senior members of the petroleum and minerals industries, carefully examined AGSO's operations. The review's report contained a wide range of recommendations, which have been carefully considered by the government. The continental margins program was identified by the review as essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of the continental margins program are to provide geoscientific information and advice in order to improve offshore petroleum and mineral exploration efficiency and effectiveness. The program also supports government decision making on offshore petroleum and mineral exploration and development. Other objectives of the program are to sustain Australia's legal continental shelf claim and to support intergovernmental negotiations on the delineation of seabed boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Richards review argued that geoscientific work undertaken by AGSO through the continental margins program should by fully funded by government. The government's view is that, where there are community benefits, the community should pay. Where the industry benefits, the industry should pay. Where benefits are shared, costs should be shared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's decision to raise approximately $10 million from the offshore exploration industry to fund about half the cost of the continental margins program, commencing in 1994-95, is based on the principle that the program benefits both the industry and the community. Therefore, both should contribute to its funding. The data and ideas flowing from the program have been of benefit to companies in their exploration programs. The charge will be applied to exploration permits and retention leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date the continental margins program has focused on activities related to petroleum. Hence the charge will initially be levied only on the petroleum industry. Based on the current number of permits and leases, a charge of around $100,000 per title will be applied. Should the program, in consultation with industry, be extended to research of interest to the minerals industry, a charge will be applied to minerals exploration and retention licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is committed to ensuring that the work of AGSO, including this program, remains relevant to both industry and community needs. AGSO has thus been directed to consult fully with the industry in the development of, and reporting on, its programs. This will enable industry priorities to be taken into account. The program will be subject to evaluation in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also make a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to improve efficiency in administration.

This amendment will streamline procedures for access authorities without affecting the rights of other parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also clarifies that the companies rather than the regulatory authorities should accept ultimate liability for their operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of mineral and petroleum bills before the House will impose a new tax on the petroleum and minerals industries operating in the offshore zone. The offshore area includes the continental shelf and territorial sea. The government's intention is that $10 million per annum be raised by this new taxation measure. This revenue will constitute about half the cost of the continental margins program as conducted by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, AGSO, formerly known as the Bureau of Mineral Resources. The continental margins program began in 1983. It was designed to research the structure and the evolution of Australia's continental plateaus and adjacent ocean basins, as well as the exclusive economic zone. The program provides a geological framework for hydrocarbon and mineral resource exploration and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation now under consideration will require companies holding exploration or retention permits for the offshore area to pay an annual fee. It is worth noting that an exploration permit allows the holder to explore for petroleum in a specific area of offshore Australia, while a retention lease allows for further investigation of a discovery to occur and plans for production to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially, the tax will be zero for the minerals industry as the continental margins program does not yet address the shallow water geophysical work required by the offshore minerals industry for exploration. The petroleum industry will initially, therefore, provide the full $10 million through a charge on each offshore exploration or retention permit of around $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as the program focuses further on this work in the future, the government will increase the tax and include the offshore minerals industry. The intention is that the tax on the petroleum industry will decrease over time as the offshore minerals industry makes more use of the continental margins program and the charge for offshore minerals permits is correspondingly increased. In this way, the taxation measure will continue to be $10 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the government attempts to dress up this new tax as a user charge nothing could be further from the truth. It is a new taxation measure and bears no similarity to the concept of user charge. How can it, when the government sets the charge at $10 million per annum, and it does not matter whether there are 100 licence holders or retention permit holders or 1,000? That $10 million is still the set fee. It is an insult to the intelligence of the honourable members of this parliament, let alone the participants in the industry, to try to pretend this is a user charge. If there is a variable number of payers of the set amount, that means that the payer is not paying according to usage. There will be a set $10 million and each year there will be a different number of people contributing to that $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $10 million does not come down to $5 million one year and then up to $15 million according to the amount of information provided under the continental margins program. It is utterly dishonest on any assessment of user charge to claim that the $10 million is anything other than a tax. User charging requires that the user of a service be charged for the provision of that service and for no other service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, the seismic data provided to companies gaining exploration permits will not reflect the cost of provision of that data. The fact that they are holders of exploration permits immediately means that they have to pay $100,000 a year not $50,000 because they use less than another company which should be charged $200,000. There is no nexus between usage of the information provided and the charge applied to the company. Instead, under the legislation, the cost will be based on the number of years the permit is held with a rate of $100,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies gaining an exploration permit will already have gained any possible benefit from the continental margins program data. On gaining the permit they will start paying $100,000 per year for seismic work that does not apply to their exploration permit. It is crystal clear: you pay $100,000, supposedly for data provided under the program, and then you pay $100,000 the next year and $100,000 the year after and the year after, and so on. Talk about double dipping! This is triple dipping and more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the information provided is related to the $100,000, then why do applicants not pay it when they gain the exploration permit? Why is it a renewable charge year in, year out? Why are they paying twice or four or five times for the same amount of data that was provided in the first year? The simple answer is that it is a tax. It is not a user charge. Realistically, user charging requires that if services cease to be provided then the charges should cease. If companies have paid for the information once, they should not have to pay for it several times over. That is not a user charge. It would be a user charge if the information provided was purchased once only. This legislation is going to require companies to continue paying $100,000 per year for so long as they hold the permit. As permits can be renewed indefinitely for five-year periods, the payments will extend far beyond any reasonable concept of user charging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, allow me to stress that user charging requires that the charge rate should reflect the cost of providing the service received by the customer. None of the commonsense definitions of user charging apply to the proposal put forward by the government for the offshore petroleum and mineral industries. This is a smokescreen for a straight tax grab which has left the industry embittered. The primary objective of the continental margins program should be to increase the amount of petroleum and mineral exploration on Australia's continental shelf by providing pre-competitive seismic information to potential explorers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, `pre-competitive' means that the seismic data generated does not indicate suitable sites for offshore oil wells but rather indicates geological structures which may include suitable drilling sites once further and more detailed seismic investigation is undertaken by the companies holding the exploration permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government uses the seismic information obtained under the continental margins program to determine appropriate permit areas to release for exploration. Thus, the program is an important element in attracting minerals and petroleum investment to Australia's offshore areas. This is clearly a government responsibility. If the Australian government does not undertake the pre-competitive work&mdash;the base line research necessary to attract significant investment in petroleum and minerals exploration in Australia&mdash;then it is Australia which suffers. The petroleum and minerals industries will not suffer, as they will simply move to countries that view petroleum and minerals exploration more favourably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my discussions with the industry it has been made abundantly clear that the industry would prefer not having the continental margins program to paying for it in the way proposed by the legislation. Does the minister understand that? The industry does not make commercial use of the continental margins program. Let us have transparent and unambiguous user charges in regard to the continental margins program. Try selling data to the industry. It does not want it. It will do its own seismic data collection rather than pay for information which is not of crucial use to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has to answer this very simple point: if the program is of commercial benefit, as the minister in his second reading speech would have us believe, then why is the industry vowing to abandon the continental margins program rather than pay for it? The Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall) said in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the program benefits both the industry and the community. Therefore, both should contribute to its funding.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us test it. If the minister thinks the program is of benefit to industry, then charge industry for it, voluntarily, and see if industry takes it up. It will not. The minister goes on to say in his second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data and ideas flowing from the program have been of benefit to companies in their exploration programs.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, test it; test it. Make it a voluntary user charge and the industry will call your bluff. This is a compulsory contribution to the work of AGSO supposedly in the form of user charge but what in reality is a new tax. I think it is going to have very serious consequences for the relationship in the future between AGSO and the industry. I must say that I too am developing something of a jaundiced view of AGSO over this particular issue and over another which I will refer to shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said in his second reading speech that the community benefits from the continental margins program. Unquestionably. There is no doubt about that. As far as it is a public good program, the government should fully fund it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going to hold the government to its claim that the program benefits industry. It is drawing a very long bow to claim that industry benefits from the program when the industry has said it does not want the program. Could anything be more clear? It is so obvious that this government is misleading the parliament in claiming that this is a user charge. The consequences are very serious for the investment climate as well as for the industry's relationship with AGSO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community clearly benefits from the continental margins program because Australia is a more attractive place to invest in as a result&mdash;and hence more jobs and more export income are created. The industry benefits from the program in that baseline exploratory work only has been done. It is totally misleading for the minister to claim that the industry benefits to the tune of $10 million from the continental margins program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program indicates to the government which permit areas can be released for exploration. Let us also make very clear that the government benefits directly from the program because it raises revenue from knowing which areas in offshore Australia to release for exploration and development. So the government is going to have to do the continental margins program, perhaps not in its totality as at present, and perhaps the government has to tailor the continental margins program to be truly commercial for its own purposes, but do not pretend that it is the industry which needs the continental margins program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's interest is financial because it needs the program to give it that baseline information about hydrocarbon deposits and geological structures and the like so as to release areas for exploration. But there is also the larger national interest issue of developing Australia's resources. A failure by the government to fund the continental margins program in some form and the consequent failure to attract investment may well result in the dwindling of jobs and export income that these industries provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mining and petroleum industry leaders have made it perfectly clear recently that they are lifting their sights to overseas prospects as the difficulties of conducting business in the resources sector in Australia increase. At present Australia enjoys over 80 per cent self-sufficiency in oil production. However, that degree of security will change disastrously without sufficient incentives to engage in the high-risk business of discovering fresh reserves. The government has a duty to the community to make Australia an attractive place for resources investment. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Richards review argued that geoscientific work undertaken by AGSO through the continental margins program should be fully funded by government.

<PARA>I can see the minister's point: it does not lock the Richards review into outright support of the user charges proposed by the legislation but it certainly does not express the published view of Dr Max Richards that these user charges are outrageous and detrimental to the interests of one industry.

Suddenly the government needs funding, so it plucks a figure of external earnings of 50 per cent out of the air and applies it to industry. How does that make CSIRO and other publicly funded institutions feel? Well, I can tell honourable members that I have spoken to them and they are pretty scared. This is an extremely dangerous precedent because, if the government can apply a 50 per cent industry funding requirement on the fundamental work of the continental margins program, it can do it to any other publicly funded research institution. It flies in the face of the government's own support for appropriations to public good research. CSIRO, ANSTO, AIMS and other publicly funded research institutions are particularly concerned about environmental and natural resource related programs which find it very difficult and, in some cases, impossible to attract industry funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, I want to comment on the matter of AGSO's external funding requirements as it relates to the detail of government plans for the continental margins program. Unfortunately, I must remind the House that I have got numerous questions on notice lying unanswered for seven months or more. The question I filed on 16 December had 32 parts to it and much of it related to the government's attitude to the continental margins program and the role of AGSO, so I can understand that the government would neatly and conveniently avoid answering that question on 16 December and wait for the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is no excuse whatsoever for the government not answering my question filed on 21 October 1993, which had 24 parts to it. In it I tried to find out how AGSO is going to meet the 30 per cent external funding requirement imposed on it by government. What is its business plan? How is it going to structure its operations to be commercially attractive so as to convince industry, which takes a very hard-nosed view on these matters, to contribute 30 per cent to its funding? I must warn the minister that, if he wants the support of the opposition for organisations such as AGSO, he needs to take us somewhat more seriously. I have grave doubts that AGSO is in any position to restructure itself and to prepare itself to be industry relevant so as to attract 30 per cent of its funding. And to a large extent it has got my sympathy; it is no easy matter. As shadow minister for science and technology for four years, I saw a whole range of other research institutions grapple with this enormous problem of meeting the very high external funding requirement expected of them. But you must involve the opposition, Minister, so that we are confident that AGSO is making the attempt. I have seen examples over the 1980s where institutions dragged their heels in meeting these external funding targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be some degree of confusion within the government or within AGSO if it cannot answer for several months those questions relating to its external earnings program. I think this ill-conceived legislation is a direct result of that confusion. But it must not be allowed to set a precedent for future opportunist measures by this government. The petroleum and offshore minerals industry's needs from the government are quite simple. As resources projects take many years to mature, with most of the expense outlaid before income is received, governments should not change the rules at any point through a project for some short-term financial or political gain. Industry investors must have the confidence that the many years of initial expense will be paid for when the product produces income. The past actions of governments have an important effect on the perceptions of the industry and investors. The Labor Party might consider that the big resource controversies of past years like Coronation Hill are gone, but they are not forgotten. The three mines uranium policy will never be forgotten while it arbitrarily restricts jobs and export income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that vein, the legislation before the House will extract an extra $100,000 per year for the privilege of holding a retention licence and will make an investment in offshore petroleum or minerals less attractive. The government should not introduce an additional charge after the decision to invest in development and production has been made. Those oil investors who have waited through the long years and high risks of exploration and were rewarded with a successful strike are now enduring the development phase before production occurs, and they now find that, without warning, this new tax will absorb a further proportion of the long-awaited profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of this tax on top of existing charges leads inescapably to the conclusion that the government is determined to meet its budgetary requirements with an extra $10 million from the resources sector and it does not really care how this affects the petroleum industry. It is not as if the petroleum industry does not already pay its fair share of taxes. In addition to the usual company tax, fringe benefits tax and sales tax, the resources rent tax will cost the industry $1.3 billion this financial year. Additionally, petroleum products excise will produce a massive $9.7 billion for the government this financial year. The petroleum industry underpins our way of life in many diverse ways and provides an enormous contribution to government revenue. The government should be encouraging the industry, not imposing new taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this legislation on the holders of retention leases is minor compared to the effect on petroleum exploration. This legislation will discourage exploration. The minister has personally assured me by way of a written explanation of the legislation in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not believe this charge will constitute a significant impediment to offshore exploration.</PARA>
<PARA>Despite this the charges per permit for the petroleum industry will decrease as the charges on the minerals industry increase, as it begins to use the continental margins program data. So when the embryonic offshore minerals industry begins to utilise the continental margins program&mdash;not that it will choose to but it has no choice&mdash;and starts paying for exploration permits and licences and the like, so the petroleum industry's costs per permit and licence will come down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a great user charge that is. We have covered the user charge argument, but that is just another argument against how this cannot possibly be called a user charge. Moreover, this decrease in the petroleum industry's cost in the years to come as the offshore minerals industry takes off is proof that the government knows it is a disincentive. If it were not a disincentive to exploration and development, the government would keep the charge on. The government is in a hurry&mdash;it is very eager&mdash;to lessen the impact on the petroleum industry as the years go on by including the minerals industry as a contributor to the payment towards a continental margins program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the minister cannot claim, as he tries to, that the costs associated with the permits and licences are not a disincentive to exploration and development. A properly structured tax with a justifiable basis would not need to be phased out in a furtive manner. Of course, this raises the likelihood that the government will break its promise to reduce the tax for the petroleum industry and continue to unfairly tax an already burdened industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we must take the minister and the government at its word. The government has said the petroleum industry will be paying less in the future, depending on to what extent the offshore minerals industry takes off, but it does worry people that it may not hold to that. Again, the minister has said that the more licences or the more permits, the less the amount that attaches to each of them. Wow! And that is a user charge? I do not think so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that is a user charge at all. Given that an offshore exploration well costs up to $10 million, the cost of retaining the associated exploration permit will now be at least one per cent per year of the well cost. I genuinely am convinced that that will eat away at the opportunities for companies to drill further wells. It is a significant impost, particularly when only one in 12 wells drilled is successful. So this new tax will discourage the small companies which often prove up an area for later investment by the big players.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must not become complacent about the self-sufficiency in oil we have enjoyed in the past.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no member of the House be under any illusion. This is a revenue grab; it is not a user charge. I believe that the minister must act very quickly to restore the worsening relations between the industry and AGSO.

The opposition strongly opposes the legislation and will continue to do so in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite happy to have a private conversation with the honourable member for Gippsland at any time. It is with pleasure that I support this legislation. It is a package which will enable the 1993-94 budget provisions to be implemented concerning the continental margins program conducted by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. The continental margins program is an extremely important one, as the honourable member agrees. It is a very important element in Australia's strategy to encourage exploration for, and the development of, Australia's offshore petroleum and gas resources. Its primary objective is to increase the amount of exploration on Australia's continental shelf by providing pre-competitive geoseismic information and advice. The information it provides is aimed at improving perceptions of prospectivity and, ultimately, attracting exploration activity to Australian waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program also will support government decision making on offshore petroleum and mineral exploration. It will sustain Australia's legal continental shelf claim and provide support for intergovernmental negotiations on the delineation of seabed boundaries. It provides an invaluable source of baseline data which can be used&mdash;and, indeed, is currently used&mdash;to assess environmental impacts and sensitivities in Australian marine environments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such an important program requires adequate funding, and that is what this legislation is all about. A necessary administrative adjunct to the legislation is to allow cancellation of titles for non-payment of user charges. In other words, if someone decides to take out a licence over an area and then proceeds not to pay the contribution the rights to it are forfeited&mdash;and so they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The user charges announced in the 1993-94 budget followed the government decision that approximately half the cost&mdash;about $10 million&mdash;of the continental margins program should be funded by the offshore petroleum and minerals industries. Funds from these industries will be raised through an annual charge placed on the holders of Commonwealth offshore petroleum and mineral exploration permits and licences and retention leases or licences. That is the proper way it should go: revenue raised should go back into research. I am not suggesting that this is the only level of research that will be carried out in future. Surely it is in the interests of exploration that the government be allowed to upgrade the services that it provides. One of the differences between the present government and previous governments of Australia is that we are looking to the future. At this stage, the activities of the continental margins programs are concerned with petroleum rather than minerals and therefore the user charge on minerals exploration and retention licences will be set at zero. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has come about because the government wanted to respond to the 1993 Richards review of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. The Richards review was very thorough. It was an independent report on the operations of the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. Its recommendations have been very carefully considered by the government, and special consideration was given to the recommendation that the geoscientific work undertaken by AGSO should be funded by government and that funding in 1996-97 should be increased. In this way the continental margins program can continue to improve the organisation's responsiveness and accountability in serving both national and industry needs. An additional 30 per cent external funding target, exclusive of the user charge, was set for AGSO's geoscientific services to ensure that these are provided. There is also a need for an extra $1.5 million per annum for the national mapping accord to enhance the pace of its implementation so that there can be an added incentive to encourage greater state participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us go to one of the points that the opposition continues to make: industry does not want to purchase this information. Why would industry want to purchase the information if it is being given free? I would like honourable members opposite to identify a single user-pays charge&mdash;or tax, as they insist on calling this charge&mdash;that is friendly. I would like them to identify one single tax that they pay willingly. They know they cannot. There is no such thing; it has never been devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the amounts paid by petroleum explorers and producers in Australia to the Australian government are large, I do not notice any of those companies wishing to reduce their charges. I wonder whether the next speaker is going to identify how much BHP paid to go to South Vietnam for a right to explore in the ocean there and what was the deal done with the Vietnamese government if BHP is successful in discovering petroleum there. I wonder how it compares with the user-pays charges that this legislation is introducing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the order of $2.5 million was paid for AGSO's services in 1992-93 and $2 million so far in the first half of 1993-94. From 1987 to the end of 1993, sales have totalled $5.8 million. That is as exploration is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have great pleasure in supporting this legislation. It is a worthwhile program and a commonsense program. Obviously, the more information we have, the better equipped we are to care for the environment, and the information we can offer explorers is more worthwhile and valuable. I would like to point out that the amendment that allows the cancellation of titles if companies do not pay the charges within three months is consistent with existing provisions allowing cancellation for non-payment of other fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to honourable members. It is sensible. It puts in place the means by which the excellent functions of AGSO can be continued and, indeed, expanded. </PARA>

He referred to a group of cliches and grab bags. I wish the honourable member were entitled to a supplementary response. If he were, he might tell us what relevance they have to an argument about how the government should levy a tax or charge against the oil industry for providing a service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no conflict on the issue of user pays. The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), the shadow spokesman, did not put up an argument that the oil industry should necessarily pay nothing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition and industry are saying in the first instance that if there is to be a charge, let it be, firstly, for a worthwhile service, secondly, for that component of the service for which the purchaser sees value and, thirdly, one which the purchaser can afford. This is our great problem with this government's move to the implementation of the user pays principle. Had the honourable member for Paterson stayed, I am sure he would be reminded of our participation in the subject of the quarantine services. For years, industry got a service for nothing and did not give a damn about its efficiency or any aspect of it until the government commenced collecting 100 per cent or thereabouts of its cost. Suddenly, industry became very interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that when it was still arguing about the effectiveness of industry in the meat substitution royal commission I gave evidence pointing out then and there that it was the responsibility of government not to provide the service with whatever inefficiencies that government usually manages to create but to supervise the service in this instance and let the charge be directly applicable to the consumer; in this case, it was the meatworks. I do not want to spend too long on what might seem an irrelevant aspect of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In this other debate, the honourable member for Paterson was representing himself as a cattle breeder; he probably is. Today he is representing himself as a one-time geologist; he probably was. When he is defeated at the next election, I do not know which job he will go back to, but in each case he has a problem, because people want to charge him more than they used to for services that his industry gained some benefit from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Gippsland was not saying that there is not necessarily an available benefit in these services. We are saying that the means by which the government has chosen to apply the charge is, to put it in the simplest terms, silly and not very smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area where I find myself having an interest&mdash;I have had to write on this very matter&mdash;is the International Wool Secretariat. Quite properly, having created a huge asset in the woolmark, it has said to those who get value from putting it on their clothing&mdash;it is on my suit&mdash;that they should pay something for it. That is a good idea. But just as this legislation provides, it has proposed a flat fee of $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, some poor little backyard operator trying to produce a product and promote this expansion that the government is so desperate for the business sector to provide in order to save it has to come up with a fee of $7,000 in the case of the woolmark. That is a huge sum of money for some very small operator to get the right to put the woolmark on a product. Because of the efforts of the IWS, people in many foreign countries just will not buy woollen products without it. When those opposite re-enter the debate, that point will prove pretty handy for me. I reckon that I am doing pretty well here on my own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that, with the licensing system in the wool industry, the same thing has been done here&mdash;a flat fee has been applied. The biggest Italian suit maker in the world will pay $7,000, the smallest&mdash;and, of course, this is probably a fair comparison&mdash;Australian company trying to develop a niche market in wool will also pay $7,000. I have written to the IWS and said that the idea sounds silly, and I hope that it is changed. The charge should somehow reflect the size of the operation and presumably the magnitude of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, to say that the amount in this instance will be $10 million and will be divided by the number of tenement holders at this point in time is silly. It should not be done that way. Secondly, government today recognises its role. It decided, because of an accident of history&mdash;originally government saw its role quite differently&mdash;that if we ever wanted one oil well in Australia it would go out and survey land from time to time with whatever technology was available and provide the sorts of survey maps that the honourable member for Paterson referred to. I well remember when we had no wells and I well remember when we had the first one that looked like being something at Rough Range near Carnarvon, where I live, and the great excitement associated with it. The government thought that, having done so, maybe someone would come along with the then tens or hundreds of millions of dollars needed and be encouraged to look a bit further. That was what the government set out to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things have changed over time for many reasons. We are now recognised as a highly prospective area of the world in terms of any form of minerals. So prospecting companies come knocking at our door. Government has hung in there basically now as a business. It has a status in business that I would dearly love to have. It can stand in this place and tell people how much it will pay.

It was interesting because the honourable member for Paterson said, `It's a great help to me. I'm a geologist. I can go in and see all this for nothing.' But under this proposal he is still going to see it for nothing. If he is as lucky as the American geologist that discovered oil in Bass Strait and got a massive royalty payment out of it, he would still be out of it.

Why not? He will make up his mind whether he needs it or not. Of course that is fair and reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, we have to spread this fee so that it is in some way applicable to the value of the tenement. I have mentioned Bass Strait. I do not think anybody was too keen on having some tenements in Bass Strait until Mr Weeks, an American geologist, came along and said to Esso and BHP, `If I were you I would go down there and look.' A lot of these tenements are pretty risky. People sit on them, and they just might become the greatest source of product of all. But we are now going to impose another charge which is not relevant to the prospectivity of the area; it will drive people off these tenements. The suggestion is that there is a massive queue waiting behind them to take their place. Well, at an extra hundred grand a year, I am not sure there is. Those tenements might be abandoned and become a desert of productivity&mdash;not very smart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Paterson suddenly threw in the fact that there is another role&mdash;protection of the environment. That is a highly beneficial role, but it is not the role of the tenement holder. That is the role of government in the public interest, so let the public pay. If we are talking about protection of the environment and all the other peripheral issues, let the government pay; let the people pay. That is a proper and important role. But we are not talking about doing that; we are talking about dividing into $10 million a certain number of tenements and making them all pay the same. That is silly. </PARA>

A piece of legislation can be brought back into this place which is user pays and which reflects the prospectivity or the productivity of the tenement and which, better still, reflects the value of the product, the service provided and the charges that will be levied. I think that is simple. I had a bit of a grin when the member for Paterson said, `They mightn't want it' and then paused before he said, `but they are going to get it.' That was a bit of humour.

The uncertainty of Mabo: if we take the black and white issues out of it, there is grave uncertainty and there are grave questions over the federal legislation as to how long it might take to get approvals through. People are saying to us, `We think it's easier to go overseas.' There is good reason, too. Other parts of the world are becoming a lot more attractive&mdash;politically, culturally and economically&mdash;places we would not dream of going to for fear of being shot up and imprisoned where we were just told, `Don't come, you're free enterprise and we're communist.' All that is changing. Australia has to be aware of that when the government comes in with proposals of this nature that just might be the final political straw that breaks the exploration or investment camel's back. I think that is very important and, again, good reason for the opposition to stand here and oppose this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, where does it all end up if there is a successful discovery and more oil is produced? Is the explorer going to say, `Well, I'm a genuine, compassionate person, I'm going to charge this much for my product; I'm not going to worry about the fact that the federal government has just loaded 100 grand on me'? Or is the explorer going to pass that 100 grand off? Is it going to go into the cost structure of the entire chain right down to the fuel bowser where, of course, the budget is collecting another $1 billion this year also? Of course it will. That is another reason why the opposition thinks that this proposal should not proceed. It is a cost of that nature. But, if it were just a cost for a service, business would make its own decisions. It would decide on the value of it, and it would choose to use such information that would save it money by doing the same work itself. That is the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that primarily covers the issue as the coalition sees it. We do not think the proposal is appropriate in its delivery, but we do not generally oppose the concept of user pays. It is a pity that the government, in so many other areas where it is putting this user-pays component on, does not remain or continue to remain the sole provider of the service. That is the problem. There is no competition in AQIS. Government should right the rules. It should, through AQIS, license providers who could be competitive in the marketplace instead of having one charge of this nature. I completely support the argument put forward by the shadow minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;The shadow minister, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), raised the issue of a couple of questions he had on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> prior to my becoming the minister. I will investigate today why they were not answered. I am not aware of them, particularly the one in October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened with great interest to the shadow minister. I thought his weakest argument was in relation to the issue of retention leases. As he would be well aware, once you have your exploration lease&mdash;once you find something that may not be viable at that time and take out a retention lease because you think that some time down the track that resource you have found will be viable&mdash;that precludes anybody else from looking in that particular lease area. The strongest argument for a charge lies in a retention lease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that the shadow minister made was that the charge was not valid because the more people looking, the cheaper the charge. I would have thought that was exactly the opposite in reality. Have a look at, say, the classic example in a free enterprise society of the model T Ford: the more that were made, the cheaper they got. There is an infrastructure cost of $20 million for a seismic vessel to operate&mdash;so the more people that take up leases, the cheaper the charge. I think that is a benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a charge. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) made a point about the wool market, and I totally agree with him on that. I think he made a very sensible analogy, but it is not relevant here because what you are paying for here is not one person getting a lot of leases and paying $100,000, nor is it one person getting one lease and paying $100,000&mdash;everybody pays the same fee. I thank the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne) for his contribution, and I will add no further to the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Given that the green paper says on page 52 that we need 4.75 per cent growth in each year between now and the end of the decade to get an unemployment rate of five per cent, and given that your own forecasts for the next several years predict growth of 4.5, 4.25, four and four per cent, does this not say that even by your own optimistic growth forecasts you will go nowhere near creating two million jobs, nowhere near achieving a five per cent unemployment rate, by the end of the decade?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="674" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The objective of a five per cent unemployment rate by the end of the century is certainly a worthy one and one which the government will strive to obtain. As has been made clear already, what exact numbers one needs to get to that level will depend on various factors which are outside the government's control, for instance things like the increase in the participation rate, a factor which is determined by the behaviour of individuals, by their indicating their desire to get into the work force in an increasing way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the social revolutions of our time is the increase in the participation rate, particularly by married women. That process can be expected to go on. In addition to that, there can be other inducements for people to move into the work force, particularly if real wages are increasing. So how fast the participation rate will increase is something which we will have to see over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can make assessments about what is a low level and a high level and a reasonable set of assumptions about what that might be. I think we would probably need something in the order of 170,000 jobs a year just to keep unemployment where it is. So that means we have to create considerable amounts of employment each year&mdash;over 170,000&mdash;to start knocking back unemployment levels. That is a basic fact of economic life which we have to address. In the last 12 months, we were very successful in doing that with 230,000 jobs and, consequently, a reduction in the unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the 1980s, we were very successful in increasing employment by over three per cent per annum. In fact, it increased by some 26 per cent in the period from 1983 to 1990 and gave us 1.7 million jobs in that seven-year period. The Leader of the Opposition is saying that that sort of thing cannot be done again. That is just being utterly pessimistic about the future&mdash;a sort of no hope proposition. He thinks there is no point in our trying to set an objective of five per cent unemployment, because it is unobtainable. It is obtainable, but obviously it requires a lot of things to go right for us. In particular it means that we have to have a high, sustained economic and employment growth for the rest of the decade, as we had through the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that our fundamentals are much better now, inflation rates are lower, interest rates are lower, profit share is high, productivity is higher, wages are being set on a productivity determined basis, international competitiveness is much better, all of these factors provide a much sounder basis for growth than we had in the 1980s. So there is no reason to be pessimistic about our prospects for getting that kind of growth again and getting unemployment down to around the five per cent level by the end of the century.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. In light of the intense public interest in the budget forecast of an increase in business investment of 14.5 per cent, can the Treasurer provide the House with information which would assist in understanding the robustness of the forecast? Further, can the minister advise the House of the business community's reaction to the budget and the prospects for investment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the wake of the budget forecast, there has been some focus on the 14 1/2 per cent growth in business investment. That compares with an expected one per cent growth in 1993-94. The comparison is leading people to say, `This is a very sharp turnaround and, therefore, a bit unbelievable.' Let me just take the House back through history as to what happened in the 1980s. Over the 1980s, we had business investment at a peak growth rate of 17 per cent in one year. It bottomed at a negative growth rate of almost 13 per cent. So it is obviously a very volatile economic factor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979-80 business investment fell by three per cent. In the next year, it rose by 17 per cent. So we had a dramatic turnaround. In 1982-83 and 1983-84, business investment fell but bounced back by 14.9 per cent in 1984-85. In the last few years, we have seen investment fall by 25 per cent with the onset of the recession in 1991-92. It grew at around one per cent last year, and in the current year&mdash;1993-94&mdash;a bounce back in the order of 14 per cent would not be out of line with the kind of movement that we have seen in previous economic periods. So this is not something that is out of the blue or unusual or something that has not happened before. It is very much on a par with the kinds of bounce backs that we have seen from business investment after slack periods in our recent economic history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, other forecasters are saying that that is a reasonable estimate. BT Australia's forecast for investment growth is 15.6 per cent. The National Australia Bank says 15 per cent and CS First Boston says 14 per cent. So these are private sector forecasters saying that they expect business investment to pick up strongly in the forthcoming year. There are very good reasons for that to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good reasons are these: we have seen corporate profitability improve quite considerably in recent times. The corporate profit share is now 17.7 per cent of GDP, which is the highest profit share since September 1985. We have low inflation and low inflation expectations, so inflation is likely to remain low. The balance sheet restructuring period for businesses seems to be over. Our competitiveness internationally has increased by 20 per cent over the last two  years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have growth in domestic demand, with little growth in the capital stock in recent years, which is leading to a rapid return to more normal levels of capital utilisation. Clearly, in the central business district property area, there is an overhang which is rather larger than that for plant and equipment. That will take a bit longer to turn around. In plant and equipment we are seeing capacity utilisation increase very rapidly. We have high business confidence, which is obviously important for investment. The surveys on that show that business confidence now is at its highest level for five years and that in the manufacturing industry it is the highest for 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also there are very substantial tax inducements to investment. Some people have been saying that the government should have done more in this budget to give industry an incentive to invest. Look at what has happened in recent times. In the One Nation package there were accelerated depreciation, the development allowance, the 150 per cent write-off for research and development, the general investment allowance and the cut in the corporate tax rate from 39 to 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a $3 billion list of incentives to businesses to invest. Clearly there is a very substantial tax incentive to do so, especially given the fact that the investment allowance requires those who would seek to take some benefit from it to have their investment in place by the end of the year 1994-95. In other words, if they want to utilise that extra 10 per cent write-off, they have to get their investments up by the end of 1994-95. That is a powerful inducement to investment in the forthcoming financial year. For all of those reasons, I believe that the 14 1/2 per cent forecast is well based. Clearly, it is an estimate and it is not absolutely written in concrete, but it is a sound estimate, in my view, and one which accords with historical precedents. There are a lot of good, very sound reasons as to why that forecast should come through.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is again directed to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to an assurance that he gave this House on 10 May 1993 that the government did not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation. I also refer the Treasurer to the fact that according to the budget papers tax as a share of GDP has increased from 21.9 in 1993-94 to 22.5 in 1994-95 to 23 per cent in 1995-96. Will the Treasurer confirm that he has broken yet another promise to the Australian people?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="675" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no broken promise and there are no tax increases in this budget, much to the chagrin of the opposition, whose whole preparation for this budget was on the basis that it was going to be a tax and spend budget. In fact, last night, following a budget with no tax increases, the shadow treasurer said to the nation that this was a tax and spend budget. What a ludicrous statement&mdash;there are no tax increases but this is a tax and spend budget! You just could not change your rhetoric in time to fit in with the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition should know something about the cyclical movement in the taxation share of GDP. He knows&mdash;he should know, anyway, unless he has forgotten all his economics&mdash;that, as the economic cycle picks up and employment picks up and there is an increase in real incomes, we see tax becoming a slightly higher share of GDP. There is nothing wrong with that. People are not paying higher tax rates. It simply means that with a more buoyant economy we see that there is more tax revenue, particularly through employment. That gives us some pick-up in the tax proportion of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing unusual about it; it happens in every economic cycle. It is not surprising that our figures show that. It is a product of the strength of the recovery, not a product of this budget imposing a great burden of taxation on the Australian people. You know that to be a fact. Mr Speaker, it is a nonsense proposition. The fact is that tax, as a proportion of GDP, will remain well below the level of the 1980s and there will be no increase in the overall burden of taxation compared with what it was at that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of criticism that the government's deficit reduction program as outlined in the budget papers does not go far enough and that it is largely achieved through asset sales? How does the government's program compare with those of other countries and to what extent is it actually dependent on the proceeds of asset sales?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="676" SPEAKER="Beazley The Hon K.C." NAMEID="PE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SWAN" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has not only confirmed its commitment to the deficit reduction target, it has also exceeded it. The deficit in 1994-95 will be $11.7 billion, or 2.5 per cent of GDP. That is down from $13.6 billion, or 3.2 per cent, last year. It will fall to only 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, and 0.4 per cent in 1997-98.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been achieved while accommodating something like $3 billion worth of decreases in business taxes over the last couple of economic statements and a white paper at its maximum point of some $1.9 billion. It gives us, nevertheless, one of the tightest fiscal policies in the OECD. When our deficit will be less than one per cent, the US will be at 2.3; Canada, three; France, 2.5; and the United Kingdom, about two. Australia has one of the lowest ratios of government outlays to GDP in the OECD. Commonwealth outlays in 1994-95 will be reduced from 26.6 per cent of GDP to 26.2 per cent. This compares with 28.8 per cent when we came into office in 1982-83. If we were still spending at the rate of the previous coalition government, outlays would be some 2.6 per cent of GDP higher, or about $12 billion higher this year than they are in fact going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some comments about the use of asset sales to reduce the budget deficit. Government outlays as a proportion of GDP would have been reduced even without the income from asset sales. Overall outlays will fall from 26.6 per cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 24.9 per cent in 1996-97. Excluding asset sales, government outlays would still fall to 25.1 per cent of GDP. The asset sales program commenced in 1987-88 and proceeds have averaged less than one per cent of outlays over that period. In 1997-98, there will be virtually no impact from asset sales. Outlays will still fall further then to only 24.2 per cent of GDP, and the deficit to 0.4 per cent of GDP. If there were no asset sales in that year, outlays would still be at 24.2 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, quite clearly, the deficit reduction target of the government is both on track and not dependent upon asset sales for its success. If we actually took anything from the opposition on this point, we would basically operate on this basis: unless our budget was in balance, we would have no asset sales. That is basically the proposition opposition members put forward: unless our budget was in balance, we would have no asset sales. Their argument is that it is illegitimate in the period in which we are incurring some level of debt to actually count asset sales against it. That is effectively the logic of the proposition the opposition has put forward. If that were the case, there would have been absolutely no asset sales under the previous Liberal government, because it only once managed to get itself into balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the asset sales program is related to a whole series of other policy considerations that have nothing to do with the issue of budget deficit. It has everything to do with increasing the competitiveness and the efficiency of the particular assets concerned, and it has everything to do with exiting the government's standing in the market when there is no need for it to be there any longer because the time of a natural monopoly may have passed or whatever. Asset sales, whilst essential for a variety of policy reasons, are not essential for achieving the government's task of a continual reduction in the size of outlays as a percentage of our gross domestic product.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the period leading up to the recession, we had budget surpluses that turned around with the recession, and properly so. Those deficits protected us from having a severe slump. We went into recession, but not too deeply&mdash;nowhere near as deeply as we would have had we not had the deficit increases that we had and the turnaround in the budget balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That has some impact on public debt. It has been said that that therefore creates a problem for Australia. Certainly it increases the public debt interest, but it is also relevant to get these things in perspective. The fact is that we have a gross debt for 1994 that is, on Treasury estimates, 29 per cent of GDP. That compares to the average for OECD countries of 68 1/2 per cent. So no other country in the OECD list for which figures are available has a lower gross public debt as a proportion of GDP than Australia.

With low inflation, we do not get much in the way of fiscal drag at all. So I am not sure where the $4 billion to $6 billion figure comes from. There will be some fiscal drag with low inflation, but it will be an awful lot less than that which occurred under the coalition government with its high rates of inflation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question. The basic thrust of the government's reform of social security income support payments for the unemployed is to try to achieve a situation where people on unemployment payments, whether they are single, part of a couple, whether or not they have children, invariably benefit by raising their work effort&mdash;whether the opportunity is to take up further part-time work or to take up a full-time job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that, the government is bringing in the parenting allowance of up to $133 a week. That allowance will have the effect of overcoming an existing impediment to couples with children taking up work where they are both unemployed and the offer emerges of a low paid full-time job. Under existing arrangements, quite often such a family can actually be worse off as a consequence of one member of the family taking up a low paid full-time job with the other member of the couple staying home to care for the children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is a major reform which overcomes that poverty trap and also makes more real the existence of a choice for low income families as to whether both want to take up full-time work or whether they prefer a situation where one is engaged in full-time parenting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I talked about these new measures on Monday in answer to a question about this matter. But in response the honourable member for Bennelong that day put out a press release referring to income splitting. I was contrasting the effect of our changes with income splitting. In his press release he said, `The new parenting allowance delivers substantially the same benefit to low income single-income families as would income splitting.' This statement is outrageously untrue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take a specific example, a single-income family on not much above the lowest full-time award wage, say $300 a week. Under income splitting this family would lose $3.75 a week. That family under our provisions will receive over $84 per week in parenting allowance, which is $57 a week more than the with child dependent spouse rebate; in other words, $60 more than the honourable member for Bennelong would give them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have tried to do with this change to the income support system is eliminate poverty traps and make sure, as I said at the outset, that families in those circumstances&mdash;a couple with dependent children, and one of the parents is offered a full-time job prospect&mdash;are better off by taking up that work. The parenting allowance is the key instrument by which we achieve that objective. Not only would the coalition not do that if it adopted the honourable member for Bennelong's income splitting proposal; it would actually make that poverty trap worse. Whichever way we look at it, this is an outrageously inequitable proposition. It really exemplifies the lack of concern the opposition has for equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other propositions rattling around in the opposition in relation to this area. One of them has been put forward by Senator Minchin. He says that we should combine all family payments, all child-care rebates, into one big lump and then divide it up and pay it to all families with children on a per child basis. What would that do to the low income family I talked about which got $300 a week, which had two children under 13 and which was living in private rental accommodation? Under our proposal that family would get $207 per week in family payments, rent assistance and parenting allowance. The Minchin proposal&mdash;which the honourable member for Bennelong commented on in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> article on 28 March and said was a reasonable option that should be considered&mdash;would involve a cut to that family of over $120 a week. Contrary to what the honourable member for Bennelong had to say, there is a vast difference between our proposals and their proposals both in terms of equity and in terms of work force incentives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The budget that was brought down last night by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) is a tax and spend budget. There are no ifs and buts about it: it is a tax and spend budget. This budget tells you one thing about the Labor Party in government: the government is pocketing the benefits of the recovery. Most Australians get nothing except a higher tax bill. They get no tax relief. They pay higher petrol taxes, they face longer hospital queues, they pay higher tobacco taxes; but they get nothing at all out of this budget. Just about every figure in this budget is rubbery, except for the tax increases. They are law, l-a-w, implemented in legislation that was passed at the end of last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a budget which is absolutely full of forecasts which the Treasurer himself is not happy to stand by. At the Press Club today he was asked a question about his forecast for jobs growth. He was asked whether by the year 2000 unemployment would be reduced to five per cent and two million jobs would be created. This is the boast that ministers and members of the Labor Party are going around making but that the Treasurer, confronted with the press gallery, was not prepared to make. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it's difficult to be adamant that one is going to achieve forecasts like five per cent by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is not prepared to endorse the forecast that unemployment will fall to five per cent by the year 2000. That figure is just a political mirage designed once more to deceive the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just have a look at the assertion that this budget is a tax and spend budget. That the Labor Party government throws money at any problem in society is well known to all Australians. Nobody would be surprised to hear that the budget is replete with administrative waste and that there is extravagance in terms of the increase in administrative costs of running the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that 1994-95 will be the year of the tax collector and the year when taxes right across the board increase&mdash;and increase very substantially. Let us look at some of the taxes that will increase during this coming year. First of all, let us look at the indirect taxes. The Treasurer said in his speech last night, and tried to imply to Australians generally, that there would be no increases in this coming year. I have noticed him and his colleagues trying to pound that message out across the radio and television waves so Australians will believe that this is a sort of no tax budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are Australians going to be hit with during the next financial year? First of all, on 1 August motorists will be hit with a 1c a litre increase in tax on unleaded fuel and a 2c a litre increase in tax on leaded fuel. In total, as a result of the legislation that the Labor Party&mdash;with the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;passed late last year, this coming financial year the government will get $1.3 billion worth of extra revenue out of Australians just in terms of fuel excise. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at tobacco excise. From 1 August 1994 Australians will be paying five per cent more excise on their tobacco. From 1 February 1995 they will be paying another five per cent excise on their tobacco. On 1 July the sales tax on wine is going up to 24 per cent from 22 per cent. Let us take sales taxes generally. At the end of the financial year, when Australians have finally got through all of the increases in other indirect taxes, on 1 July 1995 they will be hit with another one per cent increase in sales tax on everything from toothpaste to washing powder to household goods and confectionary. So, just on the indirect tax side, using the budget figures written into the budget as part of the budget, during the next financial year the government will hit Australians with additional indirect taxes of between $2 billion and $3 billion. And that is just indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians running businesses who are already struggling with the burden of the fringe benefits tax, which is another kind of payroll tax, should sit down and look at these budget papers and at what is said in this budget. According to Labor Party rhetoric, this is supposed to be a budget in which there are no tax increases. Australians running businesses will find that in this budget there will be a 130 per cent increase in the tax takes this man over here gets from the fringe benefits tax. How is that going to encourage businesses to employ and grow and compete when we have the Labor Party, in government, increasing fringe benefits taxes by 130 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the government has this claim that each year for the next four years it is going to collect something like $300 million from so-called compliance by getting the Australian tax office to tighten up its measures. Remember the Australian tax office, which the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used to boast had solved all of our tax problems? The Prime Minister went to elections claiming there were no tax rorts left in Australia. Apparently that is not true. Apparently over the next four years there is $1.2 billion that can be taken out of the community as a result of increased compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As somebody said to me the other day, small businesses particularly will find tax collectors pouring through their doors, going through their books, adding to their administrative costs, adding to the time they have to spend in administration, and dotting every i and crossing every t in tax in order for the Labor Party to suck more tax out of the Australian community. Finally, let us look at income tax. The government says that income tax is not going up. Over the next year, income tax receipts will increase by a massive 8.1 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lilley says `good'. That is a very Labor thing to say. That is what the Labor Party would always say: `Good. Let's hit people with more tax. Let's tax them more.' Of course, as I pointed out, this budget does tax them more. Over the next four years the government has between $4 billion and $6 million being sucked out of the Australian community in the form of bracket creep. In question time we pointed out how all that contrasts with the glib promises made by the Prime Minister&mdash;and, I am sorry to say, also by a man who people used to think was so honest and reasonable, the Treasurer himself&mdash;at the time of the last election and beyond. We will not forget the Prime Minister's interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> on 4 March 1992, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we will return to taxpayers the impact of inflation, even low inflation on the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>This was all about tax cuts which were in law&mdash;l-a-w, law&mdash;but the bulk of those tax cuts, five-eighths of them, were put off until 1998 in the last budget. In this budget, if we look at the forward estimates, they are not even there. They have completely disappeared into thin air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer comes to the dispatch box and says, `Maybe these tax cuts will occur some time in the future.' Anything can happen in the future. The earth might collide with the sun one day in the future. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said, England might even beat Australia at the Ashes some time in the future&mdash;although I find that very hard to believe. But the fact is that these tax cuts are dead and buried. They have been buried very solidly six feet under&mdash;or two metres under&mdash;in this year's budget. They are completely gone. I thought it was ironic that on the exact day of the budget a year ago, on 10 May 1993, I asked the now Treasurer whether he could confirm that the government would not increase tax as a proportion of GDP. In his answer, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has made it clear in statements in the past by the Treasurer&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of course, that was Mr Dawkins&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that in relation to taxation it does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on and on in that vein, yet the reality is that the government is proposing very substantial increases in the burden of taxation. In financial year 1993-94, tax will be 21.9 per cent of GDP; next year, 22.5 per cent; the year after, 23 per cent; and the year after that, 23.1 per cent. It does not matter how you try to contort and distort the figures; you were happy to make the promise a year ago, Treasurer&mdash;the Prime Minister, of course, will make a promise about anything to get a vote, but you have not had that reputation over the years&mdash;that there would not be an increase in the burden of tax. Now you have the gall to stand up and say that an increase in taxation as a proportion of GDP is not apparently an increase in the burden of tax. Of course it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, this year in real terms tax will increase by 7.4 per cent. That is a bigger increase in one year in the tax burden in this country than has occurred in any of the previous 10 years. So this year's budget is the biggest taxing budget for a decade. The government is trying to get people to believe that there are no tax increases in this budget. I say to Australians that they should read the budget, particularly the chapter on revenue in budget paper No. 1, and they will find page after page of tax increases right throughout it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of the budget which the government is trying to justify is the fact that according to its own figures it will run a deficit of $11.7 billion. That is a massive budget deficit. It is the third biggest budget deficit that we have ever had in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia&mdash;at a time when the economy is growing at four per cent and the Treasurer is claiming it is going to grow by 4 1/2 per cent next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple question is this: what sort of responsible economic manager would pump prime an economy which is already growing at between four and 4 1/2 per cent? But here we have a Labor government pump priming, pump priming, pump priming. Why? Because it is good macro-economic management? No, because it does not have the courage and it does not even have the sense to make sure it gets its own budgetary position under some degree of control. The government did better last time. Coming out of the last recession, at this same point, the budget deficit was, as a proportion of GDP, around a third the size of what it is this time around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price the government pays for running these big budget deficits is that, in the end, interest rates will be higher than would have been the case had the government taken a more responsible approach to fiscal policy. When the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been asked in the last 12 to 18 hours whether they would guarantee there will be no increases in interest rates over the next twelve months, neither of them has given that guarantee. Of course they will not. Because the Treasurer, his department and the Reserve Bank of Australia know that interest rates will increase during the next 12 months, and they will increase quite markedly. The Treasurer does not want to tell Australians that at the moment, just as he does not want to tell Australians that this budget is the biggest taxing budget in a decade. He does not want to tell people that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everybody knows, the Treasurer's deficit figures are achieved by using asset sales&mdash;$2.4 billion worth of asset sales in this year. The government just squanders the money. It is all gone. It does not invest it in reducing government debt to get a recurrent benefit. It just spends it all in one year. It is like selling the family home, spending all of the money on an overseas trip or whatever it might be and ending up with nothing at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, when it comes to Labor budgets, we have heard it all before. We heard Treasurer Keating say in the 1990 budget speech that we had entered an age of budget surpluses. In the same budget speech, he said, `The adjustment will occur without the misery of high unemployment and a savage recession.' This is precisely what we got. This time, it is the same old political glittering rhetoric&mdash;everything is going to be perfect, there is nothing wrong, we are in some new golden era of eternal high growth and eternal low inflation. The fact is that we have heard it before and we know what the government is up to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In other words, if we were today to run the same tax revenue regime as the honourable member for Bennelong ran in 1992-83 in his last budget, then we would be raising another $11 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet opposition members have the hide to stand here and say that this is a government which is absolutely ripping it off the Australian people with great swingeing tax increases when we are raising $11 billion a year less in tax than they raised in their last year in office. What incredible hide. What amazing gall for them to take this approach. What a pathetic response. What an absolutely bereft response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, the opposition has nothing of substance to say about this budget. It is purely trying to beat up on the tax issue, trying to point to some increases in taxes which are largely coming from the fact that we have recovery, and trying to create some sort of scare campaign about swingeing tax levels being imposed on people when the people of Australia are living in the lowest taxed country in the western world. That is the reality for Australian people to realise, and they know that in this budget there were no tax increases at all. So, really, this whole gambit of the opposition is a last pathetic throw. It knows that in this budget it is cornered; there is nowhere to go because this government has got the economy back onto a substantial growth path and with an economy which is dramatically improved in its fundamentals from what it used to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opposition members do not want to talk about anything of that because that is too difficult. They know there is nothing they can really criticise us on there, particularly when Australia is growing much faster than any other western industrial country. The rest of the industrial world grew by one per cent in 1993. What did we grow by? Four per cent. That is four per cent against one per cent, but opposition members do not want to talk about any of that because it is just too terrible even to contemplate talking about comparisons of growth rates. They cannot attack us on that. They want to beat up some issue on taxation. It really is the most pathetic attempt. </PARA>

That would mean getting rid of the sorts of things the Asians do not have, such as social benefits for people who are disabled, unemployed, retired, sick and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the position opposition members are painting themselves into. We look forward with great interest to seeing the further development of this because, as they spell this out, I am sure the Australian people will be exceedingly interested to see the detail and certainly to see how it squares up with the statements that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) is making about how the opposition is so concerned about social injustice and the need to be concerned about the disadvantaged. We look forward to all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should really be discussed today is not this beat-up issue of taxation in which the opposition has not one skerrick of credibility but, rather, what is happening to the Australian economy in this budget, why this country is in such good shape in terms of its fundamentals and why this country is performing so well economically. That is what I am sure the people of Australia are interested to hear about. They know that we have this much higher growth rate than the rest of the industrial world and that there is every reason to expect that growth rate to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians can take great comfort from the fact that we have developed an economy which is much more efficient, competitive, dynamic and export orientated than the economy we inherited from the opposition, which gave us an economic structure which would take this country absolutely nowhere into the future. That economy has been transformed and we are now looking at an economy which is infinitely more capable of producing economic prosperity for the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A look at the budget shows that prosperity is beginning to come through. It can be seen in terms of the three per cent growth in employment. We have already had three per cent growth over the last 12 months, and we expect to have three per cent growth in 1994-95. That will give us in the order of 240,000 additional jobs. That is coming not from the Working Nation statement but from economic growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation statement is not about creating new jobs. There will be an incidental element of that&mdash;some addition&mdash;but it is not the basic rationale for it. The basic rationale for it is to make sure that the long-term unemployed and new entrants to the work force have a much better chance of getting the jobs that come on stream than they would otherwise have if no such assistance were forthcoming, as is encompassed in the Working Nation statement. That is the reality. So economic growth is producing jobs and prosperity in terms of increased real incomes. Real wages, real household disposable income and the profitability of companies are increasing. People can see that prosperity being spread across primary income receivers throughout the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not everyone is sharing equally in that. Those who are dependent upon commodities have to live with very low commodity prices. They will not share in that prosperity as much as others at this time, but hopefully commodity prices will continue to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wanted to ensure that in this budget steps were taken to address the circumstances of the socially disadvantaged, particularly those who were nominated in the budget such as the mentally handicapped, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and homeless people&mdash;we are looking after the long-term unemployed through the Working Nation statement&mdash;so that we did look after the disadvantaged and made sure that the prosperity which the nation is now experiencing is spread across the rest of the community and we do not leave behind large segments of it. That is what this budget is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This budget does not impose swingeing taxes on people but brings about economic prosperity with the lowest tax regime in the Western world. It does it in a way which is producing great benefits for the Australian people. The comforting thing about it is that it is not boom and bust, as the opposition would have us believe, but something which is clearly and soundly based. It is based on fundamentals which are dramatically different from the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have two per cent inflation. At the beginning of the 1980s when the opposition was still in office, inflation was over 10 per cent. Through the 1980s, it averaged eight per cent. It gradually tracked down. Even though we had a boom at the end of the 1980s, it still remained at about the six per cent mark. But now it is down to two per cent. It clearly gives us a competitive edge. Our competitiveness has been improving because of low inflation, productivity improvement and falling real unit labour costs. Because we have been able to produce efficiently and bring unit labour costs down, we are able to be more competitive against the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means that we are able to get growth in exports. We are seeing tremendous growth in exports. Since the mid-1980s, manufactured exports have been growing at the rate of 13 per cent in volume, not just value. Last year, they grew by 15 per cent. These are extraordinarily high rates of growth. It is true that they are coming off a small base, but it is rapidly becoming a much bigger base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export of services grew by nine per cent per annum over that period, and it rose 11 per cent last year. That is not happening by accident; it is happening because the fundamentals of the economy are just so much better and because we have been able to get into the minds of our entrepreneurs that the rest of the world is not a threat. We do not need to hide behind great tariff barriers as though we are scared of ever having to deal with the rest of the world. It is a challenge and a great opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As tariff barriers have come down, the whole mentality of Australian producers has changed. They are seeing opportunities and making great use of them, as the figures for manufactured and service exports show. That is enormously beneficial for us, because at the moment we are living with extraordinarily awful commodity prices. Those commodity prices are totally beyond the capacity of the government to control. They are determined by world demand and supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had we not had this diversification of exports, we would certainly be facing a very bad balance of payments situation. That would be an enormous constraint on growth. But, because we have been able to have that diversification of exports, we are able to go on with the growth and contain the current account deficit to a level which we can live with. That demonstrates the enormous benefit to this nation of the fundamental changes which are taking place. We have every confidence that that will continue. It will continue because of those fundamental improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budgetary policy is playing its part in all of that. As we went into recession, we deliberately allowed the automatic stabilisers to turn the budget outcome around to limit the impact on the economy so that tax revenue fell and expenditure on unemployment benefits went up. We added to that some other measures to boost the economy. As the economy now comes back into strong growth, it is appropriate and proper that we withdraw that fiscal stimulus. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I woke up this morning and picked up the national newspapers, it seemed to me that just about every newspaper in the country had the word `gamble' on it. This government is gambling on a run of growth figures and on an investment figure, and it is hoping that business will do for it what it should have been able to do for itself. It could have done much better, but it failed. The tragedy for Australia is this: the government could have done better but it failed. As a result, it is gambling with the near and mid-term future of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the editorials of Australia's newspapers today spoke about a complacent budget of missed chances, pulling on the wrong levers or a high risk budget. They know that the fundamental underlying assumptions, forecasts and outcomes in relation to this budget could have been much better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has comprehensively gone through the revenue figures. He has shown that it does not matter whether one looks at company taxes, income taxes, sales taxes or fringe benefits taxes; the government is taking more as a result of this budget. It is taking more not only because it is growing but also because it is increasing rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just one fact alone proves that point conclusively. Tax as a share of GDP was 21.9 per cent in 1993-94, 22.5 per cent in 1994-95 and 23 per cent in 1995-96. That tells us that even though GDP is growing, revenues and taxes are growing at such a rate that they will be a larger proportion this year than they were last year, and they will be a larger proportion next year than they will be this year. That figure shows conclusively that this government is taking more. It is unbelievable that even though it is taking more, it is owing more at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming out of the 1982-83 recession, we were producing real surpluses by 1987-88&mdash;within five years. They were not surpluses that were being padded out by notional asset sales. Coming out of the 1991 recession, we are still running a net financing requirement of $20 billion&mdash;four years after the event&mdash;on a deficit of $11.7 billion which is padded with asset sales. The effect of that is the government is ratcheting up Commonwealth-owned debt to new plateaus so that by the time the next economic downturn comes, it will come on a higher plateau, when the government is more exposed, when the government is more at risk. It is gambling on increasing its debt to new plateaus which will leave it in a worse position in the next economic downturn. Despite the growth, despite the fact that the government would have us believe that we are entering a golden age, it is ratcheting up debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget papers presented by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) talk about a figure of $95 billion by the end of June 1995&mdash;about triple what it was at the end of 1991. When the minister was faced with that fact today, he gave us all the bluster; we got the whole Thomas the Tank Engine operation from him, but we did not have a fact&mdash;not one fact. There was lots of chuffing and chugging, there were wheels turning and there was toot-tooting, but there were no facts. There was no answer. It is obviously a matter of great embarrassment to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> explains the minister's problem: in Freudian terms he is an oral expressive and he is running a department that is anally retentive. In other words, things are going in but nothing is coming out. It is a basic problem for the Minister for Finance. We have only to look at the charts in the budget papers to see that the problem is that Commonwealth own purpose outlays are still increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is going on with all this talk about how Commonwealth expenditure and the fiscal stimulus have been withdrawn, but we have only to turn to chart 13 on page 6.24 of Budget Paper No. 1 to we see a line for Commonwealth own purpose outlays. Commonwealth own purpose outlays are increasing&mdash;and will increase again&mdash;and will hit nearly 20 per cent of GDP by 1993-94, which is about three percentage points of GDP higher than they were in 1982-83. This is at a time when the fiscal stimulus is supposedly being withdrawn and at a time when we have golden rates of economic growth&mdash;when we are still growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all fairness, the government has been cutting the states in relation to outlays&mdash;it has been giving them the kind of medicine that it will not take itself&mdash;but Commonwealth own purpose outlays are growing. We can see it in relation to the budget aggregate outcomes&mdash;about 2.9 per cent in real terms in the following year. There is no talk here of the government actually applying to itself the kind of stringency that it asks of the states, or the kind of stringency that it has imposed on small business as a result of its high interest rate policy and the economic recession that we had to have under the prime ministership of Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a lazy, complacent government when it comes to outlays, even to the extent where the great boasts in this budget in relation to spending were measures that we know were rejected by the government's own ERC. The papers were full of how the government's own ERC had rejected some of the proposals that were trumpeted as great breakthroughs in the budget speech the Treasurer (Mr Willis) delivered yesterday. It is clear that this government is raising revenue and is mortgaging future budgets because it cannot deal with its own problem. It cannot deal with its own purpose outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We notice in this budget that there is a $2 billion increase in public debt interest. The Commonwealth has to spend about $2 billion extra of the hard-earned taxes of Australians just to service the public debt interest&mdash;it is about a 36 per cent increase in the 1994-95 year. That figure will go up again because it will add another net financing requirement of about $20 billion in the 1994-95 year. The more Commonwealth owned debt is sent up, the more the servicing cost grows. The more the servicing cost grows, the less choices you have in the future in relation to discretionary expenditure because you are paying for past mistakes. This government is locking itself into lesser choices, lesser possibilities, lesser flexibility, as a result of its financial ineptitude over the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Walsh would never have stood for this kind of performance. The one thing you could say about Walsh is that he really would have tried to make a difference, tried to do the job at both ends, and tried to make sure that the Commonwealth government got into a much better position during periods of growth. It is during periods of growth, if they are to be believed, that grain should be put into the storehouses, that we should lay it up for the lean years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This $11.7 billion deficit is again padded out with things like the sale of Qantas. The sale of Qantas gets into just about every budget to pad out the deficit. The sale has already failed twice, but it is in there again to pad out the deficit and to try to give a headline figure to the financial markets&mdash;which had already taken their positions before the budget came down because they knew the truth. The truth is that because this government cannot get its act together, interest rates will be higher than they need to be. That rise will affect business. It will ultimately affect the taxpayers of Australia, who are already paying more through the tax system and who will get an even more raw deal as a result of this government's laziness, its complacency and its financial ineptitude. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways the matter of public importance which we are debating here today is a compliment to the government. The opposition is conceding that we are reaping the benefits of growth. It is a commonsense observation to make that, if more people are in work and if business is making more profit, then revenue will increase, thanks very much. Those opposite have actually conceded the centrepiece of the budget strategy&mdash;that the government has balanced program for growth. We also know there is a need to give incentives to business so that we get business investment. </PARA>

We have managed to do all that in this budget whilst, at the same time, bringing the deficit down to $11.7 billion&mdash;lower than was forecast and lower than the $13.6 billion deficit last financial year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's matter of public importance concedes the success of the government in economic management; we will bring the deficit down to about 0.9 per cent of GDP in 1996-97. The opposition is conceding that the economy is going to grow, that there will be more jobs and that there will be healthier profits. That is happening under a Labor government, which is why the business community of this country has deserted the opposition on the question of this budget.

As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) said before in this House, if the revenues we have now had applied when the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was Treasurer, the opposition would be raising $11 billion more in taxation.

The honourable member for Mayo, with the support of the honourable member for Higgins, came into this House and said that we should have Asian levels of taxation. That would mean cuts to the revenue of this country of between $11 billion and $30 billion a year. That is the sort of alternative the opposition is putting forward&mdash;massive cuts in expenditure. The honourable member for Mayo is on the record as saying that.

<PARA>If the honourable member for Mayo wants to go down the road of east Asian tax levels, he should bear in mind that we will be explaining to the business community of Australia that there are no more tax incentives, and that we will be explaining what that means to social programs. For example, if we were to move to the tax level of Indonesia, we would be cutting revenue in this country by $12 billion. That is equivalent to cutting the complete assistance that this government gives to the aged. If cuts like that are not vicious enough, if we were to move to the revenue level of, say, Taiwan, we would be cutting expenditure in this country by $33 billion. That would mean cuts to veterans' affairs of $4 billion, cuts to assistance to families with children of $9 billion, cuts to assistance to the unemployed of $7 billion, and cuts to assistance to the aged of $12 billion.

<PARA>HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is the major training establishment for the Royal Australian Navy. It is located on Western Port Bay, Victoria, some 60 kilometres south-east of Melbourne. Existing facilities and services date back to the early 1920s. A number of facilities are more modern or have been upgraded. The transfer of technical training from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> necessitates the provision of additional facilities to enable effective training to continue.

<PARA>The Australian Federal Police training college&mdash;formerly Lawley House, a Commonwealth government hostel&mdash;was completed in 1946. Major extensions were added to the hostel in 1967. Apart from work in the west wing to convert it to use as a training college in 1978 for the Commonwealth Police, no major refurbishing work has taken place since the building was constructed. In its present state, the building no longer satisfies Commonwealth or contemporary AFP requirements for residential accommodation, office accommodation or occupational health and safety. The majority of services&mdash;such as wiring, plumbing and drainage&mdash;are part of the original 1940s installation and are now substandard and subject to extensive ongoing maintenance work. The building is not air-conditioned, and the kitchen does not meet health standards. </PARA>

The Commonwealth law enforcement review, which was considered by cabinet on 23 March 1994, contained recommendations which will involve an enhanced role for the AFP investigative training. The impacts associated with the review will not have a significant bearing on the scope of the refurbishment proposal, as the training strategy encompassed in the review is consistent with the objectives of the refurbishment proposal: that is, development of an effective and functional training facility to meet Commonwealth law enforcement needs.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental test facility, ETF, is an army unit that undertakes environmental testing of equipment and explosive ordnance to ascertain compliance with defence specifications. The existing facilities at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Salisbury are in close proximity to the civilian population and other defence units. This restricts the size and the nature of the testing programs undertaken. It is proposed that the explosive ordnance testing function of the ETF move to a recently acquired site adjacent to the existing proof and experimental establishment at Port Wakefield. The proposal will provide improved testing facilities and enhance safety measures associated with testing activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal, which was referred to the public works committee on 14 December 1993, is to construct 16 buildings, including test buildings, small explosive storage magazines and administrative facilities on a greenfield site. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has approved the use of army engineers as the primary construction agency for the project. It is anticipated that the construction will commence in June 1994 and be completed by December 1995. A commercial project manager will oversight the work, and local suppliers and tradesmen will have the opportunity to bid for work. The outturn cost for this proposal is $8 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report, the public works committee endorsed the need for environmental stress testing of explosive ordnance and noted that the effectiveness and efficiency of the ETF at Salisbury are limited by operating constraints and the age and nature of the existing facilities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) is unaware of the stress and the public resentment about the siting of the proof range at Port Wakefield. I notice that this new facility, worth $8 million, is to be built adjacent to the existing proof range. This, of course, adds to the problem of disturbance which will occur and damage which will be done and is already being done in that part of South Australia in close proximity to the capital city of Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the proof range is one of growth&mdash;an incremental growth in regard to the development of new munitions and new guns&mdash;in a place where the proof range in 1928, when it was established, was secure in the sense that it was distanced from the capital city of South Australia. But since then, as I have said, there has been a growth in technology in relation to armaments, and there has been an increasing demand for a further expansion of the proof range. This has brought the proof range into direct collision with those who use the gulf for a recreation area and those who live in the northern areas of the metropolitan district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a social and ecological assessment, an impact statement, of 1985 which was sponsored by the government, which at that time had put forward a proposal to acquire two settlements on the gulf to further extend the proof range south of Port Wakefield. This caused a great deal of disturbance, and so it ought to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time the impact statement assessed that approximately 5,000 people per annum make use of the approximately 140 holiday homes at those two settlements. Additionally, a recreation survey conducted for the purposes of the EIS indicated that approximately 32,000 to 40,000 persons could visit the areas of Parham, Webb Beach, Port Prime and Thompsons Beach in any particular year. Based on the survey data, it was also estimated that the total number of annual person-day visits is between 300,000 and 320,000 at all four beaches and between 220,000 and 240,000 at Parham and Webb Beach alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An immense protest movement evolved in the face of this demand by the army and the Department of Defence to acquire further territory on that gulf. I was working assiduously with and on behalf of that protest group and I am pleased to say that after a great deal of public discussion about and acrimony over this matter the then Minister for Defence, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), withdrew the demand for acquisition. Whilst he did not say it in plain English, one got the impression that the testing of the Howitzer 155 millimetre gun would not proceed at that site. We have found that in the last few months there has been a very intensive test of that gun, much to the dismay of fishermen and despite the fact that at that time the army said the tests could not proceed unless these two sites were acquired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I view the army's attitude and involvement in this with deep suspicion. I believe that it is extremely conservative in regard to what it wants and that it treats the public with great disregard. It says very little publicly of what it is about and what its future intentions may be. In relation to usage, we find that the general area and kilometres involved were also given in the statement. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If ranges of 40 km are obtained the OWR&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>overwater range&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">requirement would approach 30 km.</PARA>
<PARA>The guns have to be fired to at least 75 per cent of their maximum range to effectively test munitions. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents the limit of OWR which can be accommodated in water south of Port Wakefield for at any greater range the intertidal conditions are unsuitable.</PARA>
<PARA>In testing this gun the army has reached the usage limit of that range, yet we can expect the technology of munitions and artillery to further increase their range and to further increase the need for overwater recovery of test munitions. To invest another $8 million alongside a proof range which will become obsolete in the face of further technical requirements and which is unwanted by South Australian residents is very foolish. There is also the matter of waste when this or a future government has to shift this range. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of information in this statement which shows how polluted the beach is. I remind the House that this is a beach within a relatively few kilometres of the city of Adelaide and a very important recreational area. Proof facilities would simply not be tolerated in any other capital city of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of detail is given about malfunctioning explosives. The recent test has drawn attention to this because of one particular type of explosive. This type constitutes the majority of firings and there is estimated to be a 3.4 per cent failure in recovery. The statement which succeeds this one indicates that each unfound ordnance or munition would have to be marked by a buoy and people would be prohibited from proceeding within at least a hundred metres of that buoy. Local fishermen indicate that the high explosives create enormous disturbance of the seabed and, therefore, wherever these guns are used a continually increasing area of beach and sea cannot be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as this already heavily polluted beach south of the Port Wakefield range, which experts say will never be cleared and will not be safe for use by the public in the foreseeable future, we are faced with the expansion of the range and further significant pollution of sea and beach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the development of the impact statement, reference was made to options. I believe that in making this reference the defence department was extremely negligent in considering any suitable alternative that could be found for this range. It was said that ranges are used in other parts of the world in other forms, but the Port Wakefield range is supposedly one of the best in the world because of the sloping seabed and the retreat of the tide, which enables recovery of spent ammunition. What the defence department did not fully proceed to explain is why it is unable to create artificial water bodies which are sufficiently suitable for their purposes. It referred to pond use overseas and to the use of snow and other soft surfaces, but it has never said why it cannot create an artificial lake sufficiently large to receive shells used in target practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement is very delinquent indeed in examining an alternative arrangement. I do not believe the defence department or the army were serious at looking at alternatives. I do not believe they intended then, as they do not intend now, to take note of public opinion or of the opinion of the then state government of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is something of a ruse involved since the then minister announced in 1986 that the government would not proceed with the acquisition. It was thought then that another range would be found or developed for the purposes of testing the 155 millimetre Howitzer. That is not the case and South Australia has just experienced a very vigorous test in its gulf. Main roads were closed to enable the firing of the guns and fishermen were irate that they were prohibited from fishing in some of the best parts of the gulf for a month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual usage and the irritation of the moment is not the point. The point is that the development of a recreational area in the long-term future is being denied South Australians by the close proximity to the capital city of a very large testing range. It is simply unfair that the rest of Australia should impose this on my state, on the coast in this close-in area. Whilst it may be a separate test area in relation to the proof range, it is adjacent. To add to the general value of and investment in an area which is obsolete in terms of development is essentially a waste of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I warn the minister that public opinion will not allow this facility to remain in the long term. It is simply untenable, as we look forward to planning for the next 10, 20 or 30 years, to say, `Yes, we can go on polluting for all time a recreational beach for a million people.' It is nonsense and it is time the government of the day understood that. The government should have studied the problems that surrounded this impact statement and the proposals of 1985 and 1986. It should have gone to the Minister for Defence and asked him what his motives were and then retreated in the face of public opinion, as he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is indeed at fault in proceeding along these lines, in not acceding to public opinion. It will cost the Australian taxpayer just that much more when the facility being approved now is shifted within the next 10 or 20 years. There is not the slightest doubt that public opinion will prevail in relation to this area so close to the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action is all part of the trashing of the gulf. It is all part of denying development of a recreational area of a rather vast dimension in our city. What other city in Australia would allow this to happen? What new technology will be incrementally introduced into this area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister: is it a fact that ammunition from overseas is being tested at this facility? It is a very pertinent question. Is this Australian beach being polluted by ammunition tested for a foreign power? Is that the case or is it not? If the ammunition of a foreign power is being used to trash St Vincents Gulf, I warn the minister that he is in for some long-term trouble. I do not want a cover-up on this. I do not want anyone to tell me that it is classified as to whether some overseas ammunition is churning up the fishing areas and the recreational areas of my state. I want an answer from the minister and, if he does not know the answer, I ask him to find out. No classified information should be denied to the public of South Australia on the basis of some deal we have with a foreign power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal of information about the position of this facility is available. The minister is adding to it. He will waste $8 million in the longer term. New technology will put further pressure on this area, and the public resents this and will not accept it. I believe there are alternatives which could be developed. However, the army and the Defence Force, in their conservatism and their safe feeling that they can ignore the public, have refused to develop and examine these alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If just south of that area thousands of hectares of salt ponds can be created artificially of about the same depth that the proof range requires to test its ammunition in a private salt-producing commercial venture, will anyone believe the army that it cannot can do likewise somewhere else to test its ammunition? The fact that the army cannot find and construct another facility in a more isolated space is a farce. I warn the minister that what he is now doing is wrong. It will be proven wrong and it will cost the Australian community a great sum to finally remove these substantial facilities out of the way of metropolitan development. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be no extra explosives. The honourable member canvassed some issues about the Howitzer gun. The Howitzer gun was across the gulf. It was not from this range at all. The honourable member was being misleading in saying that it was from this range. I chaired the public works committee which dealt with this matter. Our inquiry was widely advertised. Everyone who appeared before the committee supported this project. The local council supported it; the local federal member supported it; everyone supported it. I have heard the complaints that have been made over the last month, but it is amazing that, even though this project was widely advertised, we did not have anyone appear before us who opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups have been complaining about what happened over there last month, but it was not from this range at all. They were testing from across the bay. Sure, it was a very loud explosive. This is a recreational area a few miles from Adelaide. I have been there and there are better beaches around Adelaide, believe you me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my speech last week&mdash;and this is mentioned in our report&mdash;no extra work will be carried out there. There is no great secret about foreign orders. The facility is there to test foreign ammunition, as it always has been. We are only continuing what we were doing. We are taking it from a suburb of Adelaide and, instead of trundling all this equipment through the suburbs of Adelaide, which I thought the honourable member would be concerned about, we are putting it out in a relatively remote area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The range has not expanded at all. The diameter of the range is exactly what it was before. The same amount of work will be carried out there. Only the ammunition will be stored out of suburban Adelaide. As I said, no-one came to us with these opposing views. It is not a recreational beach. The honourable member for Wakefield made all these points in his speech. That beach has been polluted for years and years. I am sure the army would invite the honourable member for Boothby out there and give him a demonstration of what it does, as it did for us. It shoots the shells out there and, as the honourable member knows, it recovers them in the low tide. All the shells that are being shot out there are recovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Boothby is right in saying that it is a polluted beach, but that pollution goes back to the period of the Second World War. The honourable member is correct in saying that that part of the gulf is trashed, but we did not trash it. The present facility did not trash it. It was trashed due to the tests that were carried out during the Second World War. That is the problem. The honourable member knows better than I that the beach is now closed. He was misleading when he said that it was a recreational area for one million people in Adelaide. Parham may be a recreational beach, but that area of the range, as the honourable member knows better than I do, is already closed and off-limits. It is off-limits because of the garbage that has been left there since the Second World War. </PARA>

During question time, the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) quite erroneously and, I think, maliciously chose to stand up in this place, when he did not have an answer to a question on government debt and expenditure, and claim that the coalition had attempted, by opposing the second reading of one of these bills, to stop government revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>

That simply was that, whilst we did not oppose the government's need for revenue in providing this service, and whilst we did not oppose the concept of user-pays, we thought the processes the government was using were, to use my words, silly in as much as it chose, for instance, to divide the number of submerged land leaseholders into a $10 million amount of money and therefore charge an equal sum&mdash;which I think is $100,000&mdash;to everybody. That was the thing to which the coalition was objecting to, and which the industry objects to also. We argued for a proper user-pays.

<PARA>The purpose of this bill is to make minor amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Maritime College Act 1978, and to repeal other acts relating to employment, education and training. The amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 provides minor adjustments to financial amounts. These adjustments flow from the transfer of responsibilities for funding the Institute of the Arts of the Australian National University from the ACT government to the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACT government receives special revenue assistance as part of general revenue payments from the Commonwealth. The level of special revenue assistance has in the past made allowance (as assessed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission) for the cost of funding the Institute of the Arts so as to maintain the same level of courses as existed at the time of self-government. In accordance with the Commonwealth Grants Commission's 1992 update of relativities, the Commonwealth will provide the funding directly to the Australian National University through the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 with a consequential reduction in special revenue assistance to the ACT government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additional funding adjustments are required as a result of Senate amendments to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 which removed the provisions for a double rate of the higher education contribution scheme, HECS, on undergraduate students undertaking a second degree at the same or lower level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the financial adjustments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 relating to the transfer of funding for the Institute of the Arts and the removal of double HECS, this bill will provide an additional $26.1 million in 1994, $31 million in 1995 and $30.2 million in 1996. The increase in outlays will be partly offset by a reduction in payments from the higher education contribution scheme trust account of $20.9 million in 1994, $20.5 million in 1995 and $18.9 million in 1996. In the longer term, Commonwealth outlays will increase by approximately $27 million each year due to the removal of the double HECS provisions. In addition, a reduction in general revenue payments to the ACT government of $3.3 million in 1995 and 1996 will be made to fully offset the payments for the Institute of the Arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is usually convenient to include all the amendments affecting payments under the Higher Education Funding Act in a  Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill implementing budget or additional estimates decisions about higher education funding. However, the current amendment affects amounts to be paid in calendar year 1994 and it is therefore desirable that the revised amounts be legislated as soon as practicable. This bill is the first available vehicle on the legislation program for this portfolio which can contain the amendment. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that there is no constitutional or other legal impediment to including the amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill's provisions also include amendments to the Maritime College Act 1978. These amendments include appointing the chairperson of the academic board as an ex officio member of the Australian Maritime College Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">5.28 p.m.)&mdash;The bill before the House, the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill, is largely straightforward and the coalition will not be opposing the amendments it makes to the acts in question. In particular, we support the amendment to the Maritime College Act. It should increase involvement by staff at the college and appears to be a sound approach to the college's management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant section of the bill is part 4, which increases the maximum level of recurrent grants for higher education institutions, a consequence of the government's being forced last year to abandon its plans to double higher education contribution scheme charges for students undertaking second undergraduate courses at the same or higher level. This was as a result of the coalition's objections to the government's proposal as punitive, unfair and disadvantaging many groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's decision followed a long period of consultation with and representations from many groups in the community. The feedback was that such legislation would have disadvantaged women who need to upgrade their training after an absence from the work force, usually for family reasons; the legislation would have disadvantaged the disabled, who frequently need to retrain in order to re-enter the work force; the legislation would have disadvantaged those who are required to complete an additional degree as a prerequisite for a prescribed course; the legislation would have disadvantaged migrants who had completed their initial degree overseas at no cost to Australian taxpayers&mdash;such degrees frequently not being recognised by Australian institutions&mdash;and who need to upgrade their training to gain better jobs and more productivity. Finally, it would have disadvantaged those who were, at the time, completing additional training who had not budgeted for the additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Many students in the above categories would have been forced to abandon their studies at a time when the community expects and demands higher levels of training. The government's intention in introducing a double HECS was to discourage some students from continuing their tertiary study. It was a bid to create more places for those studying for their first degree. However, a likely outcome would have been to force people out of the university system only to go onto the unemployment queue. At the time, the shadow minister for employment, education and training, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the legislation amounted to nothing more than sleight of hand to slug groups of students with a punitive charge by a Government intent on rationing higher education because of increased student demands.</PARA>
<PARA>The coalition's successful opposition to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 meant that the legislation failed to pass the Senate. As a result, those students who were either in the process of obtaining a second degree or considering the undertaking of a second degree will not be penalised, despite the government's plans for a double HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, five years after the introduction of the higher education contribution scheme, there are indications that the scheme needs to be examined in detail to identify exactly how much money is being collected, how much is really in arrears and to more effectively measure likely future debts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At time of the HECS introduction by the Hawke government in 1989, the assumption was that the federal government would recover most, if not all, the HECS debt. This assumption is steadily being disproved. Those concerned about the future of those undertaking tertiary education know that in the real world life does not always turn out as predicted. For example, the Australian economy's boom and bust cycles will mean that many of our future graduates' earning lives will be put on hold, with no lessening of their financial and personal commitments. Increasingly, the effort and sacrifices involved in their studies seem just a waste of time, with few job prospects at the end of the process. For many graduates, the achievement of a degree has turned into a hollow disappointment&mdash;a false promise of an assured future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year, a university of Canberra study suggested many graduates, especially women, would carry their HECS debt late into life. The government had calculated that these debts would be repaid nine to 11 years after they had been incurred. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Actuary has classified as doubtful $376.5 million of the $2,300 million HECS debt as at the last financial year. The fact is that 16.7 per cent of graduates are unlikely to ever earn enough to repay their HECS. The Actuary's report&mdash;prepared for the Department of Employment, Education and Training&mdash;found that of the $2,300 million in outstanding HECS, 9 1/2 per cent of the debt owed by male graduates and 19.4 per cent of the debt owed by female  graduates was unlikely to be repaid. In other words, a significant proportion of graduates will never earn enough money to pay back their HECS tuition fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that under Labor's HECS, full-time university students must pay $2,355 each year in tuition fees. Students can receive a 25 per cent discount by paying their fees up front, or they can repay the debt through the taxation system after they enter the work force. Graduates do not have to start repaying the HECS debt until they earn the average wage&mdash;$26,403 this year&mdash;when they must pay three per cent of their salary to DEET. The repayment rate rises to four per cent for graduates earning more than $30,000 and five per cent for those earning more than $42,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Actuary's report that I have referred to makes a number of assumptions. One is that male graduates earn a starting salary of $27,000 and female graduates $25,000 and that it will take them at least 10 years to repay their HECS debts. Secondly, it assumes that as graduates grow older and earn higher salaries they experience higher rates of unemployment. This is based on the official unemployment rates for February 1983 with `allowance made for some expected improvement in future years'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Actuary's report assumes an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent for 22-year-old male graduates whose earnings average $27,000 a year. For 35-year-old male graduates, average earnings are 50 per cent higher but their unemployment rate rises to 10 per cent. Twenty-two year-old female graduates' average earnings are $25,000 and they have an unemployment rate of 8.8 per cent&mdash;perversely, slightly higher than the  male rate despite their lower average earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government's assumptions with respect to graduates' abilities to repay HECS nine to 11 years after graduation obviously needs to be revised. Some graduates are taking a long time before being appointed to their first job, and not all graduates are proving to have the earning potential that was originally assumed. Many have needed to take a much lower salary in order to get into the work force. So we have a situation of the government's theory not working in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HECS is proving to be considerably less successful than was expected. What are the ramifications for tertiary education if a substantial minority of students&mdash;something of the order of 10 per cent to 20 per cent&mdash;are unlikely to earn enough to repay their HECS? Huge burdens have been placed on universities during the last decade, and these pressures show no signs of abating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A substantial shortfall in the HECS component must mean a comprehensive rethinking of future funding policies. It may be that doubtful debts on the scale of 16.7 per cent will be inevitable and that this figure reflects future normal levels of graduate remuneration and/or unemployment. Decisions will need to be made in order to determine whether the salary threshold should be lowered further and repayment rates increased, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following last night's budget speech, new university graduates will experience even more government pressure. From 1 January 1995, graduates will be forced to repay their HECS sooner and faster after entering the work force. In future,  HECS will be calculated on a pro rata basis so that employed graduates could be liable to pay HECS even if they work for only part of the year. We are told that this move will net the Department of Employment, Education and Training an estimated $5 million a year until at least 1997-98 but&mdash;here is the catch&mdash;the savings will do little to reduce the estimated $2,300 million in outstanding HECS payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details as to how the change will affect casual and part-time employees are still to be decided by the government and the Australian Tax Office, which collects the fees through the income tax collection system. As I have said, the coalition is not opposing the bill. However, we think it is proper that the questions that are raised, particularly by recent reports, should be put on the record and consider it a matter of some importance that the government pursue these issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to spend much time debating the finer points of the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill but later in the debate I will canvass the more important, overall issues in employment, education and training facing this nation. This bill is mainly straightforward in nature and will not provide a major deviation from the government's current higher education policies. It aims to correct some inequities which have occurred as a result of a transfer between the Commonwealth government and the ACT government of funding responsibilities for the Australian National University. It also repeals the States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Act 1976, the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Act 1984 and the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989. These acts are spent and, therefore, no longer needed, and can be removed from the statute books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will make minor amendments to the Maritime College Act 1978 to provide minor changes to appointments to the college council to reflect current policy on accountability. This bill does not intend any major changes but is important as it is part of the ongoing process of good government in this country. I would, however, like to address some of my remarks on access to higher education and, perhaps more importantly, to quality education in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In just over 10 years, this government has achieved more in education than all of the post-war conservative governments put together. Their record is of failure to recognise this nation's greatest asset, that is, its people and the effect of intellectual and skill capability on increased productivity, higher standards of living and overall quality of life. In 10 years, this government has provided for an increase in higher education places well in excess of 60 per cent since 1983. Between 1989 and 1994, an additional 85,000 places in higher education have been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This increase has been achieved only through a solid commitment by Labor throughout the period. The opposition and some education bureaucrats, most because of self-interest, have opposed the changes which have taken place, but that is to be expected. These are the people who oppose change just for the sake of opposing change. These are the people who themselves do not wish to have their intellectual powers challenged by a changing world. Considering the response of members of the opposition to the white paper on employment, it is obvious that they too are still living in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts on higher education are stark. Funding to institutions has grown from some $3.3 billion in 1988 to more than $4.7 billion in 1994&mdash;an increase of more than 40 per cent in real terms. The Austudy scheme also reflects the stark contrast between this government and the former conservative government. In 1983, when the Labor government inherited double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, an economy going backwards and an education system in a mess, a paltry $269 million was spent on Austudy payments. This is not surprising to members on this side of the House, because the words `equity of access' have never been in the vocabulary of the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on the other hand do believe access to higher education should be on educational merit, not on the financial ability of parents to pay their child's way through university. This country needs new talent and new ideas, not the preservation of old money and old ideas. That is why this government has increased the level of Austudy from $269 million in 1983 to $1.56 billion in this current financial year. Austudy and higher education funding together now total in excess of $6 billion&mdash;a major commitment by this government, particularly when it is compared as a percentage of total budget outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the House have the runs on the board. The opposition has scored a duck&mdash;a blank; nadir&mdash;and the critics have in the main been silenced. Considering that the higher education white paper was only produced in 1988, changes have been far reaching in a relatively short period of time. Of course, much of that credit can be attributed to the leadership and ideas of the former Minister for Employment, Education and Training, John Dawkins. However, with high profile ministers such as Ryan, Dawkins, Beazley and now Crean, who have held the education portfolio since the election of a Labor government in 1983, the importance placed on education by Labor cannot be seen as token. We on this side of the House do take education very seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With much of the task of revitalising the higher education sector completed, focus is now moving towards vocational education&mdash;in particular, TAFE and schools. Signs of the growing focus are very evident in my seat of Port Adelaide. The new Port Adelaide college of TAFE, situated on the waterfront, is nearing completion and will become an important asset for vocational learning in the area. The Croydon Park college of TAFE has also recently been refurbished and upgraded to a standard of excellence. Both projects were fully funded by this federal Labor government and will complement the already world renowned Regency Park college of TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We promised to provide more places in higher education. We have done that. We are promising an increase in the number of places in TAFE. We are also doing that. The effects of these changes are quite apparent. Many more people in my area of Port Adelaide are now more attuned to the importance of getting a better education. Without this government's major financial commitment, many local people would not receive a chance of furthering their education. I believe their chances will only get better with the expansion of TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see that people I have known for many years who have always had the ability but have never had the opportunity to further their education, because of financial restraints or the lack of access to education, are now studying. Parents are also more aware of the ability of their children to achieve a higher standard than they previously thought possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times there has been a healthy increase in the number of people who have decided to better themselves by taking up studies, many on a part-time basis. They are achieving and will achieve what they should have been able to in previous years but for the shoddy policies of former conservatives governments. These outcomes are purely as a result of this government providing the programs, the initiatives and the capital investment in its own people, as well as creating a positive cultural change in the way we view the importance of education. This is an investment which will be returned to the government and the nation many times over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I firmly believe the next barrier in education to be addressed by this government should be the inequities which exist in our school system. This is the next logical step to be taken to ensure that all kids, regardless of their background, are fully equipped to tackle the employment market into the next century. The school sector most in need of a major overhaul is our primary school system. I am pleased to see that this government, as part of its white paper initiatives, has allocated funding in this area to identify the extent of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated it wishes to address the literacy problems at the school level. At the moment there is no reliable information about the literacy and numeracy problems in our schools. This is information which state education departments would sometimes prefer to ignore. This fact makes it difficult for the government to target resources or access the literacy and numeracy problems facing many students. As a result, the government will allocate funds to conduct a literacy survey on students aged seven, nine and 13. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, as a white paper initiative under the national literacy program, the Australian Education Union and the Independent Education Union of Australia will coordinate an innovative program to train early literacy support personnel. This will be provided through a jobtrain program. If the pilot is successful, it could be extended. Although it is small, on a comparative basis with the major initiatives of the white paper, it will be a valuable benchmark for future gains in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the just over six years since I came to this place, I have never walked away from my belief that it is wrong to let kids fall by the wayside in their schooling, only to be left on the unemployment scrap heap later in life. I suspect that many of the unemployed whose problems we are now trying to solve through the white paper are those who had problems in early schooling. Early intervention in education is certainly the key. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indications are that the gap between the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent is widening all the time. This will impact on the distribution of income in our society and has far-reaching consequences. If the gap increases as it has in developed countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, where there is no safety net in existence like there is in Australia, major social dislocation will become very evident. The highly educated are highly successful. The poorly educated are chronically unemployed. If we allow this to occur in our society, it will lead to inevitable tension and friction between the haves and the have-nots. This is a challenge we need to address to maintain a well-balanced and coherent society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest stumbling block to the reform and revitalising of our schools is belligerent state governments which jealously guard their power in schools and, to a lesser extent, those individuals with vested interests in the higher education sector. Education is of national importance and, therefore, should have a national focus. The infighting between the states is not helping the education debate. Some in higher education see increased funding and resources in schools as competition and a threat to their own public funding base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding gulf between higher education and schools&mdash;primary schools in particular&mdash;is appalling. Primary schools are the basic building block of education. Access to higher education and employment generally is indeed dependent on whether a child is successful in early schooling. We must not disregard those who under current circumstances would fall by the wayside at an early age when cheap and efficient remedial action at the time it was necessary could have prevented the problem in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) is the deputy chair, produced a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS>. It received submissions that up to 20 per cent of primary school children may be at risk with literacy and numeracy. That is one in every five children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, when this was put forward to the education bureaucrats in Adelaide for their comment, I and other members of the committee were astounded at the apathy of their response. The response was along the lines of `at least we must be getting it right for 80 per cent; we must be doing well'. So much for excellence in education! South Australia is usually one of the better states, but these people appeared quite happy to accept that the outcome of one in five children was not worth committing resources to. Perhaps they did not know how to solve the problem. In either scenario, it cannot be tolerated. That is why the Commonwealth has a very important role in leading the challenge in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What some education bureaucrats seem to care about is elitism in the school system. They evaluate educational outcomes on how well the top few per cent do. I am not against this per se, but I stress the point that it is important to measure outcomes by the quality of education received by all students, not just some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe much of the failure in education outcomes stems from our institutions of higher education. They are interested in only the top 30 per cent of students in our schools who may go on to higher education. There is a reluctance to cater for the remaining 70 per cent. They have for so long dictated to the education bureaucrats what outcomes they expect so as to fit in with their own rigid structures and ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little flexibility in delivery of education for those students whose career paths do not include higher education. When employers are demanding greater flexibility in the work force and more technical and more operative skills, it should logically follow that school curriculums would also be flexible to meet this demand. The failure to allocate resources when problems are in their infancy means that society must allocate more expensive resources later on to try to rectify these problems. These bandaid solutions are not cost effective and sometimes do very little to fix up the problem. I believe that, if we do not address this problem in the near future, the social and economic problems facing us today might look even insignificant. Prevention is always better than trying to find a cure, but I wonder how many of us realise what the cost is to the economy of not implementing such a plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take time to look at what political parties campaigning in state elections on the issue of law and order over the past 10 to 15 years have been saying, it is not surprising that it does nothing in real terms to lift the quality of debate. We have all heard of these few gems that  keep coming up: more police, let us stop crime; crime control,  let us get tough on criminals; more prisons, let us lock them all up; longer sentencing, let us throw away the key; and, of course, the ever divisive capital punishment debate. I am not trying to make a point for or against these issues but asking that the debate on social issues be raised a gear or two. They may appeal to some people's basic instincts, but they do little to improve the society in which we all live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am trying to make is that, if it were possible to change a person's direction in life at an earlier age with behaviour modification which often stems from a lack of numeracy, literacy and social and communication skills, would that not be better and cheaper? It is a fact that around 95 per cent of inmates in our prison systems have never successfully completed year 7. This poses an interesting point which goes to the heart of the problem. We as a community have failed to commit resources when they were critically needed. We in the community would complain about how bad things are rather than find real solutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must also look at some of the other costs to our nation. It is appalling that Australia has per capita the highest teenage suicide rate in the Western world. This is something which is not so well known in the wider community and, if the average person in the street were confronted with this fact, I think most people would be shocked that Australia has an even higher rate of teenage suicide than the United States. It is a national shame. I am therefore pleased that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has flagged her intention to in the future seriously tackle the  issues associated with teenage suicide. I am not saying that interventionist education would stop the occurrence of all teenage suicide, but it would go a long way to reducing it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of concern is drug abuse in younger people. As we all know, alcohol and substance abuse, coupled with boredom and a lack of self-esteem, can lead to dire circumstances. Again, I believe that intervention in education can play a part in significantly reducing this problem. As long as 20 years ago, the founder of Life Education Centres, which I am pleased to say are now operating throughout much of Australia, Reverend Ted Noffs&mdash;of whom I am sure you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After 10 years of never ceasing crisis counselling on drug and related abuse . . . that nothing would be ultimately achieved if the situation continued to be tackled solely at the dire and desperate end of the road stage; and that breakthrough of a positive lasting quality could only come through preventative education of all young children from about 4 and a half to 12 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA>I think Ted Noffs says it all. In concluding, I believe this government is totally correct in pursuing its current education and training policies. Opposition members are still as bereft of ideas and policies in education as they were in 1983, and I do not see any foreseeable hope for them with their current ideology. I do firmly believe that we have the responsibility to ensure that all children in this nation have the opportunity to achieve to the best of their ability. Quality education in the earlier years of schooling will complete the education jigsaw and complement this government's commitment to education in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to make a contribution today to the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. Amongst other things, this bill addresses the Higher Education Funding Act with an amendment. It makes provision for extra funding of $87.3 million over 1994, 1995 and 1996, which is the government's estimate of revenue forgone due to parliamentary blocking of the double HECS contribution for students undertaking second degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings up a most interesting and challenging point, and that is the contribution of the higher education contribution scheme towards assisting Australian students to pay their component of their costs of higher education, assuming that there is benefit derived from the education by the student, the community and business, which will ultimately use these skills. The contribution of students at about 26 per cent of the total cost of their course is certainly reasonable and fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding had been that our HECS system was one of the fairest, one of the most equitable and one of the most efficient mechanisms for allowing students to defer or delay expense&mdash;in other words, taking out a loan against future earnings to support their current education. It appeared to most observers that the default rate under the HECS system by allowing the Australian Taxation Office to collect those fees on earnings above a certain statutory minimum would work effectively. But we seem to have a few problems. We are addressing HECS in this bill. We will address HECS in another 45 minutes or so in the next bill before this House, being the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), and we are addressing HECS in the budget bills that were tabled in this House last night by the Treasurer (Mr Willis). So at the moment HECS seems to be in a bit of a quandary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget announcement that HECS repayments will reflect a proportion of the year during which those with a HECS debt earn above the repayment threshold has undoubtedly sent students in the universities and those intending to be students next year into a bit of a frenzy. Even this morning's newspapers trying to report on the budget announcement make it quite clear that the budget statement does not make clear exactly what effect this announcement will have on students in terms of their repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indications from the budget statement are that, instead of considering an entire tax year, the Treasury or the Taxation Office will, in effect, collect HECS on a week's earnings, a biweek's earnings or a month's earnings which happen to fall over what would constitute the minimum yearly threshold, which is equal to average weekly earnings. If we take that at its word, then we stand a chance that students who work for one week in the year and earn above the weekly wage, which would constitute being above average yearly earnings, will repay HECS for that one week's work, notwithstanding the fact that they are unemployed for 51 weeks of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget statement will today have put in the minds of many students a great uncertainty as to how the scheme is to operate. That uncertainty will certainly do nothing to enhance their educational prospects or their love or gratitude for this government, which operates a student loan scheme. It is, in effect, a loan scheme operated through the federal government's Taxation Office, the funds of which are held in a trust fund by the Treasury. The budget announcement has today confused our nation's students. It has really not done much to contribute to quality higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In that respect, I note that, in his contribution, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) waxed lyrical about the years prior to 1983. Remember that those on his side of politics have been in government for 11 years now. But he tried to blame all the problems in the education system on former coalition governments. It does not wash. It is getting to be a sick, tired old argument. This government, which is a tired government, is responsible for its own mistakes&mdash;and it has made a heap of them. Evidently it has made a few mistakes with HECS because the system, which supposedly worked so well, is now being torn apart and put back together again to the disadvantage of the students whom it was designed to help in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Shortly we will be considering Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which also deals with HECS. That bill says that since 1989, the required HECS payment for a student with a HECS debt whose taxable income was over a minimum level was shown as an adjustment on the income tax assessment for that year. I note that HECS has always been considered to be a debt and not income, notwithstanding the fact that the Taxation Office collects it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We tend to confuse things a bit. The tax office meddles in what are otherwise social policies, one of which is associated with child support payments. The tax office has really messed things up with the child support scheme. I hope that the Price report, which is yet to be tabled, actively deals with the problems set out by the Child Support Agency that cause distress to so many hundreds of thousands of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It now appears that we will cause that same kind of distress to thousands of Australian tertiary students or intending tertiary students. Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2), which will be dealt with later this day&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;The chair would prefer it if the honourable member for La Trobe left the debate on the next bill to come before the House until it actually arrives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank you for your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. The fact is that HECS is being modified today, it will be modified tomorrow and some of the modifications will impact very heavily on employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers will be required under the act to collect the fees as part of their taxation obligations to the government. They will also incur heavy penalties and fines and may have to pay the HECS fees themselves if they make a mistake and fail to collect them. All this quandary does not really help encourage businesses to invest in new productive capacity, to hire new employees or to take on those graduates who have HECS responsibilities. It all adds to the bureaucracy and paperwork involved in trying to run a business. It does not enhance productivity or encourage employment. The government has made a mess of HECS, and I suspect that it will be some time before it straightens it up. I urge the government to act as quickly as possible so that students have some certitude as to their future responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Austudy is dealt with in the budget. Austudy rental assistance, which will require the expenditure of taxpayer funds of up to $21 million per year, will now be introduced for those students on Austudy who can pass a test, who are declared homeless and who require rental assistance. I urge the government, when it frames that legislation, not to make the same kinds of mistakes that are apparent in the social security acts that deal with homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, like every other member in this place, have had many representations from constituents in my electorate complaining vociferously that the act encourages young people to leave home and seek government financial assistance because they declare themselves to be homeless. It either gives them a financial advantage over what they would have if they stayed at home or it is simply a mechanism for breaking up the family. I remind the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) and the government that this is the International Year of the Family. Some of our social security legislation works in a manner contrary to the best interests of families, and I ask them to keep that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Austudy loan supplement has been increased from $6,000 to $7,000. A student who has an entitlement to a grant of $3,500 per year from Austudy may now convert that grant into a loan of $7,000 per year to be repaid through a system similar to the HECS system. That gives an additional $3,500 per year to students to take care of their living and general expenses while they are studying. It assumes they need this assistance because they are unable to get it from their parents or part-time work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government's loan system, as it has been brought in, was designed not as a compulsory measure but as a measure to attract students. It is my understanding from students that they have not warmed to the Austudy supplementary loan system. The take-up rate has been below that expected, and that is unfortunate. The budget papers reflect the fact that students have not taken up this opportunity. The increase to $7,000 might encourage more to do so. I note, however, that a student who takes up this option goes from a grant, which is not taxable&mdash;and that is the end of it&mdash;to a loan which has to be paid back entirely, not just half of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that if the higher education system in Australia expands we will need to find some mechanism to continue to pay for the expansion. If the government runs out of funds to support expanding higher education, we will run into an access and real equity problem. Already in the forward estimates the government is saying that it will freeze the expansion of higher education places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is already impacting on my state of Victoria. Victoria has been told that it will not receive additional funds or places&mdash;and funding for those places&mdash;beyond 1996-97. This is occurring because our participation rates in Victoria are the highest in the country. Why is that? The answer is quite clear. Long before the federal government took over the funding responsibility for higher education, the people of Victoria said, `We value tertiary education. We value university and colleges studies for our young people. We believe that it is to the benefit of the people, the state and the nation. So, we, the people of Victoria, paid for those universities and places.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the federal government is saying to Victorians, `Because you have done such a good and terrific job at encouraging your people&mdash;you have the highest participation rates in the country&mdash;you will now be penalised. All the additional growth funds that there are&mdash;which are not much&mdash;will go to the other states which have lower participation rates.' The other states did not invest at the rate that Victoria did, but we Victorians will pay to let them catch up. It is surely inequitable, surely unfair and to the disadvantage of Victorians. I ask the government to think again on that important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that is dealt with in the budget with respect to education is the funding referred to in a statement which was contained in the government's white paper, and which the government tabled in this place last week. It is called `A national survey of Australian literacy skills'. The project will receive funding of $700,000 in the next financial year, $1.2 million in 1995-96, $1.3 million in 1996-97 and that is the end of it. The white paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government intends to conduct a survey of students aged seven, nine and 13 to obtain reliable information about literacy levels in Australian schools.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope that the information is reliable. For some 3 1/2 years I have consistently in this place been calling for the government to do something about instituting a system of national testing of literacy skills of young students in Australian schools, and for very good reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee&mdash;the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, which the honourable member for Port Adelaide referred to earlier&mdash;brought down in this place two reports dealing with literacy: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at work</EMPHASIS> in March 1991 and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS> in January 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at work</EMPHASIS> dealt with adult illiteracy. During our inquiry I took the opportunity to ask those who appeared before the committee if they believed that we were still growing the problem; that is, students entering the work force and entering the general life of the country with inadequate skills in reading and writing. The answer that I got from the teachers was, `No, we are not still growing the problem,' the answer from the education bureaucrats was, `No, we are not still growing the problem,' but from many private individuals, parents and some other active organisations the answer was, `Absolutely.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did support a dissent to the report which called on the government to institute a system of national testing of young students' literacy skills. Specifically, the first element of that dissent recommended that state and territory departments of education be encouraged to institute standard internationally comparable testing of all students' reading, writing and maths skills attainment at minimum stages, being the end of years 3, 6, 9 and 12, and that the results be reported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our inquiry resulting in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The literacy challenge</EMPHASIS> in January of this year, the committee found and stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unacceptable that 10 to 20 per cent of children are finishing primary school with literacy problems. It is also unacceptable that the actual number of children with such problems are not known.</PARA>
<PARA>The government members of the committee supported that statement, but failed to support me in calling on the government to institute a system of national testing so that we could get results and show what a terrific job we were doing or what mistakes we were making. If we are ever going to get the funding that the honourable member for Port Adelaide wants for his primary schools, we are going to have to find out what the problems are to convince the parents and this government to support his calls for increased funding for primary schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, in a dissent to the report, I recommended:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill before us this evening is to make minor amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Maritime College Act 1978 and to repeal other acts relating to employment, education and training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also provides for funding adjustments as a result of amendments made to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, which removed provisions which would have doubled the rate of the higher education contribution scheme&mdash;HECS&mdash;liabilities for undergraduates who wished to study for a second degree at the same or at a lower level. The bill also amends the Maritime College Act 1978 to provide for a minor change to appointments to the council. These amendments will make the chairperson of the academic board of the college an ex officio member of the council of the college. The bill also seeks to amend a number of gender references in the act to reflect modern drafting practices and, we hope, present day attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 to provide additional outlays of $26.135 million in 1994, $30.955 million in 1995 and $30.197 million in 1996. These increases in outlays will be partly offset by a reduction in payments from the HECS scheme trust account of $20.9 million in 1994, $20.5 million in 1995 and $18.9 million in 1996. In the longer term Commonwealth outlays will increase by approximately $27 million each year due to the removal of the double HECS provisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill deals with the amendments to the Maritime College Act 1978.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased in the last parliament to have the opportunity to visit that college with a parliamentary committee. I am sure other honourable members who had that opportunity would recall the presentation that we received there and how well regarded that college is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992 figures show that the college has 1,378 students. The college's principal source of income is parliamentary appropriations, and its operating grant for 1994 is $9.671 million. One of the aims of this bill is to change the appointments to the college's council. Clause 7 of this bill seeks to amend the definition of an `ex officio member' by deleting `Chairman' and substituting `Chairperson' or the `Chairperson of the Academic Board of the College'. Clause 8 seeks to change the act in relation to the constitution of the council. This clause inserts two new paragraphs into the principal act to make the chairperson of the academic board of the college a member of the council and to provide for one member of the teaching staff to be elected to the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some aspects of government policy in regard to higher education may help to illustrate the importance of this sector of the economy and the government's commitment to it. At present, funding for higher education for 1994 stands at $4.7 billion. For the three-year period 1994-96, $14.8 billion has been committed. Honourable members may remember last December when the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) announced that funding for 1996 would increase to $5 billion, and this rise will include an additional 1,500 places in the higher education sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such moves are, of course, very positive developments as they will allow more people to pursue studies that will enhance their skills and thus their attractiveness to employers. The government's commitment to this process is evident when one realises that this increase means that the funds available for higher education in 1996 will be boosted by more than $66 million over the allocation for 1995 and an increase of almost $1.6 billion, or 46 per cent, over funds provided in 1988, when the major reform of higher education took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993 figures show that there are 580,000 students in universities in Australia. Since 1988 there have been large increases in Commonwealth-funded student places, resulting in a 25 per cent jump in the number of these places since 1988. Over the 10 years that this government has held office, more than 100,000 places have actually been created. This is a commendable effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We often hear from those opposite and the media that Australia does not spend enough on its universities and other higher education institutions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another promising trend is the number of students taking up study in research at a postgraduate level. Since 1990, postgraduate research commencements have increased by 96 per cent and postgraduate study by course work commencements has increased by 30 per cent. Plans to increase postgraduate research by a further 31 per cent by 1996 are under way. The majority of the extra places are being allocated by institutions to students who wish to undertake further tertiary study either at postgraduate level or through further undergraduate study. More than 80 per cent of the additional undergraduate places have been taken up by students who have been or who are already in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this is not a ringing endorsement of this government's policies for education and training from the young people of this country, then I do not know what is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In supporting this bill, I would like to think that the changes it proposes to make are very much in line with the government's aims in the area of education and training and reflect the government's commitment to these areas as outlined in last week's white paper and, of course, last night's budget. Members would be aware that one of the major platforms of the white paper is in the field of education and training. The many good initiatives in the white paper in relation to improvements to education and training are far-sighted and comprehensive and will contribute towards employment growth in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, the youth training initiative, the YTI, will ensure that young people gain access to the skills and education they need to become well qualified and therefore attractive to employers over the coming years. Given the fact that more than 25 per cent of the long-term unemployed are aged between 15 and 24, the measures in the YTI are certainly necessary. Under the scheme, young unemployed people will get intensive case management so that they have early help in finding a suitable job or, alternatively, suitable education and training, soon after they become unemployed. They could also receive a place in a labour market assistance program or vocational training and placement with accredited trainers if they are still unemployed after six months. In addition, they will benefit from the new income support arrangements to encourage young people to participate in education, training or work experience activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These new YTI measures are aimed at taking early action to prevent young and relatively unskilled unemployed people from becoming long-term unemployed.

<PARA>It was pleasing to hear him say that his association would work closely with the federal government to ensure speedy accreditation of training programs in order that trainees would have the chance to develop long-term careers in that industry. It is encouraging that an industry such as this one will come forward and stand up and be counted on this matter. A lot of the initiatives in last night's budget rely on a large participation by the private sector. That is important, because it is only if we can get the private sector really moving that we can achieve a lot of the goals that are in the interests of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's budget continued and extended those reforms and initiatives that are important for Australia's future. The budget includes wide-ranging improvements to the delivery of student assistance&mdash;a very important area. It also includes targeted programs for literacy and numeracy, which was mentioned by the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), and a focus on one of the crucial aspects of Australia's future in literacy and numeracy&mdash;the need for a work force of tomorrow to be fluent in Asian languages. The Treasurer committed the government to a $48 billion budget on Asian languages alone, and that is very important if we are to continue to pursue our opportunities in the Asian region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Languages often present communication barriers but encouraging our young people, particularly, to take on Asian languages is one way of breaking down those barriers. The government rightly sees this as a high priority as it will play an important role in developing closer links with our Asian trading neighbours. This government is committed to doubling the number of year 12 students studying Asian languages to 25 per cent of the year 12 population by the year 2006. It will follow on from the Council of Australian Government's decision to have all children in years 3 to 10 study a foreign language&mdash;preferably Asian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's budget, as the majority of the nation has made clear in its response today, is truly a wonderful piece of work by the Treasurer. I have already acknowledged the Treasurer's efforts last night. It was very pleasing to see him smiling so broadly last night. It was obviously a great delight for him to bring forward such an important document for the benefit of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite what must be said were some pretty poor attempts to discredit the budget by some members of the opposition last night and others today, the fact is that it will undoubtedly improve training and education in this country. As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said, strengthening this sector is at the heart of the budget. That reflects the difference between this government's attitude to the future and the attitude of those opposite. It is only by putting a big emphasis on our employment, education and training opportunities, which both the white paper and the budget have focused on, that we can assist Australia's development and hence the jobs that Australians need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of lifting the national skills level, instead of keeping young Australians at school and university longer and instead of helping the unemployed find work or training, what were we going to get from those opposite? They wanted full tertiary fees. This afternoon there has been a lot of talk about the HECS program. I suggest to the honourable member for La Trobe that the HECS program offers much greater assistance to students than the opposition had in its Fightback package and its long-term philosophy about full tertiary fees. Full tertiary fees are not the way to go and it would take us back to the bad old days of denying many Australians the opportunity to have a tertiary education. I think many of us, particularly those of my age, can recall the opportunities that were lost by many people in our day where, as a result of the financial constraints, people were unable to get tertiary education because of the high tertiary fees. But, whilst HECS is a longer-term commitment for people, it does give young people, and older people in some ways, the opportunity to go on to tertiary education which would have been denied them if they had to pay up-front fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the old philosophy coming from those opposite is of full tertiary fees, cut off the dole after nine months and, of course, part of it was slave wages for young people. We will continue to hear a lot from those opposite about how Fightback is no more, but it obviously is still an underlying factor in a lot of people's minds on the other side. Make no mistake: I suppose the policy's name could be changed, but the next one could probably be called `Comeback' instead of Fightback. No-one really believes that those opposite are members of the caring, sharing Liberal Party that they seem to think they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, look at our attitude as exhibited in the budget and also the white paper&mdash;the commitments we have in both those very important documents for Australia's future. Those opposite have tried to make some mileage out of the fact that we have introduced a training wage. They are going around saying that we have stolen their idea. But I suggest that the Australian traineeship scheme has been around for some time. The Australian traineeship scheme has been an extremely successful story for people who have had the opportunity to participate in it. Young people have spent 12 months under that traineeship scheme, with the unions being prepared to negotiate agreements to give the young people a go in gaining some experience in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many times do we hear the story about a young person going along for a job and the employer asking, `What experience have you had?' They cannot get any experience if they are straight out of school. But, under the existing traineeship scheme, they can. They can then go to an employer a lot more job ready than they would otherwise have been if it had not been for the opportunities to participate in a traineeship scheme. I think this is a great initiative by the government and should be applauded by all sectors of the community. As I have said, those opposite suggest that we have stolen their idea. But the traineeship scheme has been around for a long time under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge difference between our idea and the idea of those opposite. The training wage will combine formal and on-the-job training&mdash;a huge difference. While it may be below award rates, you can rest assured that at the end of the period on the wage the young person will be job ready and attractive to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what we have done. In last night's budget, there was an astonishing $1.5 billion for vocational training and education for the period 1993-97, guaranteeing that Australia maintains an equitable and accessible tertiary education sector of high quality. The vocational training initiatives in the budget will ensure that the system is world class. An extra $70 million in 1997 reflects this government's long-term commitment to the sector. This level of vocational training is necessary if we are to ensure that the labour market has the right balance of academic and technical skills required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The student assistance measures announced in the budget are another part of this government's commitment to ensuring that our young people are given all reasonable help in pursuing for themselves an education and a brighter future. From 1 January next year, as has already been mentioned, homeless students who are in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy will also be eligible for rent assistance of up to $34.20 a week. The honourable member for La Trobe asked before&mdash;I really wanted to pick up on this before I ran out of time&mdash;`What about families in the International Year of the Family?' We are going to address that by having family mediation referrals for Austudy and Abstudy homeless rate recipients. It is a private program and will be established certainly to assist those families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) in debates in the House. It certainly is a pleasure again this evening where we are debating the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. It was interesting to listen to some of the comments being made by the honourable member for Oxley with regard to the white paper and the focus the government is putting on, and the spending the government is injecting into, all aspects of training. I think the exact words the honourable member used were `to help make unemployed people job ready'. That is quite correct. I agree that it will help train unemployed people to get them job ready, and it will certainly improve the level of skills we have in the community today. But, at the end of the day, the big question being asked not only by those of us in this place but also by those people outside around the nation who are ultimately going to foot the bill for the $6.5 billion worth of packages in the white paper is whether there are going to be any more jobs. I think that really needs to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot answer that question because the focus is completely on training, on the improvement of skills. That is fine, but we are going to end up with a highly skilled and highly trained band of unemployed people in Australia. We had many questions today and during this week about where the projected unemployment levels will end up. The government is projecting a five per cent unemployment level by the turn of the century. So we are not really getting any definite answers or positive moves from the government in creating meaningful employment for the people we are training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before the House tonight makes minor amendments to several items of higher education related legislation in the employment, education and training portfolio. It also repeals three expired acts, makes some funding adjustments under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and also amends the Maritime College Act 1978. The bill adjusts university operating grant amounts in the Higher Education Funding Act arising from the transfer of funding responsibility for the Canberra Institute of the Arts from the ACT government to the Commonwealth. The institute is now an integral part of the Australian National University. The bill provides that Commonwealth funding formerly payable to the ACT for the institute will henceforth be incorporated into the ANU's funding under the Higher Education Funding Act. The opposition is opposing none of these amendments, although the debate has given the opportunity, as we have seen here this evening, to members of the opposition to comment on a fairly wide ranging number of issues involved in this portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of the Higher Education Funding Act amendments on outlays over the three years is expected to be $27 million, based on the government's estimates that the extra direct funding will be offset by reductions in payments from the HECS trust fund. In addition to a number of language modifications to remove masculine references, the bill will amend the Australian Maritime College Act 1978 to make the chairperson of the academic board an ex-officio member of the college council. A further member of council would be elected by college staff. A number of states grants acts are being repealed, namely, the States Grants (Advanced Education Assistance) Act 1976, the States Grants (Tertiary Education System) Act 1987 and the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Act 1989. As I say, the opposition does not propose to vote against this legislation, but the debate certainly affords us the opportunity to talk about a number of different areas of higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, some fairly unique circumstances have developed in my electorate. My electorate is located in a part of the mid north coast of New South Wales that is rapidly growing. In fact, I would venture to say that it is one of the more rapidly growing areas both in population and economic activity in Australia. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my electorate there are two TAFE colleges, albeit rather large TAFE colleges, which are very diverse in the streams of education that they supply to the region. We have two open access learning centres which are used extensively&mdash;one in Port Macquarie and one in Taree. I forget the number of students that they are servicing but they number in the thousands. The pressure is there, and we are looking to the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales government to develop a university campus in Port Macquarie. It is pleasing to see the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) entering the chamber. I am sure he has received correspondence from my electorate in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting exercise is taking place in Port Macquarie in that consideration is being given to privately funding a university campus there. As I understand it, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have an innovation in your electorate of Cowper in that you have a campus of the Southern Cross University being developed in conjunction with a TAFE college on the same site. There is a very concerned and interested group of people in Port Macquarie who have been lobbying for a number of years&mdash;it probably goes back to the years when Port Macquarie was actually in your electorate&mdash;for the establishment of a campus at Port Macquarie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This particular group of people has now gone past the initial stage and is looking at the prospect of privately funding the capital works to establish that campus. On that basis, a consortium has been formed and land has been identified to develop a university at Port Macquarie. What the group is really looking for now is some commitment from one of the existing universities in New South Wales or, indeed, in Australia that may be interested in establishing a campus at Port Macquarie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been discussions with the new vice-chancellor at Southern Cross University and they are continuing. I believe that the group in Port Macquarie is also going to seek expressions of interest to develop this idea further and to see whether the prospects are viable. I will read from a media release that was sent to me by the spokesperson for the consortium which is looking at this possibility. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Plans were announced today for the establishment of Australia's first privately funded public university campus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior government officials are working with a Port Macquarie based investment syndicate in developing the concept.</PARA>

<PARA>I am sure that this particular group of people has been, through my office, in contact with the relevant ministers in the state and in the Commonwealth. The release goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the 400 acre precinct will also be a privately funded international research centre, a regional shopping facility, student housing and sporting facilities as well as several technology parks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Located at the junctions of the Pacific and Oxley Highways, less than ten kilometres from Port Macquarie, the greenfield site is considered to be ideal for the proposed development.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A spokesman for the company undertaking the university development, Mr Graham Linn, said that it was no accident that Port Macquarie has been chosen for the huge project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Governments everywhere are calling for private sector participation in the provision of public infrastructure. Our initiative&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the initiative of the consortium in Port Macquarie&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will result in Port Macquarie becoming the leading economy on the north coast of New South Wales' he said. `Only a few weeks ago the Port Macquarie region was identified by the NSW Department of Planning as a regional centre with huge potential.'`We already have international support to develop the proposed private research centre adjacent to the University campus. Expressions of interest in participating in the project have already been received from Asian investors based in both Indonesia and Singapore'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`This is an opportunity for Port Macquarie to obtain a public university facility well ahead of any that may be supplied from the public purse. It will also result in a clean, technology-based industry program which will be totally compatible with the city's existing tourism infrastructure. Further, resource sharing opportunities for support services such as sporting, convention and accommodation facilities are sure to create viable long-term partnerships between the public and private sectors' Mr Linn said.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Graham Linn is the spokesman for the consortium that is progressing with the idea of the establishment of a privately funded university campus at Port Macquarie. I appreciate the difficulties, as far as the Commonwealth departments are concerned, with the establishment of university campuses in Australia, with the massive decentralisation of population and the rising demand for educational facilities based on higher levels of unemployment in regions such as the one I represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the minister to seriously consider what possibilities there are for the government to participate in such a venture. It does require a degree of lateral thinking and is getting away from the idea of everything being provided by the Commonwealth, everything being provided by the taxpayer. It would help alleviate the ever increasing demand on resources as far as the Commonwealth is concerned&mdash;which we are made aware of on a daily basis by the government. This is certainly one area that I think we could look at&mdash;the possibility of a joint venture between the Commonwealth and the private sector. I am sure that the minister at the table is aware of the situation and the interest in the Port Macquarie area for the development of a university campus. Hopefully, over the coming years, that will progress further down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had the pleasure of hosting a visit by the shadow minister for rural and regional development, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), to my electorate. We had discussions on regional development with a number of interested groups throughout the electorate. One of the groups that we did have discussions with in Port Macquarie was the group that is proposing the privately funded university there. It is interesting that when you discuss matters pertaining to regional development a lot of members of the general public have a fairly narrow view of it and think that it is basically about economic development of an area and trying to get industry to decentralise to an area to provide more jobs. Certainly, that generally is the hub of the regional development argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's white paper which was released last week, for all intents and purposes, probably paid only a bit of lip-service to genuine regional development across Australia. There was $150 million to be allocated, of which I think at least 50 per cent was going to be allocated to Badgerys Creek. What came out of the discussions that we had with the group that is proposing the building of this university in Port Macquarie is that education really is an integral part of regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated at the start of my address this evening, we do have in my electorate quite good educational facilities, to the level of TAFE. As most members would be aware, TAFE now is looking at structuring a lot of its courses, a lot of its curriculum, so that they can be integrated with higher levels of tertiary education and can be used as a stepping stone to higher education in universities. The natural progression in the development of educational facilities in my electorate now seems to rest on the development of a university campus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that we cannot have one in every town up and down the coast; they must be strategically located. A campus has been established at Lismore&mdash;it is not in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, but it is not far from it; further down the coast there is one at Coffs Harbour, and then there is a fairly large gap between it and the Newcastle University. That is why the private consortium is putting forward this proposition for Port Macquarie, which I am sure the minister will give serious consideration to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back to what I was saying before, education is an absolutely vital part of regional development. There is nothing that government can do to try to manipulate the flow of people into regional Australia, particularly along the eastern seaboard of New South Wales. We must identify the fact that we have to provide the services. If we are looking at getting industry to relocate and develop in regional Australia, we have to look at what attracts them: it is infrastructure, lifestyle and economic imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If an industry is considering relocating into a regional area, people will say, `Where will we educate our children? Will our children go through a secondary school system and then on to higher education? Will they then have to leave and go back to some of the major metropolitan areas?' It certainly is a disincentive for the executives of those companies looking at moving to regional Australia when the educational resources, particularly with respect to higher education, are a little thin on the ground. On that basis, I implore the minister to seriously consider the proposition that has been put before him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was invited to attend the Tertiary Education Association annual dinner and graduation night that is being held next month, but unfortunately he cannot attend. I am sure he would have made every attempt to be there if it were possible. Higher education is very high on the agenda of everybody concerned in Port Macquarie. I certainly support what these people are trying to do. As I said, it is lateral thinking. If we could get more of that across Australia, then we might get a bit further down the road with regard to servicing the needs and easing the burden on the resources of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard in the media and in this place a lot of criticism of the government as far as assets sales are concerned. I suppose it is fair enough to say that sometimes one might agree with the view that the government should not be involved in a lot of government business enterprises or trading enterprises and that maybe they should be sold to the private sector. My attitude is that, if the government is going to sell a capital asset, that income should be rolled over into some other capital asset. I put it to the government that, if it is going to sell $2 1/2 billion worth of Commonwealth assets this year, instead of throwing the money into a spending program or reducing the budget deficit in the short term, that money should be rolled back into other Commonwealth government capital assets. Why not roll that money back into capital assets in the education system? Why not roll it back into capital assets in the health system? We saw increased funding in a couple of health programs. We did not see any increase in funding for the building of capital assets to provide health services throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of minutes of my speech, I would like to get across another issue which has caused concern in the community, and that is higher education and Austudy. At the end of last year and early this year my staff spent a lot of time with students from my electorate. They had made all the inquiries about Austudy last year and had sent in their applications. Everything was right. Then, all of a sudden, at the start of the university semester this year, we were getting phone call after phone call from students, particularly in Sydney, whose Austudy had been cut off because of anomalies that had arisen due to the changes that were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous speakers on the other side were waving the flag and saying what a fantastic job the government was doing in this regard. However, there have been some gaps in Austudy. This year in particular students have been caused a lot of problems because of the way the department has dealt with those changes to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's budget was highly rhetorical and probably a bit low on substance. The government plans to tighten up eligibility for Austudy, costing students $10.7 million in 1995-96 and over $11 million in the following two years. This will be done by basing the income test on known income for the financial year rather than for the full calendar year. All parents should be concerned that the government is widening the poverty trap for students by increasing the Austudy supplementary loan to $7,000. This creates an added inducement for the most disadvantaged to trade in grants for loans, leaving them more disadvantaged at the end of their courses than when they started. The government expects to make $7 million out of the poorer students in this way in 1994-95, rising to $1.5 million in 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is spending a mere pittance on funding for early literacy. The government is spending less than $3 million in 1994-95, divided up amongst almost one million of the nation's children from kindergarten to year 3, yet it is spending $21 million on its teacher union mates. Expenditure is up from $9.1 million last year in the guise of professional development. So there are still a lot of questions to be asked. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This has been a good debate, albeit wide ranging. It has gone well beyond the matters dealt with in the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Amendment Bill. But that is fine. I always welcome wide ranging debates on education. People discussed the pressures associated with the higher education sector, the higher education contribution scheme in general and changes to the Austudy program announced in the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind the time, I should concentrate on those matters which directly concern this bill. The opposition should be aware, if it is not already, of the effect of what it did in the Senate in refusing passage of legislation to institute a double rate of higher education contribution scheme, or HECS, contributions for those pursuing second degrees at the same or lower rate than the degree already held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff made reference to representations from those allegedly disadvantaged by this step. Disadvantage in these matters often tends to be a matter of self-definition and, more often than not, involves such groups seeking other people to pay for benefits that they are to receive. I am informed that over 11,000 people were likely to be affected in this academic year by that measure which was defeated in the Senate. The opposition ought to realise that, by doing what it did in the Senate, it has displaced up to 11,000 school leavers from higher education. In other words, the opposition ought to realise that it has been contributing to what the honourable member for Moncrieff referred to as huge pressure on universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, if people are joining the queue for a second degree and are displacing people leaving school who intend to go to university but who cannot because their places have been taken by those who have been accepted to do a second degree and there is no disincentive, as was proposed by the government, I think those responsible for removing that proposed disincentive have to bear the responsibility. So every time we hear a remark in this place about unmet demand from school leavers for higher education places and every time we see a story in the newspaper, as one frequently does around January and February each year, about qualified school leavers unable to gain higher education places, we will be reminding both them and the public in general that the opposition has made a contribution to this by its defeat of that measure in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Lyne. The honourable member for La Trobe is very proud of a university campus which is opening at Berwick in his electorate. The honourable member for Lyne is very keen to see a university campus develop at Port Macquarie in his electorate. I think it is great that members have an interest in promoting the development of post-secondary education in their electorates. But those two honourable members in particular should remember that their contribution as members of the opposition to the pressure on higher education places by what they did in defeating the double HECS measure is making those developments and the placement of higher education places in their electorates less likely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the honourable member for Lyne, I am a firm supporter of decentralisation of higher education, as I know you are, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker. You and I would have grown up and perhaps attended university at a time when university places were centralised largely in the capital cities of Australia, as a consequence of long years of conservative government. I well remember when, under the Menzies government I think, Sydney's third university, Macquarie University, was established at Ryde, when quite clearly it ought to have been established in western Sydney. It took this government and the Labor government of New South Wales, with the support of honourable members like the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), to right that wrong and establish the university of Western Sydney. </PARA>

But they ought to recognise that their respective parties ought to be making a contribution towards this. They are not doing that; what they are doing and what they did last year has the effect of locking up higher education places in the capital cities. No number of visits from the shadow minister for regional development to the electorate of Lyne&mdash;I forget who the shadow minister for regional development is&mdash;will achieve that. They ought to think these things through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should take this opportunity to underline the government's commitment to provide opportunities for Australians wherever they live to have access to university study. We can all be proud that, since 1988, higher education places have increased by 25 per cent. In the decade 1988 to 1998 the government will have created 100,000 places. But the problem is that during the period 1990 to 1993 opportunities for school leavers in higher education actually fell by 8.1 per cent. More than 90 per cent of the additional undergraduate places created up to 1993 have been taken up by students who have been or who already are in the system. So all of that effort has not served to open up the system to school leavers as we had intended. As a result, the government introduced school leaver targets this year to address the problem. But it ought to be recognised that half the student population is made up of mature age students who are entering study for the first time or who are seeking to upgrade their skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff referred to the government actuary's report and a study by the University of Canberra about the anticipated level of unpaid debt for male and female graduates. I suggest that the honourable member for Moncrieff has missed the point. HECS, the higher education contribution scheme, is an equity based scheme. People do not pay until they reach average weekly earnings. Women leaving the work force because of family and caring commitments will not pay until they re-enter and their income once again reaches that first income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes introduced in the budget last night, to which honourable members refer, bring forward the commencement of repayment of the HECS debt. I think the point here is that it is reasonable to expect that people who have a HECS debt should repay that debt once their salary exceeds average weekly earnings. The change announced last night complements last year's budget decision to collect HECS repayments through the provisional and pay-as-you-earn tax systems. The change does not increase the size of the debt but it does bring forward the repayment. I am advised that administrative arrangements are being finalised by Treasury, Finance and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for La Trobe, in referring to a freeze on higher education places and in seeking to defend the higher participation rate in Victoria, I know is aware of and ought to have referred in his remarks to the broader government agenda on post-school education and particularly the government's commitment to the vocational education and training sector. I know he is aware because he was present at an opening in his electorate recently which I was also attending. I know that he is very proud of developments in the TAFE system in Victoria which have been possible only through increased commitment by this government to the vocational education and training system. </PARA>

While saying how grateful he was for what this government has been able to achieve in the development of TAFE in his electorate, he tended to regard TAFE as a stepping stone into the higher education system.

<PARA>In doing so, I am pleased to speak on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 on behalf of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). This bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects, giving effect to several previous announcements, including one measure announced in the 1993-94 budget. It will also make a number of amendments which have not previously been announced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 January 1994, the government announced proposed amendments to the capital gains tax provisions. This bill gives effect to all but one of the proposed amendments. The amendments relating to the assignment of prospective shares of interests in partnerships will be included in a bill to be introduced later this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments fall into three broad categories:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">first, measures directed at emerging capital gains tax avoidance practices that, if left unchecked, would have posed a significant threat to the revenue at the expense of taxpayers generally; secondly, measures directed at reducing the capital gains tax compliance burden on taxpayers; and thirdly, measures directed at redressing certain unintended consequences of the capital gains tax provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to express the government's gratitude to representatives of the taxation profession for their suggestions as to how the proposals could be implemented to reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers and yet ensure that tax avoidance opportunities were closed off. Although the government has not accepted all of those suggestions, I am pleased to announce that it has accepted many of them. This has meant that some of the proposals announced have had to be modified. Full details of all the modifications at the initiative of the profession or the government were included in a press release issued when this bill was introduced into the parliament. I turn now to the principal measures themselves. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Rebatable dividend arrangements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will counter certain arrangements that involve the avoidance of capital gains tax through the payment of rebatable dividends. The disposal consideration for shares in a company or the amount of capital treated as paid back on shares will include distributions made by the company that are treated as funded out of certain share premium amounts or revaluation reserves. Any capital gain computed having regard to the disposal consideration or the amount of capital paid back will not be reduced by the amount of the distributions that are treated as rebatable dividends.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pre-acquisition profits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will deny any part of a capital loss to a controlling shareholder or associate that is attributable to distributions of pre-acquisition taxed or untaxed profits of the company in which the shares are held. The amendment will apply to disposals of shares made on or after 24 March 1994. This measure guards against a significant future loss to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Value shifting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will remove certain capital gains tax advantages of value shifting transactions involving shares. The amendments will apply to material shifts in value between shares held by the controller of a company and associates. A value shift will be material if the value shifted is at least the lesser of five per cent of the value of the shares or $100,000. The amendment will apply to material shifts in value of shares effected after 12.00 midday eastern summer time on 12 January 1994. This measure will protect the capital gains tax revenue base and prevent a significant future loss to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Disposal of assets without a change in beneficial ownership</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, a change in the legal ownership of an asset without a corresponding change in beneficial ownership does not constitute a change in ownership and hence a disposal within the meaning of the capital gains tax provisions. The bill will ensure that this is so in only two situations:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">first, on the establishment of a trust other than a unit trust over property previously owned by a person where that person, as beneficiary of a trust, remains absolutely entitled to it or would remain so if it were not for a legal disability; and</PARA>

<PARA>Transfer of assets to a unit trust will constitute a change in ownership and so a disposal. The amendment will apply to changes in legal ownership of assets after 12.00 midday eastern summer time on 12 January 1994. This measure has the potential to prevent a significant future loss to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of assets within company groups</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present, a requirement for obtaining rollover relief for transfers of assets within a wholly owned company group is that the transferor and transferee companies are group companies for the whole of the year of income in which the transfer takes place. The bill will alter this requirement so that the transferor and transferee will need to be group companies only at the time of transfer. The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to disposals of assets in the 1993-94 income year and later income years. This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transfer of assets within company subgroups</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that rollover relief on asset transfers between group companies will not be recaptured if, in broad terms, the asset has remained in a company subgroup and the subgroup was disposed of by the parent company. The amendments, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to disposals of assets after 16 December 1992, the date of application of the relevant section. This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Group company capital loss transfers</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that adjustments are made to the cost base of shares in a group company to which a loss is transferred and for subvention payments. The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to agreements to transfer losses against capital gains derived in the 1993-94 or later income years, even if the loss was incurred in an earlier year. This measure will have a small, but unquantifiable, cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Assets used by non-residents in Australian permanent establishments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capital gains tax is payable on disposals of assets used by non-residents in permanent establishments in Australia. The bill will ensure that capital gains tax is paid by reference only to the gains that accrued during the period of use of the asset in the permanent establishment in Australia. Likewise, the bill will allow a capital loss only to the extent to which it accrued during that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will apply only if the asset does not qualify as a taxable Australian asset under any of the other categories of taxable Australian assets. This amendment will apply to disposals of assets after 12.00 midday eastern summer time on 12 January 1994. This measure will represent a cost to the revenue of less than $1 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Division 19A and liquidators' distributions </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that division 19A of the capital gains tax provisions does not apply to in specie distributions made by the liquidator of a company to shareholders if the liquidation is completed and the company dissolved within a period of three years after liquidation proceedings commenced. The Commissioner of Taxation will be authorised to allow extensions of time in appropriate cases. The amendment will be to the advantage of taxpayers and will apply to disposals of assets after 6 December 1990, the date of application of division 19A. This measure will result in an insignificant cost to the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government incentive schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will exempt from capital gains tax the reimbursement or payment of certain expenses under Commonwealth, state or territory incentive schemes as prescribed by regulation. The amendment, which will be to the advantage of taxpayers, will apply to all reimbursements and payments of expenses made under the prescribed schemes. The estimated cost of this measure is less than $1 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of assessments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will ensure that the time limits normally applicable to the making of amended assessments do not apply to amendments that give effect to the time of acquisition or disposal of assets under a contract or the time of disposal of assets that are compulsorily acquired. The bill will also ensure that the time limits normally applicable to the making of amended assessments do not apply to amendments that give effect to the finding that a contract was a nullity from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the amendments to the law will apply to assessments made at any time. However, they will not allow an amendment of an assessment that would increase a taxpayer's liability if the Commissioner of Taxation was prevented from amending the assessments as at the end of 11 January 1994. This measure will result in an insignificant gain to the revenue. In addition to the capital gains tax changes, the bill makes amendments in a number of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Accruals assessability of certain securities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments being made by this bill to division 16E of part III of the Assessment Act will remove unintended tax deferral advantages of some securities covered by the division. Tax deferral occurs because division 16E in its current form includes the fixed component of the return on variable return securities in assessable income by spreading it evenly over the term of the security. That form of accrual is inconsistent with economic reality. For declining balance securities, more income is earned in the earlier years and less in the later years. The greater the fixed component of the return from a security, the greater is the income deferral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend division 16E so that all returns&mdash;both fixed and variable&mdash;from variable return securities will be brought to account under a compounding accruals accounting method. This solution is already adopted in division 16E in relation to fixed return securities. The proposed amendments to division 16E will apply to qualifying securities issued after 27 January 1994. They are expected to result in revenue savings of $10 million in 1993-94, $18 million in 1994-95 and $26 million in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Secrecy</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The amendment, which will not impact on the revenue, does not let the Commissioner of Taxation give the carer's tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">HECS: Inclusion in provisional tax calculation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill also contains amendments to include higher education contribution assessment debts in calculating provisional tax for the 1994-95 and later years of income. This measure, announced in the 1993-94 budget, complements the inclusion of HEC assessment debts in the PAYE arrangements and will bring forward revenue by approximately $12 million in 1994-95, $3 million in 1995-96 and $2 million in 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Offshore banking units</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offshore banking unit, OBU, concessional tax regime has now been in operation for over 18 months. While the government does not yet know precisely how successful the new measures have been in establishing Australia as an offshore banking centre, the number of registrations and requests for advice suggest a reasonably high level of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been extensive consultation with the banking and finance industry and its advisers ever since the government first announced its intention to tax OBU income at a concessional rate. As a result the government has now decided to extend the scope of possible borrowing and lending activities to include gold borrowings and gold loans. The measure will further promote Australia as a viable offshore banking centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government also recognises the need to balance the development of a viable offshore banking centre with the need to protect the revenue. The bill will also amend the OBU provisions to make it clear that a guarantee, letter of credit or performance bond must be in respect of activities of offshore parties and outside Australia in order to attract concessional tax treatment. The opportunity has also been taken to correct some minor technical deficiencies. The amendment is likely to have a positive but unquantifiable revenue effect. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign investment funds and foreign life insurance policies</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign investment fund measures, which took effect from 1 January 1993, are part of Australia's comprehensive system of taxation of foreign source income. Changes in the foreign investment fund measures were announced by the Treasurer on 22 December 1993. Some changes provide a holding company exemption for certain indirect investments in foreign companies which carry on general insurance, life insurance, real property or certain multi-industry activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, activities in connection with construction will be excluded from the general non-exempt list of activities. This means an investment in a foreign company which is principally engaged in construction activities may qualify for the active business exemption. Australian taxpayers who have an interest in the company will not be subject to taxation under the foreign investment fund measures because of that interest. The amendments will have minimal effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently introduced rules limit the general income tax deduction for expenditure by employees on non-compulsory uniforms and wardrobes that do not comply with the occupational clothing guidelines. Currently, a deduction may be denied under the rules for expenditure on what may be called occupation specific clothing&mdash;for example, nurses traditional uniforms&mdash;merely because the uniform could be linked with a particular employer, perhaps by a logo. The proposed amendments will exclude occupational specific clothing from having to comply with the guidelines. The amendment will be backdated to the commencement date of the new rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also decided to extend and modify the transitional arrangements for non-compulsory uniforms and wardrobes. A transitional arrangement operates to generally allow deductions for expenditure incurred before 1 July 1994 on clothing approved by the Commissioner of Taxation. The transitional arrangement will be extended for an extra year so that it will now apply to expenditure incurred before 1 July 1995. This will allow clothing manufacturers to use up existing stocks of clothing approved by the commissioner. The transitional arrangement will be modified to let the commissioner give deductions for expenditure incurred before the actual approval was given. The impact on revenue of these measures is negligible. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Gifts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will amend the gift provisions of the income tax law to allow deductions for gifts of $2 or more made, during limited periods, to the `Weary' Dunlop statue appeal and to the Sandakan memorials trust fund. The `Weary' Dunlop statue appeal will raise funds to assist with the erection of a statue in honour of the late war hero and humanitarian Sir Edward `Weary' Dunlop. The Sandakan memorials trust fund will raise funds to assist in establishing memorials in various places throughout Australia in memory of those Australians who died at Sandakan prisoner of war camps during World War II. The impact of the amendments on revenue is not expected to be significant.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Depreciation of employee amenity property</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Property used by a taxpayer mainly to provide certain amenities in the workplace for employees and their children qualifies for a high minimum rate of depreciation. The amenities must be used mainly for the benefit of the taxpayer's employees or children of those employees. This can cause difficulties where employees of other companies within a wholly-owned company group share the use of the amenities. Accordingly, the law is to be amended so that the concession will apply on a wholly-owned company group basis. The amendment will apply from the commencement of the 1993-94 year of income in relation to existing and future property. This measure was announced on 29 November 1993. The impact on revenue is unlikely to be significant. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Development allowance and general investment allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two amendments announced on 29 November 1993 are to be made to these allowances. One relates to the use of property within wholly-owned company groups so that a taxpayer may qualify for the allowance even where the right to use the relevant property has been granted to another wholly-owned group company. The revenue cost of this amendment is unlikely to be significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other will extend the allowances to property for use in the transport of minerals and quarry materials. The cost to the revenue of this measure is unlikely to exceed $20 million per annum over the term of the allowances. A third measure, not previously announced, will simplify procedures for a leasing company to transfer its entitlement to the development allowance to a lessee. This amendment is revenue neutral but should reduce the compliance costs of leasing companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first two changes apply from the time when the allowances commenced; that is, 27 February 1992 in the case of the development allowance and 9 February 1993 in the case of the general investment allowance.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment will apply to leasing arrangements entered after the day on which this bill receives royal assent. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the 1993 budget measures, amendments were made to the fringe benefits tax and income tax legislation so that certain benefits provided by an employer to an employee or an associate of the employee in connection with entertainment would become liable to fringe benefits tax. The amendment made by this bill will ensure that the method of payment of the entertainment expenses does not change the amount of fringe benefits tax payable on that entertainment.

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benchmark interest rate</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing fringe benefits tax law, a loan fringe benefit arises when an employer makes a low interest loan to an employee. The amount of that benefit will be the difference between the lower interest payable and the interest that would be payable using the market interest rate. At present, this market interest rate is based on the lowest rate of interest offered by the Commonwealth Bank on a housing loan at 31 March preceding the fringe benefits tax year. This rate includes any capped rate available at that time. However, as capped rates are lower than normal market rates, the taxable value of the benefit understates the real benefit of the low interest loan. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will provide that the market rate will be the standard variable rate for owner-occupied housing loans of the major banks as determined by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The financial impact of the amendment will be a gain to the revenue of $60 million in the 1994-95 year and $45 million in the 1995-96 year. </PARA>

It has always intrigued me that those who come from the left wing in Australia have pushed for freedom and elections only in South Africa and not elsewhere. They would no doubt claim that it is because racism was institutionalised in South Africa, as if they expected us to believe that it did not exist elsewhere on that continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a dead black is just as dead whether it be from a racist cause or another cause. Racism is rife in Africa and is usually based upon tribal lines. Usually the dominant tribe rules and rules ruthlessly. Even in countries as moderate as Zimbabwe, after the first election there the Shonas, led by Mugabe, killed about 70,000 Matabeles down in Matabeleland and dumped them down mine shafts. That hardly raised a paragraph in the Australian press.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days, we have seen the horrific killings, amounting to hundreds of thousands, in Rwanda, based purely on racism, and there has not been a demonstration in the streets of Australia. We only have to look at the latest map put out by Freedom House of the African continent to see that there are not too many states that are classified as free. There is only Namibia, Botswana, Zambia&mdash;which I think is a very generous interpretation&mdash;Mali, Benin and Gambia that are classified as free. All the others are classified as not free or partly free. I think we have to recognise this and push forward to eliminate racism in all its forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I dug out an old speech of mine from 1988 about Burundi, which is next to Rwanda. The Tutsi minority was ruthlessly slaughtering the majority Hutu tribe and had killed 200,000 people purely on racist lines. There it was a case of a black minority of 14 per cent ruthlessly ruling the others. They had claimed all the power and everything else, but there was not a protest in the world from the United Nations, the Organisation of African Unity, the BBC, the ABC, the World Council of Churches&mdash;all these organisations were mute. The Commonwealth Conference never listed it on its agenda. There was no anti-apartheid movement or anything like that. I believe that, now that we have seen what can happen in South Africa, we have to push ahead and overcome that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we need consistency and logic in our approach. We should not judge the rulers of another country on the colour of their skin, whether it is white oppressing black, black oppressing black or whatever.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following a number of comments that were made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), who is a National Party member from northern Queensland, Gerard Henderson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> yesterday made reference to those comments. I apologise to the honourable member for not having had the opportunity this evening to advise him that I would be making passing reference to that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gerard Henderson is a commentator of substance. There are many elements of the general point that he makes in that article with which I would agree. But the particular paragraph to which I want to make reference is a paragraph in which he  refers to my immediate predecessor in the electorate of Hunter, Bert James, and the honourable member for Kennedy. Mr Henderson said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Katter's abuse of parliamentary privilege is among the worst although, as I recall, Labor's Bert James was wont to use parliament to dispatch a few hard hits. However, almost every week there are examples of politicians using privilege to score points against others to which there is no right of reply.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that Gerard Henderson has not said in that statement that Bert James was wont to abuse parliament to dispatch a few hard hits. I do not believe and I hope that that was not what Gerard Henderson meant. If he meant that Bert James, as a courageous representative of the people of his electorate of Hunter and of the wider concerns in the Australian community and as a courageous representative of justice, used parliament to dispatch a few hards hits to pursue those objectives, I agree with him. I am pleased to have the opportunity,  if  it  is  necessary,  to  defend  Bert James. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bert James was outspoken on injustice and he used parliamentary privilege, not as a means to attack people but as a means to correct injustice essentially for people who could not afford the expense of litigation processes that may otherwise have been involved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, one of the last achievements of Bert James as a member of this parliament was in saving a Chinese national about $7,500 in solicitor's fees on an immigration matter. The whole institution of parliamentary privilege is an extremely important institution. It should never be abused. I do not agree with Gerard Henderson that it has reached its use-by date. I think it is an important element of this place and I think it is important that members, whoever they are, have an opportunity to raise questions and to pursue issues which they, in conscience, believe should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bert James never had to appear before a privileges committee. He never had to apologise for any matters he raised, and the matters that Bert James raised in this parliament were always well researched. As the president of Bert's federal electorate council in the old Hunter electorate, I was very conscious of the reports that he gave, the reports that he went around the branches to give. He always took up questions of justice and fairness, and they were the types of things that he pursued here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Bert was the person who introduced me to Clarence Darrow and his first publication entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Attorney for the damned</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bert did not court popularity in connection with these issues. He courted and demanded justice. As a result of the issues that Bert James pursued, justice that would not possibly have prevailed under other circumstances very often did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about the Child Support Agency. As the House is no doubt aware, there is an inquiry under way into the operation of this agency. This inquiry has probably been one of the most popular inquiries of all time in terms of public response. Sadly, it is not necessarily a measure of the popularity of the agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in the past five years the Commonwealth Ombudsman has received more than 5,000 complaints about the CSA. In addition, at least 45,000 signatures have been collected from petitions around Australia which call for the scrapping of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often feel as though my electorate office is a branch of the agency. I have no doubt that this is the experience of many electorate offices. My office has been required to act as a go-between for the Child Support Agency and parents, mainly due to the agency's distance from regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the regions, the Child Support Agency is a faceless organisation. Its offices are city based. Contact can only be made through a 131 number, which usually means that callers must wait on the line for 20 to 30 minutes. Parents are frustrated because they cannot speak with an officer of the CSA face-to-face. That is why I have written to the Treasurer (Mr Willis), the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), the Child Support Registrar and the parliamentary committee inquiring into the CSA to request that agency representation be established in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency has a sensitive role to play in dealing with broken relationships and often distraught families. Its clients are often, understandably, angry and upset. This mood is only exacerbated by the fact that they cannot easily visit a Child Support Agency office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency was established in 1988 to assist custodial parents collect maintenance payments from non-custodial parents. It is estimated that the agency receives 7,000 new cases each month. I can only say that many of these clients will only be new victims of the agency's sometimes illogical and often unfair responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring to the House's attention the circumstances of one single mother in my electorate that I met recently. Until about a month ago, she was receiving child support payments from her ex-husband, as was her right. Her ex-husband was employed, and the Child Support Agency had determined a fair amount for him to contribute towards his children's welfare. However, her ex-husband was retrenched, and this is where the trouble began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the news of the retrenchment, the Child Support Agency recalculated the amount of maintenance the ex-husband was required to pay. The agency worked strictly according to the financial year. Therefore, the ex-husband's new lower income was backdated to June. It was then deemed that the maintenance payments which the single mother had been legally and rightfully receiving were overpayments. The Child Support Agency asked her to pay the money back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituent appealed against this decision. While the agency did decrease the debt, she was still required to pay some money back. She was made to feel like a criminal simply by accepting the money which government legislation required her ex-husband to pay. Even her ex-husband disagreed with the move and, like his ex-wife, has appealed against the agency's decision. This is only one of many examples of unfair treatment which my constituents have experienced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When constituents visit my office to resolve a matter with the agency, quite often we find that the agency has made a mistake in its payments system. There are some who, after a long and bitter experience, have begun to believe that tax is the motive rather than the support of children. This often results in families, usually single mothers with young children, going without. The reality is that the agency's convoluted legislation means that children, the very group which the government purports to help through the agency, are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the parliamentary committee is due to publish its report by mid-June. Like many thousands of parents around Australia, I look forward to the completion of this inquiry. I encourage the government to act quickly to look at improving the operation of the CSA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take a few moments of the House's time tonight to correct what might seem to be not a misrepresentation but an inaccuracy in a debate that occurred earlier on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. During that debate, the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) tried to persuade me and the House that the Gold Coast is really a poverty-stricken ghetto on the east coast of Australia. I said at the time&mdash;you might remember, Mr Speaker, because you were in the chair&mdash;that I found that hard to believe, as what the honourable member was asking me and other members of the chamber was to not believe what our eyes tell us when we fly over the Gold Coast.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The honourable member for Moncrieff was quite persuasive in her remarks. I went out of the chamber thinking that perhaps what my eyes saw was not the reality. But it seems that the honourable member for Moncrieff might not have been as impeccable in her research as she probably should have been. I have looked at some of the statistics which she enjoined me to during that debate. It is important to realise that the old story about statistics&mdash;that once you get them down, you can do anything with them&mdash;is pretty much pointed out by the intervention of the honourable member for Moncrieff in that debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member quoted a series of statistics providing comparisons of 1991 census characteristics as they relate to Commonwealth electoral divisions. She argued that I had misrepresented her and that families in Moncrieff were worse off than families in Watson. I remind the House that at the time I was talking about families who needed the government's child-care payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff pointed out correctly that the number of families in Watson earning over $60,000 per year is 4,143 while in Moncrieff there are only 3,176. But what she failed to tell the House was that she was not comparing families with children or without children&mdash;just total families. On the other hand, I was examining the child-care issue and was talking about families with children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate to look at what the statistics in the material that the honourable member for Moncrieff was referring to say about families with children, because that is what the debate was about. If the honourable member for Moncrieff cared to recast her eye on her electoral profile, she would find at table 31b, which is entitled `Parental income families-families with offspring', that 8.8 per cent of the families with children in Moncrieff have incomes over $60,000 per year. In comparison, in Watson, only 6.9 per cent of families with children earn an income over $60,000 per year; that is, 1,536 in Moncrieff and 1,470 in Watson. But the honourable member for Moncrieff compared instead table 30b, and incorrectly surmised that she had more families with children that earn less money than those in Watson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Moncrieff should be a little more careful with her research in the future. I raise this matter only because the honourable member for Moncrieff was so insistent in making her point. She took the bill into consideration in detail, and there were two or three exchanges across the chamber on it. In order to set the record straight, the honourable member for Moncrieff, when quoting statistics in future, ought to quote statistics that relate to the matter we are discussing, not some red herrings, as she did the other day. I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the House this evening the establishment of a branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales in Port Macquarie. As its name indicates, this organisation is a representative body of that section of our community. It is certainly a growing pressure group within the community. It is vitally interested in a number of issues that are being addressed by the government today, including, in particular, those which form part of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 that was debated in the House earlier this day and on which I had the opportunity to speak. I want to take this opportunity to make a few further comments on that bill on behalf of the local branch of the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the inaugural meeting in Port Macquarie&mdash;more than 100 people were involved in establishing this branch of the association&mdash;a number of issues were discussed. There are two that I will mention. The first is the issue of managed investments and the treatment of the unrealised capital gain on managed investments as income, which is certainly having a disastrous impact on pensioners and part-pensioners throughout Australia. Today the government partially backed down from the policy it introduced prior to the last election. We support and were pleased to see that and urge the government to go all the way and eliminate it completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association is vitally concerned about was also addressed in the legislation debated in the House today; that is, the pensionable age for women being moved from 60 to 65. We heard a lot of rhetoric about whose policy it was at the last election and whose it was not. Certainly the government has turned 180 degrees on that issue. I bring the parliament's attention to the fact that the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association opposes the proposed changes to the legislation to take eligibility for the age pension for women to the age of 65 years over a period of 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the federal government has still not enacted legislation allowing persons aged 65 and over to remain in the work force. Even more serious is that workers over the age of 65 years in some states do not qualify for workers compensation. The fact that the government has seen fit to introduce a mature age allowance for males aged 60 years and over who have been unemployed for more than 12 months reinforces the argument that males now have access to a de facto age pension at age 60, yet the government is intent on moving the pensionable age for women out to 65 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A serious anomaly apparent in the legislation relates to the sunset clause which comes into effect on 30 June 1996, exactly one day before any woman could be eligible. As things stand, the mature age allowance provisions are irrelevant to women because at the moment women qualify for the age pension at 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another anomaly lies in the fact that a dependent woman who is married to a pensioner qualifies for a wife's pension provided she is over the age of 21 years. The obverse does not apply; that is, a female pensioner's husband under the age of 65 does not qualify. Surely this is an example of blatant sex discrimination, yet the minister does not appear to be worried at all&mdash;far different from his preoccupation with bringing the female pension eligibility age on par with that of men in the interests of equality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no level playing field. The Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association believes that the proposed changes to the legislation actively discriminate against women for the following reasons. Firstly, women do not have the same access to superannuation benefits as do men because most women are only in the work force part time or have long interruptions to their career paths because of child-bearing and nurturing responsibilities as well as domestic responsibilities. Housewives are certainly still far more numerous than househusbands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, women do not have the same earning capacity as men even when they are in the work force full time. They have not achieved equal pay and earn only 84.5 per cent of male average weekly earnings. It follows then that women will not have the same capacity to arrange as attractive superannuation deals as men and, furthermore, are disadvantaged in that in many cases their superannuation benefits do not flow onto their spouses and dependents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since women spend on average 17 years in the paid work force as opposed to 39 years for men and have more discontinuous work force participation, they are disadvantaged compared with men. There are many women who work, for example, in rural industries and on family farms for very low wages and sometimes no wages. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw the attention of the House to the proposed private label agreement and complementary terms and conditions of purchase being circulated to suppliers to Coles Supermarkets by Coles-Myer Ltd. This is the second draft of these documents, the first draft having been put out in March of this year. The driving force behind the proposed agreement is Mr Brian Beattie, the managing director of Coles Supermarkets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposed agreements have gone out to at least 150 suppliers ranging from major corporations to private companies and sole traders. In practice, the proposed agreements are unenforceable against foreign companies, publicly listed companies and cooperatives; that is, they are only enforceable against private companies and sole traders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden of the proposed agreements thus impacts essentially on Australian-owned small to medium businesses. Suppliers are meant to comply with the proposed agreements by 27 May, with the implicit threat of withdrawal of business from any supplier not agreeing to the terms of the proposed agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the proposed agreements seek to reduce the business to business relationship of Coles supermarkets and their various suppliers to one where the suppliers effectively become subcontractors of Coles-Myer Ltd. The proposed agreements are certainly predatory, and interim legal advice to some suppliers suggests that the private label agreement in particular contravenes sections of the Trade Practices Act. However, even the proposed terms and conditions of purchases for Grocery Holdings Pty Ltd, GHPL, of Coles reflects the bureaucratic arrogance of Coles-Myer Ltd. Clause 1.2, for example, means that no matter what arrangements a supplier thinks it has with Coles supermarkets, the price of goods supplied on any individual order can be arbitrarily altered by Coles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accompanying private label agreement is primarily concerned with Coles defending its position in respect of its own Farmland brand name and the goodwill arising from any development of business involved with that label. This has a surface logic but overlooks a number of pertinent factors. Firstly, if the label Farmland has a tangible goodwill value, this is a company asset and, as such, could be sold by Coles at any time it chooses to, say, Woolworths, for instance, without any reverse obligations upon it towards the manufacturers or suppliers affected. Clauses 6.3 and 6.4 respectively lay out the formula for payment of a fairly onerous goodwill factor to Coles and then a cumbersome dispute mechanism to supposedly resolve subsequent difficulties between Coles and its suppliers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in all known Farmland cases these are not products developed by Coles but rather are existing products repackaged under its label. Moreover, it is not uncommon to find that such branded products are effectively prevented from competing in Coles stores alongside the very same product under the Farmland label, thus resulting in a diminution of the manufacturer's branded market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, Farmland in any case does not exist as a separate corporate entity, that is, it has no stores or warehouses, et cetera, but it is a marketing strategy of Coles to differentiate its stores in customer perception from those of its competitors. Nevertheless, in defence of the non-existent Farmland corporate entity, clause 6.1 of the private label agreement seeks to prevent the sale of a private label business unless a supplier has written consent from Coles GHPL. This is an extraordinary intrusion by one business into another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed private label agreement and the accompanying document are not only predatory but are corporate business bureaucracy gone mad. The Trade Practices Commission should investigate them without delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes remaining I would like to bring to the attention of the House a matter that has been before it on a number of occasions. Members on both sides have spoken about the unrealised capital gains on shares being a very unjust and inequitable imposition on those Australians who have provided, at least in part, for their own retirement. Just recently I received a letter from one of my constituents, whom I will not name, but I think it is worth reading into the record:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I again refer to the gross injustice that occurs when pensioners suffer a reduction in their pension when shares they own rise in the market value but are not sold. On 21 January the Commonwealth Department of Veterans' Affairs advised me that my part pension had to be reduced following a review of my shares. It showed that Austoft Holdings had given me an income of some $2.30 per fortnight. It was again reduced on 4 March when Austoft shares had increased in price and supposedly had given me an income of $23.80 per fortnight. On 7 April they advised my Austoft shares were earning me $36.43 per fortnight. About a week ago I discovered that my dwelling needed new guttering and spouting all around the building. So on the 20th instant I sold my Austoft shares to fund this expense. My net gain will be $721.60 on which I will have to pay capital gains tax. Isn't this a case of being penalised several times for the one gain? As I have previously advised, the gain because of the rise in share prices was a paper profit and should not be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>What I am saying is that, even though there is a review pending in September, what we are doing to many Australians is demoralising them. We are depriving them of dignity. We are eroding their income. </PARA>
