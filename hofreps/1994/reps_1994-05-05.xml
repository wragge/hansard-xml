<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the adjournment debate last night I was speaking on the government's attitude towards the full-time child carer in the home. I pointed out that there is a very major difference between the way the government treats these parents, most of whom are women, and the way it treats others. I also pointed out that whilst there is now a recognition that the cost of child care can be a necessary cost incurred in earning an income and, therefore, it ought to receive a tax concession&mdash;something that the Labor Party has resisted for years but now, necessarily, must give in to because of pressure&mdash;it has, in effect, thrown the baby out with the bathwater.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving away from the assumption that children were cared for at home by their mothers&mdash;in the process of bringing in the child-care rebate&mdash;the government has put the woman who is looking after a child full-time at home into a very disadvantaged position. The amount of benefit that will flow to this woman is meagre indeed and is very severely means tested. Once the woman's income reaches $282 per annum&mdash;that is, less than 78c per day&mdash;she starts to lose the benefit. The point that we were seeking to make, which was very badly misrepresented by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), was that the full-time at-home child carer should be considered to be making a valuable contribution to society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out that the family allowance that the Fraser government introduced was a recognition of the contribution that the full-time mother at home was making. In responding to this, the honourable member for Moreton chose to put all family support into a general category. He then falsely claimed that I had contradicted myself in a debate relating to the capping of the child-care rebate. The government now talks about all these family issues as family support. It has transferred all payments into a welfare situation, other than the new child-care rebate. The family allowance never was welfare. It is obnoxious to mothers for it to be suggested that in recognition of the contribution they are making they are actually receiving some sort of social security payment. The principle is very clear: if the professional looking after children in a child-care centre is entitled to fair remuneration then so is the woman looking after her own children at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I pointed out that none of us have our remuneration reduced because we happen to have a spouse who is earning an income. One would never hear a union leader suggesting that someone's reward for input ought to be reduced because of income from other sources either to that person or to his or her spouse. It is quite outrageous that the principle is enshrined and defended here by the Labor government. I am sorry to say that it shows the government still does not understand the central issues of the right of choice that women&mdash;and particularly mothers&mdash;want to have, which is the right either to be full-time mothers or to participate in the work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I tried to explain to the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) that the government's approach is based on guaranteeing choice for women to participate in the work force or in other activities in society or to stay at home and play a bigger role in the rearing of children. Whichever way they choose, the government has now put down programs in both areas. As I have pointed out, in yesterday's white paper we introduced a further program&mdash;the parenting allowance&mdash;which is going to further assist people, especially low income people, who are at home looking after children. The parenting allowance is actually going to assist 120,000 low income families by, on average, an additional $59 per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the honourable member to suggest that we are not doing enough for the people who choose to stay at home is incorrect. Yesterday she started talking like this before the white paper came out and, after the white paper has come out, she is still talking in the same vein. I find this extraordinary, because the reality is that not only did we recognise this factor but we have actually reinforced this factor in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that, through the provision of more child care and a better child-care scheme, the government is concerned to ensure increasing equality for women to participate in our society. From 24 April 1994, people have also been eligible to apply for the child-care cash rebate scheme, and the eligibility criteria are set down quite clearly in the previous act. In addition to that, there is the home child-care allowance and, as I mentioned, there is now the parenting allowance. So we reject the claim that there is insufficient provision, especially for women, in either area. We are trying to support choice for women, whether they want to go out into the workplace or whether they want to stay at home and look after children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, the critical matter is that it is fine for opposition members to get up and say, `Well, you should be doing more in this area,' but at the same time as they say these things their economic spokespersons&mdash;especially the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)&mdash;tell us that they want to cut $5 billion to $7 billion off the budget. In other words, they talk in general terms about the need to provide more for families and more for women but then, when it comes to the actual funding of that proposal&mdash;the concrete demonstration of doing something in the area of social justice for people&mdash;what happens? They run away, as they did in the last election when in Fightback they had a proposed cut to social expenditures of about $7 billion to $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the opposition spokesperson on child care said, `We ought to spend more money,' but then the shadow Treasurer got up and said, `No, we have to cut the budget this year by $5 billion.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of cuts in expenditure would occur in the social justice area and the social programs of the Commonwealth. If that is the case, it is time for the opposition to show some consistency. Its economic spokesmen should get behind the social justice programs if they believe in them. If they do not, let us not have the opposition's social spokesman coming in here and telling us that we ought to do this and that when the opposition is not really serious about funding these programs. It is about time that some consistency was established by the opposition. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel a need to reply to another matter. From time to time certain statements are made in this House about the Gold Coast. As you know, Mr Speaker, I represent a Gold Coast electorate. Yesterday's debate was no exception. In the course of his speech in this debate, the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maybe the honourable member for Moncrieff, who represents a very affluent part of the Gold Coast, has a lot of these very high income families in her electorate, but I . . . do not have a lot of families in our electorates that earn such incomes.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Mrs SULLIVAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Top marks for reading, indeed. I did not know exactly what the honourable member had said. As I have only just obtained yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I have not been able to extract all the information. All members are familiar with a publication of the Department of the Parliamentary Library entitled `Comparison of 1991 Census Characteristics: Commonwealth Electoral Divisions'. I have responded on previous occasions to ignorant comments similar to those made by the honourable member for Watson yesterday. So I will give members of this House, particularly the honourable member for Watson, some facts about the Gold Coast. It is quite common for the Gold Coast to be denigrated in these terms. Therefore, I feel that it is appropriate to put some figures on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This publication of the Parliamentary Library contains a table&mdash;Table 29a&mdash;showing how many families in particular electorates have an annual income below $16,000. As there are two Gold Coast seats&mdash;McPherson and Moncrieff&mdash;I will give figures for both of them so that I am not accused of being selective. McPherson has 4,947 families with incomes below $16,000; Moncrieff has 4,364; but Watson has only 3,925. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to `Table 30a: Families With Annual Incomes Above $60,000'. McPherson has 2,310; Moncrieff has 3,176; but Watson has a whopping 4,143. Let us look at median family income&mdash;Table 31b&mdash;to give us an indication of general wealth. McPherson families have a median family income of $27,936; Moncrieff families have $31,568; and Watson families have $35,987, which is well above both of the Gold Coast electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Table 31b showing how all the electorates in Australia compare with respect to family income, ranked from lowest to highest median family income. McPherson ranks 22nd lowest; Moncrieff ranks 52nd; and, goodness me, Watson ranks 88th. Moncrieff and McPherson are very firmly in the bottom half of family median income for Australia. Watson is very firmly in the top half. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest it be thought that there is a link between those figures and families with both parents working, let us look at the number of women in the labour force. McPherson has 22,388; Moncrieff has 25,838; and Watson has 23,940, which is lower than my Gold Coast electorate. Table 83a gives the figures for couples who are both in the labour force. The figures show that McPherson has 10,594; Moncrieff has 12,715; and Watson has 12,515. So it is not couple income that ranks Watson well above Moncrieff in terms of family income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at Table 26a showing the number of traditional families in electorates. McPherson has 9,224 traditional families; Moncrieff has 10,976; and Watson has 13,409. So differences cannot be ascribed to single parent families. The statistics for single parent families&mdash;given in Table 27a&mdash;are as follows: McPherson has 2,504; Moncrieff has 2,732; and Watson has 2,041, which is lower than both of the Gold Coast electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us put aside that nonsense about the Gold Coast being a rich area. As I have said before, there is some conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast. There are some mansions built on the river&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) is asking the House to accept something that our naked eye tells us is an absolute untruth. The honourable member for Moncrieff is trying to put to the House and to Australia that the Gold Coast is the ghetto of Australia, but I do not think that there is any way she can prove it. However, I would like to think that she could, because the facts that the honourable member has just put forward in her spiteful little dissertation are the facts that prove that she should be supporting this proposal, not running around nitpicking and saying that the government has got it wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fascinating suggestion that the situation as seen by the naked eye&mdash;in other words, one's impression at first glance as a tourist&mdash;somehow outranks the facts that come from the Australian census. On a previous occasion the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) foolishly made the same sorts of silly assertions about the Gold Coast that the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) made yesterday. Later that day I came into the House and placed on the record the same sorts of facts as those which I have placed on the record today. The honourable member for Chifley subsequently had the good grace to apologise. He said that he had made an error and that he was sorry he had so denigrated the hardworking low income people of the Gold Coast. It was an error that may be understandable because people who visit the Gold Coast&mdash;most Australians do&mdash;tend to do things like take a river cruise, and they see some very beautiful housing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I once had the fortune to visit Miami. I went for a trip to Fort Lauderdale and took the same sort of river cruise one might take on the Gold Coast, because I had been told that the Gold Coast was modelled directly on Fort Lauderdale. Fort Lauderdale housing is very much the same as Gold Coast riverfront housing. I could therefore have come away from Miami and said that it is a hugely rich city. In fact Miami is one of the poorest cities of the United States, with one of its highest crime rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that someone who has been in parliament as long as the honourable member for Watson has could be so glib and could base his beliefs on such false information. The reason certain Labor Party people fall into a trap in relation to particular electorates&mdash;the honourable member for Chifley did so in the past, but he had the good grace to apologise for it; now the honourable member for Watson has done so, but he is trying to tough it out&mdash;is that the areas in question are conservative voting areas. The reason that these areas vote conservatively has nothing to do with income; it has everything to do with standards and attitudes and the actual position of the people affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out that in my electorate I have many young low income families&mdash;I have more than the honourable member for Watson&mdash;and they are on lower incomes than the incomes of the families in the electorate of the honourable member for Watson. Nevertheless, they do not vote Labor, and the substance of this sort of debate is their reason for not voting Labor. I recognise, and have recognised throughout the debate, that there is good family support available for low income families. I have done that on previous occasions. That is not the point I am making. But the honourable member for Watson insists on being obtuse about it. The point I am making has to do with the full-time homemaker who is also a child rearer and how this society needs to recognise the value of that person or that woman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the whole of Australia's history, the women of Australia, the mothers of Australia, have had buckets of lip-service paid to them about what a wonderful job they are doing, how important it is to society and the enormous contribution they are making to the future of this nation. They have long since been fed up with lip-service. The facts are: we put money values on people's contributions when it comes to work. We do it in the paid work force; we have in the past done it in the unpaid work force through the family allowance which has now gone. The means testing of a family income means that you are refusing to face the principle that is so important to those women, those mothers. Words are not enough. There will not be much financial recognition for women generally through this bill. It is the principle: do we believe it or do we not? This particular aspect, the child-care support, does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the other matters that were announced yesterday to which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) referred, I will believe it when I see it. I want to see the fine print. I think a lot of women believed that the same child-care allowance was going to be good for them when it was announced. Many women are going to find out that it is not worth very much at all to them. We will wait and see what the outcome of the so-called initiative that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced yesterday amounts to. </PARA>

This does not, however, require any change to the scheme rules and is therefore revenue neutral. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMONWEALTH RECIPROCAL RECOVERY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA>This bill seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of debts arising under the Social Security Act 1991, the Student Assistance Act 1973 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. These three acts are the main Commonwealth statutes dealing with income maintenance. Each provides that an overpayment may be recovered by making deductions from a person's payments, whether the overpayment was incurred under the same act or one of the other acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to amend the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act to enable their payments to be adjusted to recover debts associated with an overpayment under another act. These associated debts are penalty charges incurred by a person who has incurred an overpayment and who is dilatory in arranging a repayment regime with the relevant department or voluntarily breaks an agreed repayment arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance Act already provides for the recovery of associated debts under the other two acts. An amendment is, however, needed to the Student Assistance Act to take account of a new charge to be introduced into the Social Security Act by the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would add that only a limited amount of a person's income maintenance payments is withheld to recover a debt. Further, the rationalisation of the debt recovery provisions in this bill will not lead to an increase in the level of deductions from a person's payments. The government is very aware of the need to balance a debtor's need for adequate income maintenance with the responsibility to recover debts to the Commonwealth as expeditiously as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the financial impact, the bill will provide enhanced recovery procedures for debts to the Commonwealth arising from income maintenance overpayments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance Amendment Bill and the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill, which we are considering in tandem this morning, are essentially mechanical bills and as such are not controversial. As the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has pointed out, the Student Assistance Amendment bill extends the scope of the 1973 act by establishing a legislative basis for the Abstudy scheme and the assistance for isolated children scheme and extends the debt management regime under the act to unlegislated student assistance schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of overpayments covered by the three main Commonwealth acts dealing with income maintenance. These acts are: the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The changes being implemented by these new acts seem to be no more than an effort at good housekeeping by the government. That is something which we are happy to encourage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I enter only one caveat. I would like some reassurance, which I think the minister did give in his second reading speech, that where students or other beneficiaries have been found to have obtained an overpayment, they will at least be given the chance to make repayments by instalment rather than having to make a full payment immediately. I do not believe that the desperation which gives rise to seeking a loan under these circumstances should be compounded in such a manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, when dealing with supplementary loans we can see that considerable inequities can befall people who are forced to accept this sort of assistance. Whilst on the one hand it enables students to get twice the amount of money that they would under Austudy, by converting the grant into a loan, it also means that the most needy students end up being the students with the most debts. My office handled one such case recently. A single mother was trying to better herself and thought that the supplementary loan would give her more assistance. She thought that she was converting only half of her Austudy grant when in fact she was losing it in its entirety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department then compounded her problem by giving her too much money all at once&mdash;which she promptly used to pay off debts and then had virtually nothing for months&mdash;while offering no explanation that she could understand. She says that the government offers poor students carrots and then leaves them with the stick. She advises other students not to have a bar of the supplementary loan scheme. In relation to these provisions, for example, clause 29 of the Student Assistance Amendment Bill provides:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister may in writing determine guidelines to be complied with by prescribed officers in the exercise of powers under sections 12S, 12U and 12VD.</PARA>
<PARA>But when one turns to the other bill before the parliament, the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill, one finds that clause 4, for example, provides that social security overpayments may be recovered by deductions. But on reading the legislation there does not appear to be in relation to these overpayments and the recovery thereof guidelines which exist in the other legislation. If there are no legislative provisions in the bill itself or some administrative arrangements such as guidelines, whether formally proclaimed by way of the legislation or proclaimed by way of fiat from the minister, that leaves open the possibility that an entire overpayment could be deducted in an immediate next instalment due or in subsequent instalments, leaving the recipient without financial support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the minister said in his second reading speech that that would not be the case, but I seek some assurance that that relates not only to student assistance overpayments but also to overpayments made pursuant to the social security provisions of these bills and the veterans affairs provisions as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to touch upon what we believe to be altogether inadequate assistance for students and particularly for students who come from rural areas of Australia. I think everyone in this country is now entirely sick of that meaningless phrase `the clever country'. It is perfectly meaningless because this is a government which does not reward cleverness. We have a scientific brain drain because this government does not think that science is important. My colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) yesterday noted that the white paper proposals mean that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, our scientific jewel in the crown, is to get at least $60 million less over the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government allocates a piffling $1 million each year for programs to help gifted children. Contrary to public opinion and a lot of popular opinion, gifted children do not just succeed anyway. They can also become drop-outs because the education system leaves them feeling bored and insufficiently stimulated or challenged. So a street kid in Australia can be a gifted child. A kid who has died of a drug overdose at 15 can be a gifted child. Perhaps the piece de resistance is that the government gives people less to study than it does to do nothing. In this connection I would like to read a letter that was written to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) recently and passed on to me by a young Chinese student who is a recent immigrant to this country. She says in her letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Hewson,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to raise two issues about Austudy to your attention. I believe the existing policy is unfair and stupid and is against Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, at present the payment rate for Jobstart for a single person over 21 is $293.40 plus $40 to $60 rent relief a fortnight from the Department of Social Security. The Austudy rate for the same person is $241.50 without rent assistance from the Austudy office. So there is a disgraceful gap of $91.90 to $110.90 per fortnight between a hard-working student and an unemployed person, who may be a professional dole bludger.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dole and Austudy, as parts of the welfare system, both are provided for the purpose of maintaining every Australian a minimum level of livelihood with dignity and equal sharing of social wealth, based on Christian and humanitarian compassion. But Austudy fails.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a heavy study loan, he or she is less likely to be able to do a part-time job to supplement the Austudy. A student has to pay $2,250 for HECS every year, over $500 for expensive books and study materials. Studying at the campus means spending more money on transport and food bills, while a dole bludger sits at home doing nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can you expect a full-time student to live on $120 a week with dignity? University residential full accommodation ranges from $130 to $180 a week. If a student chooses to live more modestly, a $120 won't go far either. $60 for rent, $40 for food, $10 for gas, water and electricity, $10 for bus tickets, full stop. No money for anything else. No hair cut, no toothpaste, no shampoo, no Coca-Cola, no telephone, no cinema, nothing. Then you become nobody, a uni. student. No wonder some students have to prostitute themselves by being a guinea pig in the medical school, or donating blood or sperm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ridiculous that a government disincentives [sic] its young and elite population to undertake training for themselves and a better Australia. Shame, shame, shame! Without a well educated workforce, how will Australia maintain a technologically advanced country to compete against low-wage Asian economies.</PARA>
<PARA>How, indeed? The student then goes on in her letter to point out that there is a special Austudy rate of $293.40 per fortnight for those who have been on unemployment benefits for at least six months in the last nine months. She said that, instead of living on unemployment benefits of $165 a week, she chose to wash dishes for $195 a week last year&mdash;a difference of only $30.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What incenses her is that because she worked instead of going on unemployment benefits she is now penalised by getting the lower rate of Austudy for the next five years of her study. So she estimates that washing dishes, going out and getting a job, for $195 a week last year will cost her $6,747 over the next five years. She concludes her letter by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no difference between the two same poor students with the same financial difficulty. One has been working, another has been on the dole. The working one certainly deserves no less amount of Austudy than the latter one. . . with such a policy of stupidity, how can a clever country not be stupid, and how can a lucky country not run out of luck? It is against Australia's national interest.</PARA>
<PARA>This student, who is new to our shores, has written a very powerful condemnation of the present system of student assistance under this government. She echoes the complaints that have been heard daily in this country's electorate offices. The coalition electorate offices constantly deal with people who want to further their education but due to government regulations find themselves unable to gain any financial assistance so they can live whilst studying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very many people who are on unemployment benefits who find themselves unable to study because they cannot get assistance. HECS deals only with student fees. People still have to find the $7,000 or $8,000 a year just to live if they need to live away from home, as do most rural students who wish to go on to higher or further studies in Australia. This is an acute problem at the present time for many country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been told, for example, of a Gippsland family where the man earns $40,000 a year and has five children. Forty thousand dollars is not a lot of money and is certainly not a lot when it is distributed amongst seven people. His oldest child is a clever girl who excels at maths and science. Because he earns the princely sum of $40,000, his daughter does not qualify for Austudy. The student assistance centre informed him that he should take out a second mortgage to pay for his daughter's education. So he consulted the bank manager. What did the bank manager say? He said,`That is completely out of the question. There is no way we are going to grant you a second mortgage.' Why? Because he did not earn enough money. His daughter has forgone her university ambitions and has now gone to work as a nanny. Is this the Labor government's idea of equity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it was announced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training last year that health care card holders would automatically qualify for Austudy, many of Australia's farmers, who have been earning zero incomes for the last few years, breathed a collective sigh of relief. For example, Mari and Richard Pietsch have a diversified farm at Inglewood on the southern Downs, which is 150 kilometres from Toowoomba. They made $1,900 last year after meeting the general operating costs of their farm. For the two years before that time, they had a nil income. They have two children. One is on the land and the other is a second-year student at university. They got a health care card and applied for Austudy on 8 February, the day after the department discovered that all its literature for the past six months had contained an `error'. The health care card provision was not meant to let farmers with assets over the threshold pass through this keyhole for Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So they were told that, contrary to all the DEET publicity material for the previous six months, the Austudy guide and the applications forms, they would still have to pass an assets test in order to obtain this educational benefit for their child. A few days later, they were refused Austudy on the grounds that their assets were too high. Mari and Richard Pietsch cannot understand why city people can tie up their money in large expensive houses or companies and get Austudy while they, with a nil income and assets that have only a notional value because nobody wants to buy them in the current era, cannot get Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently met some people from the country who have had their farm on the market for over five years without one prospective buyer coming to see it. People in this situation in the current rural crisis in this country thought that this government was doing something for them, only to have their hopes ripped away from them a few months later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government has tied itself up in knots trying to explain why it has reversed its budget provision that health care card holders could get Austudy without having to undergo an assets test. When a Department of Employment, Education and Training internal memo changed tack on 7 February this year, there was no public admission by the government. Even though no less than five documents disseminated to the public by DEET stated the reverse, it was not felt there was any need to make a public statement clarifying the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Senator Schacht told us in the Senate estimates committee that the government did not wish to alarm people for no good reason. But plenty of people had reason to be alarmed, because they had made plans over the previous six months and students had embarked on courses, or were about to do so in January and February this year, on the basis of information provided to them by a government department that they would be able to receive Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The decision not to tell the public directly was an admission of guilt. It is also a most bizarre way of enacting government policy. I suppose that if there were a meningitis epidemic, in health terms it would be kept quiet because some parents would, to use Senator Schacht's words, `become confused by believing it will affect them when it will not'. The government has a duty of care in this case to students and their parents, and it has failed to demonstrate any care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government's excuse has been that the change of decision about the health care card does not affect many people. In the Senate estimates supplementary hearings in March this year, it was stated that only 20 people in the whole of Australia who would have got Austudy under the health care card provision would miss out on it. I challenge the minister and the government: if really so few people will be affected, why be so mean and renege on a promise which people have been relying on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that I am looking at the technical provisions relating to this legislation. If it is at all possible to amend this legislation which will implement what can be regarded as the government's policy, on the basis of the documents provided to students and their families by DEET, we will be moving such an amendment when this bill reaches the other place. In the meantime, I move a second reading amendment in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: "whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the Government has broken its promises to rural and regional families to waive the Austudy assets test for health care card holders".</PARA>

It also provides for a range of measures in relation to isolated children and programs such as Abstudy and Austudy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it interesting that honourable members opposite who purport to work only for the individual believe that the government has no role. We have heard them constantly cite the demand of their own constituents, which they believe is to get government off their backs. Now we hear constant demands for health care cards for people on the isolated children's allowance. These are the same people who opposed bulkbilling. It is quite an extraordinary amount of hypocrisy for a party on the one hand to espouse this kind of philosophy and on the other hand to make demands on this government for a whole range of services. I find it quite extraordinary given that over a decade this government has enormously expanded the range of services to students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think nothing is more indicative of this expansion than the student retention rate. All of us know the figures. We now see somewhere in the range of 70, 80 or 90 per cent of students completing year 12, which is an enormous change from the beginning of the decade. While we recognise that schools, schooling and curriculums need to change, this provides an opportunity for young people to be skilled and to participate in the 20th century. Many children do so because they have access to Austudy, Abstudy and some of the other programs, such as the isolated children's scheme. They too need to be part of that wider range and also to have the same kind of legislative approaches as all of us have. The Student Assistance Amendment Bill provides a legislative framework for these programs and brings them all under the one aegis. That is particularly important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must recognise today are the opportunities, the changes, and the demands the community makes and students as individuals make upon our secondary system. We have seen some quite dramatic changes in the way in which secondary schooling and national schooling as a whole are conducted. They become more and more important as almost a quarter of Australia's school children move interstate every year. The states that are still dragging the chain on the issues of national schooling and the development of a national curriculum are denying their own students the right to participate in Australia. Yet again, they are putting states rights ahead of the national framework and national demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing some quite dramatic changes in the way in which schools deliver their schooling and the way in which students are able to access it. Yesterday's white paper looks at other different ways. One of the programs it cites is the TRAC program, which has been sponsored by Jack Dusseldorf and the Evatt Foundation. It has enabled students to work a number of days a week to gain work experience and to have that recognised within the school framework. I am delighted to see that there are even students in this very Parliament House who are on that program. They are not here today, but they are working in a couple of places around here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think those changes are particularly important. All of us think we know about schools and schooling. All of us at some stage have been there, and we tend to think that schools are the same as they were when we were there. Of course, things have changed quite dramatically. The change in information technology is enormous. For example, students now have access to a whole range of computers, to information technology and to bulletin boards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great change that affects our lives is the impact of the mass media. Students now spend 25 hours a week at school. They also watch 25 hours a week television. When it comes to the impact on students and their learning and experiences, I think we all need to recognise that change is here; that change is here to stay; and that the way in which children learn and the kinds of things that impact on children's learning are very different now from as recently as 20 years ago. They certainly are changing at quite a dramatic pace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students themselves are making different kinds of demands. We have seen the enormous range of demands made on the TAFE sector and also on universities. We have seen industry make demands on both universities and TAFE colleges to ensure that what they are offering is meaningful and real in terms of the 21st century in Australia. The expansion in TAFE has been dramatic. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free) has had quite a large hand in that, and we congratulate him on that. I know that people in the community are delighted to at last see TAFE taking up the challenge of moving into the 21st century. TAFE colleges have made quite dramatic strides in working with secondary school students as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week I was at Balmoral high school, in Brisbane, where we launched the key competencies. There we have a school which is operating an enormous range of programs that are also part of the TAFE sector. I saw students editing videos and films which they themselves had made. For example, the work that is now being done in drafting through computers is amazingly complex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us sometimes forget what children's lives are like. I grew up in a house with neither a phone nor a car. When I look around now and see people with their own laptops and mobile phones, all I can say is that the world has changed enormously. I think we all need to be aware of that. When considering the kinds of opportunities that we provide for children, we have to recognise these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kind of employment and the kind of world which children will face are very different now. We are led to believe that 70 per cent of the jobs that will be around in the year 2010 or 2020 are yet to be discovered. All of us who care about our children, our community and the direction in which Australian schools, schooling and education are moving have to be enormously conscious of the change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key competencies recognise that change is here to stay; that we need a range of skills to take us through life; and that schooling, including tertiary education, is simply another step along the way&mdash;it is not the beginning and the end. Gone forever are the days of people entering the work force in a particular company and leaving it 30, 40 or 50 years later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes which this bill looks at are about enabling all children, irrespective of where they live or who they are, to be part of a whole legislative framework which makes the same kinds of demands on them as it does on other Australians who receive income support assistance. It does not matter whether children are isolated, by definition, and living a long way out. Isolation involves quite a different process now. Most areas do have some access to learning through such things as video and television. Particularly in Western Australia&mdash;for example, in Karratha&mdash;a whole range of apprenticeship programs, modules and so on, are delivered through television across the Kimberleys. So `isolation' takes on a different meaning, and people interact socially in a different way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Aboriginal people, there is an enormous change in their cultural life, the way in which society functions and operates, the visions which Aboriginal parents have for their children and the demands their children make. All of us would recognise that very many Aboriginal children have been left behind enormously. The kinds of figures we have heard this week in the housing for health promotion and the mortality rates of Aboriginals and so on are testament to that. We must act. It is incumbent upon all of us to act. The same is true in the education sector, where we see Aboriginal children who have been left behind. We see their failure to complete primary school, their failure to complete secondary school and their inability to work in English. This is something that we must work to change, and we must work with Aboriginal communities to bring changes about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of us have to participate and be able to participate in the 21st century. As we skill Australia's work force, we need to keep changing skills. The key competencies in eight areas that I mentioned recognise that. We all need to be able to communicate. Communication now is not simply speaking; it is an ability to use a computer to a particular level. If we are to have equal opportunity, all of us have to be able to do that. Communication is an ability to be literate and numerate in the dominant language of this culture, which is English. All of us need to be able to participate in that. It is a question of being culturally aware and socially aware, and of recognising the kind of society in which we operate. I think all of us would value the democracy in which we live and our ability to participate&mdash;indeed, the compulsory notion of our ability to participate&mdash;in the political processes of this country at all three tiers of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen in the Prime Minister's white paper of yesterday, there is a need for those three tiers of government to work together to bring about the kinds of changes in our community and our society that all of us want to ensure that we all have a fair go. We have seen the federal government take a role and take a stand in moving education programs along, as well as work with state governments to bring those kinds of changes about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there are some concerns with the Student Assistance Amendment Bill; but I think we would all recognise that, with the level of income support available, poor students for the first time actually have access to education and an ability to access education. All of us recognise that income support is absolutely crucial and vital to students' access to learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important issue of access is making sure that we have institutions, courses and schooling available to people in areas where they live. When we look at the University of Western Sydney and some of the newer universities, we recognise that Australia's population is spreading and that if we are going to realistically offer access and equity to our students then we must deliver courses, programs and schooling in areas where students live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we see an expansion of universities, and certainly an expansion of the newer universities. TAFE has been particularly responsive. TAFE has been able to offer a range of outreach services, it has ensured that it has a range of campuses and it has been able to respond particularly to local and regional demands in providing the kinds of courses and programs that have been recognised and identified as being necessary in areas. I know it will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole issue of student assistance at times can be particularly vexed. We know and understand that some students believe they have entitlements to partake fully of their opportunities. All of us would hope that we can continue to expand these processes. Of course, part of enabling that to happen is ensuring that those people who do not have entitlements or who have been overpaid are penalised and made to pay, because then we will have more money for those people who are entitled to, and need to be able to access, education services to fully participate in the educational process: the training programs and the other kinds of services they want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this bill to the House because it is about ensuring that all people are treated fairly and evenly. It also provides a legislative framework in which to operate. All students&mdash;irrespective of who they are, where they come from or which particular aspect of student income and student assistance programs they access&mdash;are treated in  exactly the same way. But once again I say to the House that students are our most important treasure. We must ensure that all of them have the very best education, and that means having the very best access to education and an opportunity to take advantage of that. That is exactly what student assistance provides for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the numbers of students staying in schools, participating in TAFE, tertiary institutions and other training programs is testament to the fact that the community at large embraces student assistance. It believes in it and sees a role for the federal government in providing this kind of student assistance and doing it on a fair, just and equitable basis. So, as we move to the 21st century, we have to be assured that student assistance remains part of our income support programs across Australia and also becomes an integral part of providing for a whole range of students in a way in which they can access, develop and grow. None of us know the kind of jobs there will be in the 21st century, but we know that there is a basic number of skills and there is a basic level of competencies which all school children in Australia are entitled to have, and we must ensure that they have them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. This bill makes some minor amendments to the Student Assistance Act, on which the Austudy scheme is based. These amendments are as follows: firstly, to provide a legislative basis for the assistance for the isolated children scheme and for Abstudy; and, secondly, to extend the debt management regime under the act to cover other educational assistance schemes such as ATAS, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme, and to decriminalise penalties that relate to a failure to notify change of circumstances in time to allow the department to alter payment to the recipients of benefits under the various schemes. I particularly applaud this latter amendment because the legislation can in certain circumstances have some unintended and unfortunate consequences for individuals who are perhaps less than fully aware of the requirements they have to comply with under the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third amendment is to implement changes with respect to the repayment of benefits under Austudy and Abstudy in relation to eligibility for the financial supplement that applies. Finally, there is an amendment to ensure that the dependent spouse allowance which applies under Austudy is indexed and thus to ensure that those receiving that allowance are not effectively discriminated against with respect to the real value of that allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are generally housekeeping amendments in order to ensure that the act has an overall coherence and that there is logic and symmetry across the various components of the student financing regime that now applies in this country. I  would like to take this opportunity to make a few comments on the question of student financing generally because it is a matter of some considerable interest to me and of particular interest to people in my constituency, because I have a very large number of students living in my electorate who attend mostly RMIT and the University of Melbourne but also some other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look back on my experience. I lived for approximately five years on the forerunner to Austudy, the tertiary education assistance scheme, or TEAS. I was able to qualify under the independent status provisions, which were not a great deal different from the independent status provisions that now apply to Austudy. When I look back on my own experience, I wonder how students manage to survive under the current arrangements, complete their courses and go on to play a full role in the economic affairs of our society, given the restrictions that apply, the real incomes they have to put up with and the debt they have to carry into their post-education lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1978 it took me about six months to battle with the bureaucracy over my own qualification for independent assistance, and I was finally successful. For that six months I had no income and so built up considerable debt. For the next four or five years, I lived on an income that was extremely limited. It meant that I, along with many other people, was forced to live in what I think anybody would consider to be substandard housing. I spent very little money on clothes and other basic necessities. I was left in a position where scraping together an existence day to day was reasonably difficult. I survived okay. I am no worse for the experience, but there were many others in those circumstances who were worse off than I was. They had considerable difficulty putting together the requisite money to be able to survive and complete their education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My parents were not wealthy, but they were better off than many. I wanted to be independent of them, and I was. By this stage I was in my early twenties and was long distant from that connection. By the time I left Melbourne University I had debts to the student loan scheme of roughly $2,500, which was a fairly considerable sum of money in the early 1980s. I also had other debts that had been incurred as a result of studying in higher education. It took me several years of employment before I was finally able to repay those debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was at a time when the higher education contribution scheme did not apply. So I had no debts related to fees for studying at an institution. I repeat my observation that I wonder how those students who are now studying at places such as University of Melbourne manage to scrape by. I wonder what sorts of daunting prospects face them when they finally enter the work force, which is no longer necessarily immediately upon completing their course, and are, in some instances, faced with a mountain of debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, one myth that is prominent in many areas of our community, not the least of which is within the Australian Labor Party&mdash;and it dates back to the 1940s and 1950s&mdash;is that all students are the children of the rich, that the kids of ordinary people do not go to university, colleges of advanced education or their modern day equivalents and that, therefore, any notions of assistance to students means that ordinary workers are subsidising the children of the rich. When we look at the statistics&mdash;the origins of people who attended higher education institutions; the geographic and demographic distribution of those people; and the relatively small numbers of those people&mdash;we see that there was probably a fair amount of truth in that observation back in the 1950s. But it certainly is no longer the case now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still something of a bias towards people from professional backgrounds. But we now have over 500,000 people in the higher education system, and a large number of them are from very ordinary and average backgrounds. A change in mind-set has become increasingly important within the public affairs of this nation to recognise that we are no longer dealing with institutions that cater for the children of the rich. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add that, regardless of whatever other criticisms I may have of policy with respect to student financing in higher education, it certainly is to the government's great credit that the number of people in higher education has almost doubled in the 11 years that this government has been in office. The other point about the class origins of people in higher education is that, by and large, people from rich backgrounds do not qualify for assistance through schemes such as Austudy. There are some fancy mechanisms that people from well-off backgrounds can manage to qualify for because their parents are self-employed and can get them independent status perhaps when they should not, but they will always be a tiny minority. Efforts are always made to prevent that sort of thing from occurring. By and large, people from wealthy backgrounds do not qualify for the assistance. The assistance goes where it is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem we now have, which is very clearly linked to the unemployment circumstances that yesterday's white paper is targeted towards, is that a recent investigation by the Australian Government Actuary found that 16 1/2 per cent of graduates would be unlikely to ever pay off their HECS debts and that the Commonwealth should write off approximately $376 million of HECS debts as bad debts. Degrees are no longer the automatic meal ticket that they once were for many people. For example, approximately half of law graduates are now unemployed six months after having completed their course. When I completed my law course, there was no consideration as to whether or not we would get a job. The consideration related to what sort of job we would get. That has changed even in an elite area such as law. It is doubly the case in some of the less prestigious courses offered in higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are no longer talking about a gravy train that is there to provide people with huge incomes for the rest of their lives. Higher education will provide that for some but, for a growing majority, higher education will simply be a ticket to a relatively ordinary, average paid job in the work force eventually. That ought to be acknowledged in the structure of the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justification for HECS that graduates are an economically privileged group and, therefore, that they should pay directly through their contribution for the source of that privilege is substantially weaker now than it was in the mid-1980s. It is still there to some extent, but it is questionable as to how much notice one should take of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of weaknesses in the current Austudy arrangements. The most obvious is that Austudy payments are significantly less than unemployment benefits. Students often have more costs. I agree that people who are unemployed have substantial costs due to jobsearch activities and the like, but students often also have substantial costs that are not covered by Austudy arrangements. For example, one of my constituents is undertaking a textile design course. She is very highly motivated, but she has been having financial difficulties. She is having extreme problems finding the roughly $1,000 a year that she needs to pay for materials, such as paints, that are relevant to her course. These are the sorts of things that many students have to deal with on an income that is lower than the unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an obvious disincentive for people who are unemployed to return to study when the Austudy payment is lower. As the pot of gold is no longer at the end of the rainbow, as I have indicated, that disincentive is now magnified with the doubt as to whether going back to study and completing a degree, a diploma or whatever will substantially enhance that person's employability. That clearly is a problem that we need to address. Having incentives for people to upgrade their skills and get further qualifications to become more employable is obviously critically important to the employment prospects of people in this country. It is something that was central to the white paper released yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I still see in my electorate many of the problems associated with the low levels of assistance provided through Austudy. I see people who are very motivated and committed to performing well, getting their degrees and going onto bigger and better things, but who are literally struggling to pay the rent and afford the basic necessities of life. I ask the government to pay some serious attention to trying to lift the level of Austudy. The guidelines for independent Austudy are still too tight, particularly in a period of high unemployment. Many students who do not get parental support and who are genuinely independent of their parents are unable to qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who are on Austudy do not automatically qualify for health care cards. Yes, it is true that many of the services that are accessible to people on health care cards, such as dental services, are actually accessible in some institutions to students at those institutions. It is necessary to qualify that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students who are working part time cannot claim self-education expenses as tax deductions even though, quite clearly, the costs that they are incurring with respect to their education are related to their ability to earn future income. Those who are on Austudy have the capacity to claim those expenses as tax deductions but there are many people who do not qualify for Austudy, who are by no means well off and who do not have the ability to claim self-education expenses as tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students do not get rent assistance. Particularly in inner city areas, such as the one that I represent, rental costs can be extremely high. I applaud wholeheartedly the initiative in yesterday's white paper which provides people who are eligible for unemployment benefits with the opportunity to receive up to $500 or $1,000 in advance in order to allow them to pay, effectively, start-up costs, such as costs for tools and materials. This initiative provides yet another gap between the effective level of unemployment benefits assistance and Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems are also exacerbated by the rapid and unregulated growth of fees on many campuses. It is extremely disturbing to see that some vice-chancellors have been promoting the notion that domestic students should be able to buy their way into our higher education institutions by paying full fees, even if their secondary education results do not qualify them. This totally misconceives the nature of the overseas student intake that occurs in Australian higher education. That notion would allow us to return not only to the bad old days but to worse than the bad old days because it would create a situation where people could actually get preference of position in higher education according to their parents' income, according to their wealth, rather than according to their academic merit. The tiny enrolments in private higher education institutions, such as Bond University, tend to suggest that there really is not much of a demand for this type of provision anyway. But that may not necessarily remain the case once we allow it to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was part of the very first intake in Australian universities who did not have to pay fees, courtesy of the Whitlam government. Unlike some in this place, I do not back away from supporting the Whitlam government's reforms in many areas, none the least being in the area of higher education. As far as I am concerned, when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said to the media that the white paper is a Whitlamite adventure, he could pay no greater compliment to yesterday's white paper. Not everybody in the Labor Party thinks like that but I thank the Leader of the Opposition, and may he give us more compliments of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard HECS in some respects as a step back from the reforms that the Whitlam government introduced, but I would have to concede that the fears that I held for the impact of HECS have not come about to anywhere near the extent that I thought. Yes, it has acted as a disincentive for some people to enter into or to continue in higher education but nowhere near to the extent that I feared. But I would make that concession. I would also concede that HECS has provided a significant part of the funding necessary to ensure the massive expansion of higher education that has occurred in this country. Therefore, I fear that extensions of HECS, changes to HECS, could have those effects. I would much prefer to hold the line where it is although, as I have indicated, I feel that there is considerable scope for changes to Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loan supplement that was introduced to Austudy a couple of years ago should be either substantially altered or abolished. This is because, in effect, students who are able to get a bank loan would be better off getting their full Austudy and the bank loan to take them up to the total amount available under the loan scheme plus a truncated Austudy. I am afraid that that is&mdash;and I hope the minister pardons me for saying this&mdash;something like the service that Waltons used to offer. I really think that we should have a close look at that scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What worries me with students and debt&mdash;and it is something that has not been studied, to the best of my knowledge&mdash;is that the level of debts that many students are now taking into their post-education lives must be having an effect on their economic decisions. There are some students who would like to start businesses and the like but the number of debts that they are taking into that period of their lives must be adversely impacting on their economic behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to finally comment on another problem&mdash;and the shadow minister probably will stop nodding when I say these things&mdash;which has recently surfaced in the states of Victoria and Western Australia, which also impacts on the ability of students to conduct their ordinary affairs and live a reasonable life and so forth while they are studying: the push to introduce voluntary student unionism. I speak with particular reference to the Kennett government's legislation which is basically designed to attack organisations that the Liberal Party sees as sources of political opposition. It has been dressed up in all sorts of civil liberties garb and stuff about rights of voluntary association and the like. In reality it is about trying to knock off organisations that generally speaking are run by people on the left of the political spectrum, but not always. Probably 20 per cent or 30 per cent, maybe more, of Australian student unions would be run at the moment by people on the right of the political spectrum, but generally a majority have been run by people on the left of the spectrum and that is what the Liberal Party and Jeff Kennett do not like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voluntary student unionism will force up the costs of many ordinary student services that students, particularly lower income students, rely on&mdash;such as student catering services that are subsidised. The higher costs resulting from the pursuit of an obscure ideological obsession that really relates to nothing other than political advantage for the Liberal Party would add yet another financial burden on the students. That has been shown by recent internal documents from the Liberal Party which indicate quite clearly that that is what the agenda is. In answer to a question I raised in this House a couple of months ago, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) referred to a leaflet which gave a Liberal Party phone number as a return phone number for students for voluntary student unionism. It is quite clear what the campaign is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have participated in ballots with students at Melbourne university about voluntary student unionism. An overwhelming majority&mdash;two-thirds or thereabouts&mdash;supported compulsory student unionism. That was some time ago but I venture to suggest that equivalent ballots now would produce the same result. We also see that, through legislation, Victoria is deciding that certain activities currently done by student organisations can be the subject of compulsory fees without membership and without rights of representations, and certain activities cannot. The classic contrast can be drawn between sport and theatre. Student sport can and will be the subject of a compulsory levy which people who have no interest in sport will have to pay, but student theatre cannot be because student theatre has to be voluntary. This may give us cause to reflect on the philistine nature of the Kennett government, but it does indicate that we have a totally arbitrary basis for deciding that certain compulsorily levied fees for certain events and certain activities are okay and others are not. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure today to support my colleague the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) and others from this side in this debate because, again, these are initiatives that we are proud of. I was most interested to hear the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) and I must admit I am becoming increasingly wary when members of the opposition stand up and say, `We are not going to oppose this; it is only a housekeeping bill' and then they proceed to attack initiatives of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would remind the honourable member for Menzies that this year our government will contribute $3 billion to school education. That is something that we are proud of. It is an unprecedented amount that is being expended by a federal government on school education, and I would ask him to compare that to the record of the Kennett government in Victoria in particular and the Greiner-Fahey government in New South Wales and what their effect has been on delivering school services in those two states. Over the past 12 months in Victoria, and a longer period in New South Wales, we have seen an unprecedented attack on school education by those governments. When I talk about school education there, I talk about state education: the delivery of educational services to the ordinary children, the ordinary people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been a teacher for some 30 years in the school education system of New South Wales, I know that children in remote areas, in country schools, are not taught at any less a level than those at any other school. As a matter of fact, the last school I taught in has an enviable record of regularly producing top students from the Hunter region. It consistently gets students into the top hundred of the higher school certificate in New South Wales. That is what can happen when there is a commitment from the staff to do their job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last couple of months I have had the pleasure of attending the openings of school facilities. At Maitland High School, formerly Maitland Boys High School, I had the pleasure of being present when a facility, towards which this government contributed $760,000, was opened by the state minister, although of course she did not have the courtesy to invite the federal minister to attend. The state government did not contribute as much as the federal government did, but it insisted on the right to open that facility. Then, only a couple of weeks ago, I attended the extensions to Dungog High School, to which the federal government had contributed $600,000. In a couple of weeks time, I know that the federal minister will be present in my electorate to open a science laboratory, which has been fully funded by the federal government, at the Hunter Valley Grammar School. In a couple of weeks, I personally will be opening a new home science facility, which has been funded by the federal government, at the Bulahdelah Central School. They are initiatives of which we are proud. Of course, when we extrapolate the openings of new facilities from all over the country, it indicates our contribution to school education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be chastened for not debating the legislation before us, so let me get back to the topic. Essentially, the Commonwealth Reciprocal Recovery Legislation Amendment Bill is about administrative management. It seeks to facilitate the reciprocal recovery of overpayments of benefits under the Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. It sometimes happens that a person has incurred a debt to the Commonwealth under one income maintenance act but is receiving an entitlement under another. The Social Security Act, the Student Assistance Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act all need amendments so that overpayments by one department can be recovered by another. This means, in effect, that if, say, a person has received an overpayment of Austudy or any other benefits under the Student Assistance Act, including a late payment charge, and then is receiving some maintenance from Social Security, those overpayments can be deducted from his or her social security benefits; and vice versa. The same applies to overpayments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. In other words, debts will be portable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is a means of recovering debts from people's failure to repay. It is only proper that the Commonwealth should have this right of recovery, just as the private sector does. It is important from an administrative point of view that the majority of these clauses of the legislation commence on 1 July this year. This means that a satisfactory lead time for procedures can be put in place for the new recovery arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that no honourable member of this House will dispute the need for such measures. Debts to the Commonwealth arising from income maintenance overpayments amount to about $1 million in a full financial year. Only about 72 per cent of Austudy-Abstudy overpayments are currently recovered, and this is a significant amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is also the principle involved of personal responsibility, of personal accountability. I am sure that many persons who find themselves in the situation of having received overpayments&mdash;and it is not always their fault; they do not do it consciously&mdash;will welcome the opportunity for repayments that are managed for them in a mutually satisfactory way. We are not talking about a hard-hearted government with a Shylock mentality. Government agencies will negotiate with the person who has incurred the debt to work out mutually suitable repayment arrangements. After consultation, repayments will be tailored to individual needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance Amendment Bill proposes to extend significantly the scope of the Student Assistance Act 1973 which provides the basis for the Austudy scheme and the Austudy-Abstudy supplement. It also provides a debt management regime for unlegislated student assistance schemes. It is proposed that applicants for assistance under the Abstudy and assistance for isolated children scheme will be able to seek a review of departmental assessments by appealing to the Student Assistance Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It will also extend the debt management regime which I have outlined previously to include the Aboriginal student support and parent awareness program, the Aboriginal tutorial assistance scheme and the vocational and educational guidance for Aboriginals scheme. Debts incurred through overpayments of the Austudy-Abstudy scheme under a stay order of the AAT, or a court, or under the Data-Matching Act will now be recoverable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to note that the legislation encompasses several commonsense changes. The dependent spouse allowance under Austudy will be indexed in line with changes to the CPI. Also, where currently it is an offence for a person who has been receiving Austudy and has had a change to his or her circumstances to fail to notify the department within seven days, it is now proposed to decriminalise this offence. A charge of $10 a week will be substituted. It is also proposed to extend the period from seven to 14 days. I am pleased to note that the minister will be able to issue guidelines for departmental officers to follow when they are deciding whether students who have obtained a supplement loan by fraud should have to repay it immediately rather than under the HECS type arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will also be clarified that it is an offence if a person knowingly receives student assistance to which he or she is not entitled. The taxable income thresholds for the compulsory repayment of financial supplement debts will be varied so that they are equivalent to the thresholds of the higher education contribution scheme. The total amount of financial supplement payable to a student will be reduced where the student requests a lesser amount of financial supplement or where there is a reduction in the amount for which the student is eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of these measures may not be considered great. A saving of about $2.5 million in the first year is anticipated, and other changes do not involve additional expenditure. However, the saving of $2.5 million, added to the accountability and the responsibility of the individuals, I think is the underlying concept of these proposed changes. The indexing of the dependent spouse allowance involves no additional expenditure under the act, and the establishing of the Abstudy scheme and assistance for isolated children scheme on a legislated basis are revenue neutral. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance Act, which provides the framework for Austudy for lower income families to attend educational institutions, is one of the great achievements of this government. In 1992-93, it spent $1.438 billion on Austudy; 466,000 Australians received assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Social Security Act 1991 is, likewise, one of this government's more compassionate achievements and one which sets us apart from the opposition. It is enshrined in the principle of social justice and equity of offering a helping hand to our fellow Australians when they need it. The Veterans' Entitlements Act, passed in 1986, affirmed our commitment to the members of our ex-service community and their dependants. Subsequent federal budgets have continued to improve the range and quality of services to our veterans as a continuing recognition of a debt that can never fully be repaid. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two matters raised by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) are relevant to the bills. On the question of repayment of debt by instalment, I am happy to confirm that the rate of instalment can be adjusted to suit the means of the particular person involved. Secondly, the honourable member for Menzies expressed some concern about the administration of debt recovery, given that we are dealing with a number of different acts here. The administration of debt recovery will be different, of course, because it is under different legislation. Officers of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, for example, will be using tabled guidelines under the Student Assistance Act. The Department of Social Security operates under secretaries guidelines issued under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies should take comfort from what was said in the second reading speech on the reciprocal recovery legislation, which makes it clear that the rationalisation of debt recovery provisions in the bill will not be leading to an increase in the level of deductions from a person's payment. In other words, the government is quite aware of the need to balance a debtor's need for adequate income maintenance with his responsibility to pay debts due to the Commonwealth as expeditiously as possible. Notwithstanding that, yes, there will be different administrative regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should deal with some of the other remarks of the honourable member for Menzies, who took the opportunity to chide the government for what he regarded as lack of achievement of the objectives encapsulated in the phrase `the clever country'. I admire the capacity of the honourable member for Menzies to attack the government in such a way without blushing. Certainly he was a fine lawyer; he is obviously a fine member of the opposition if he can attack the government on its achievements in education and not blush at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to remind the honourable member for Menzies and the House that when the government came to office in 1983 around one in three young Australians completed full secondary education through to year 12. Last year, it was a little under 80 per cent. Secondary retention rates have risen to an outstanding extent over the period that this government has been in office. Equally, I should remind him, as the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) did during his contribution, of the outstanding expansion in the higher education area that has occurred during the period that this government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we took office there were around 16 universities in this country, mainly in capital cities, to cater for a relatively small undergraduate population, dealing with those relatively few youngsters who went on to complete a full secondary education. We have revolutionised the higher education system during our period in government. The unified national system now has something like 38 member universities across the country. The undergraduate population has expanded to a very large extent and universities are now to be found across the country, not just largely in capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies also really ought to understand what the government has achieved and what it has in mind in the vocational education and training sector. The commitment over a four-year period of an additional $1.1 billion from the government in growth funds will enable us to build a first-class vocational education and training system in this country, allowing us to develop the skills in our own population that we will need as the recovery continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can remember the recovery of the early 1980s. As the recovery from the recession, induced by the former government, gathered pace, skills were simply not available for industry. As a result, this country had to use migration programs to import skills. With the development of the first-class vocational education and training system in this country, with a commitment of resources like $1.1 billion provided by this government in additional growth money, we have the opportunity to develop those skills among our own population. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made it quite clear in his statement on the white paper yesterday and in his remarks this morning that this is an important objective of the white paper program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly some of the political colleagues of the honourable member for Menzies in the Victorian government understand the importance of this, so much so that they are anxious to take credit for some of this additional Commonwealth money in their own economic statement, which was tabled in the Victorian parliament last week. In that statement the Victorian government claimed some $80 million of Commonwealth TAFE capital as its own. I certainly understand that it shares our objectives, so much so that it wants to claim our expenditure as its own. People, including the honourable member for Menzies, ought to understand that the TAFE system of the 1990s is certainly not the TAFE system of the 1960s or 1970s. It is a first-class system offering a range of opportunities that were simply not available a decade or two ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Melbourne both treated us to some interesting anecdotal evidence on student assistance. I should point out to both the honourable member for Menzies and the honourable member for Melbourne that the question of aligning rates is something that has concerned the government for some time. It is not an easy set of problems because allowances are paid to different people for different purposes. On the one hand, unemployment benefit is intended to be assistance, for a limited term, to people out of work in the job search activity. Student assistance, on the other hand, is to provide assistance over the period of a course, taking into account family income and assets, essentially to give that student the capacity to undertake further study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth student assistance schemes have provided over $1 1/2 billion this year to more than half a million students and the system has grown over 10 years or so. The government at the time of the early 1980s, for example, spent around $300 million on student assistance under a scheme which was certainly more complex than the present one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contrast drawn between the unemployed person over 21 and the over 21-year-old full-time student is the kind of contrast that students will often offer. Almost universally they will not mention that their capacity for part-time earnings is much greater under Austudy. They will not say that their capacity for earning without affecting benefits during university vacations is much greater than that of those on unemployment benefits, nor very often will they tell about their access to the Austudy supplement, which is a very good option for some students who might choose to use that to obtain funds for up-front purposes such as those as described by the honourable member for Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found the case of the father of five on an income of $40,000 interesting. I would be happy to look at the details that the honourable member for Menzies has outlined. We should all be aware that the cut-off point for a student living away from home is $42,487 before one takes into account deductions for other children. The deduction for the first child is $1,200, $2,500 for the next and $3,700 for children 16 or over. On the face of it, I would have thought that the family which the honourable member for Menzies described would have an entitlement under Austudy. As I say, I would be happy to look at the details. I would be surprised if the student assistance centre actually offered the kind of advice that the person writing to him has suggested he received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member for Menzies has used the debate and his amendment as an opportunity to make a point about access to Austudy under the health care card. I remind him that it is a fiction to say&mdash;and it is a fiction that has been repeated in this House this morning and on other occasions&mdash;that it was ever the intention of the government to waive the Austudy assets test for any particular group of applicants. The situation arose as a result of a misinterpretation of the government system, and it was unfortunately repeated in a number of documents. It was not the government's intention to waive the assets test for farming families holding the health care card. The honourable member would be aware that already a generous assets test concession applies to farming and small business families. It allows a 50 per cent discounting of assets and, therefore, enables farmers to have assets of around three-quarters of a million dollars before withdrawal of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not be accepting the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Menzies. Again, I commend him for raising this matter in such an unblushing manner. I say `unblushing' because no doubt he was at the occasion of the burial of Fightback at the Eagle Hawk motel a couple of weekends ago. He should remember that, had the opposition formed government in March last year and been on this side of the House now, under Fightback it would probably be legislating to remove $30 million from student assistance schemes. It would probably be now in the process of removing student assistance from some 30,000 students. Fightback proposed that some 30,000 students would lose Austudy, ripping $30 million out of the scheme. It is not a bad effort for the honourable member for Menzies to come in here and unblushingly complain about 20 individuals who have been inconvenienced when, at the same time, he knows that the opposition has just disposed of a policy that would have removed student assistance from 30,000 students. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront reform program was based on an in-principle agreement, IPA, negotiated between the government, stevedoring employers, unions and the ACTU, and implemented over a three-year period from October 1989 to October 1992, under the auspices of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. As part of the reform of the industry framework, the IPA called for the restructuring of awards and agreements. A new award, the stevedoring industry award, was ratified in November 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision for a general levy in the Levy Act is to be abolished. The special levy will continue to be collected and applied to meet the industry's loan obligation until that obligation is fulfilled. On current estimates the loan is expected to be paid in full by late 1995. The amendments to the current legislation are not intended to change the application of the levy arrangements. In this regard and in the light of the cessation of the registration arrangements which had applied in the industry since 1977, the bill prescribes those stevedoring employees in respect of whom the levy will and will not be payable. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is currently required to maintain registers of waterside workers consistent with the General Agreement of 1977 between stevedoring employers and the union (now Maritime Union of Australia). These provisions were part of the industry-based employment arrangements which characterised the industry prior to the reform program. The provision for registers was also relevant to meeting Australia's obligations in relation to ILO convention 137. At the completion of the reform program, all parties agreed that the registration system incorporated in the General Agreement of 1977 would cease to apply. The bill removes the requirement that the committee maintain a register of waterside workers for these purposes and in relation to levy collection, although the committee will establish a register of names of stevedoring employees, consistent with the convention. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is supremely ironic that the House should be debating a bill dealing with industrial relations only a day after the government's employment statement. The government has invested an enormous amount of the political and economic capital of the nation in the employment white paper that was brought down yesterday by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The government would have us believe that this represents a revisiting of earlier days when a former Labor Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, produced a white paper in favour of full employment. The government has committed billions of dollars towards an attempted solution of Australia's chronic unemployment problem. Yet almost unnoticed, almost silently as if deliberately by design, the government has been changing the industrial relations laws of this country in a way that makes unemployment likely to rise rather than fall, in a way that is likely to further complicate the workplace rules that prevent small employers taking on new staff, in a way that entrenches the rigidities of Australia's already very rigid industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad fact is that Australia has one of the worst unemployment levels in the industrialised world. I heard the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Mr Free), in his response to the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), talk about the capacity of the honourable member for Menzies to make allegations against the government without blushing. I never cease to be amazed at the capacity of the Prime Minister, in particular, to make claims about Australia's unemployment performance, to make claims about what his government has done to tackle that problem, without blushing. He would have us believe that we are like the rest of the world when it comes to unemployment. That, of course, is not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister would have to be the most selectively comparing Prime Minister this country has ever had. When it suits him, the countries that he compares Australia with are the dynamic economies of the Asian Pacific region. When it suits one purpose that is what he does. When it suits another purpose, he would compare us with the countries of Europe and of North America. When it comes to unemployment, we never hear the Prime Minister comparing Australia with the United States or with Japan. He says, `Our unemployment problem is like everybody else's.' It is not. The Americans have an unemployment level of 6 1/2 per cent. When we bear in mind the enormous urban underclass that the United States has in its major cities, particularly in the north east, we have an idea of how much better the Americans are doing with unemployment than we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the Americans do better with unemployment is that they have a far more flexible labour market. They have a capacity to regenerate and to come back and to recover. Because of the flexibility of the American labour market, when economic recovery begins, it is not the government that reaches back and picks up the people&mdash;it is the private business sector of the American economy that reaches back and picks up the people. The only way you reach back and pick up people is to have a business sector that has the right incentives to employ. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right incentives do not only involve subsidies and taxation measures; they also involve the absence of anti-employment workplace rules. If there is one thing that this country excels at it is anti-employment workplace rules. We have just had an industrial relations act passed by this parliament, with the support of the Australian Democrats and the Western Australian Greens and in the teeth of the opposition of both the Liberal and National parties, which actually makes it less attractive for small business to take on new staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here today with amendments to the Industrial Relations Act which in turn deal with the Australian waterfront, the stevedoring industry, which probably in a way is the Aunt Sally of industrial relations rorts in the industrial relations history of this country. There is no area of industrial behaviour so etched in the Australian consciousness and so associated in the Australian consciousness with abuse of privilege, union inspired rorts, bullying tactics and privileges being claimed and conceded by governments over the years as the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth for a moment putting into perspective the claims made by the government that somehow or other it has wrought wondrous miracles over the last 11 years in improving the performance of the Australian waterfront. We keep being told by the government and by the Prime Minister that the last 11 years has been an unending, uninterrupted parade of economic triumph and economic success. We are told about the marvellous structural changes that have occurred. Unblushingly the claim is made that the Australian economy is now the fastest growing in the industrialised world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister who spoke a few moments ago told us that the retention levels in Australian schools were much lower in 1983 than they are now, and he claimed that that was somehow the result of a deliberate government policy. The reason the retention levels were much lower in 1983 than they are now is that 11 years ago most young people thought they could get a job when they left school. They did not have embedded in their consciousness the belief that they had to remain at school because there was fundamentally no alternative. Of course there was high youth unemployment in 1983, but it had not been a decade-long phenomenon. Therefore, at that particular time, the expectations of young Australians were nowhere near as pessimistic. For the government to seriously and unblushingly say that the high retention rate is the result of an inspired, deliberate policy construct of its 11 years in office is absolutely ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We keep getting told that the Australian waterfront is super efficient and that the reforms this government has brought in have been absolutely brilliant. In recent times, Australian waterfront costs have declined. Of course they have declined. It is the relative performance in that area that is important to our economic achievement. Over the last few years Australia's waterfront costs have declined by between five and 10 per cent. Over that same period, New Zealand's costs&mdash;remember New Zealand; the government always likes to knock New Zealand when it suits&mdash;have declined by 45 per cent, and that is from a base that was already lower than Australia's. Sydney's stevedoring costs are now up to five times higher than New Zealand's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said before, we do not compete against our past. There is no point in the government saying that Australia's situation is better now than it was 20 years ago. What matters is whether it is better or as good compared to the countries that are fighting for the same share of the same market. The reality is that this international competitiveness is a never ending race and unless we keep in front, we lose. There is no finish line. We have to keep in front of the other fellow the whole time. The government does not seem to believe that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The port of Melbourne used to be placed 20th out of 40 on the score of productivity and performance. It has now slipped to 34th place. In the areas of manning achievements, turnover, movement of freight and so forth our ports still compare very poorly with ports in New Zealand, Europe, the United Kingdom and the Asia-Pacific region. Once again we find on examination that the government's unblushing claims of wondrous economic miracles are completely false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the more specific provisions of the bill. Unless our amendments are successful, we intend to vote against this bill because, despite what the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has said, it does endorse the maintenance of a register of waterfront employees. Stripped of all the verbiage, the maintenance of a register of waterfront employees is a reaching back to the dark ages of Australia's waterfront. It is redolent of the days when guaranteed employment was regarded as a right available only to the section of the Australian work force on the waterfront. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no need to have a register of employees. We are told we must have this register in order to fulfil our obligations under an ILO convention. Are we to be increasingly governed by the illicit use of the international conventions to which Australia has become a party to justify the disturbance of domestic law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government boasts about the need for Australian independence. This government says we should become a republic because our present constitutional arrangements are an affront to full-blooded Australian nationalism. Yet in the 11 years that Labor has been in government, it has done more to pawn Australian independence than any government since Federation. It has done so in two ways. This government has put us in hock to the bankers of the world. When it came to power Australia's net foreign debt was $23 billion; it is now almost $200 billion&mdash;$23 billion to almost $200 billion while Mandrake from Blaxland has presided over the Australian economy and has given us all these wonderful reforms.

The minister indicated&mdash;I will return to this when we consider the bill in detail&mdash;in his second reading speech that he will tack something onto the end of clause 20 of the bill to try, in a tenuous way, to explain away the fact that he misled the parliament when he answered an interjection, not a question, from me. I am glad that he pays attention to what I say on these matters. He made it clear that the bill would not oblige the establishment of a register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it&mdash;I am quite sure that the minister will be only too ready to correct me if my understanding is wrong&mdash;the minister intends to amend clause 20 of the bill. That clause states that the committee must&mdash;there is no choice; it must do it&mdash;establish a register containing the names of stevedoring employees. His amendment states that if the committee is satisfied that an employer of stevedoring employees is keeping the prescribed records in relation to those employees, the committee is not required to include the names of those employees on the register. In other words, there will still be a register, and a capacity for the committee to require the inclusion of all the names on the register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is saying that, because the committee can exercise a discretion and say, `Since you are being very good boys and keeping records, we will not ask you to put those names on the register,' in some way there is nothing compulsory about it. It is still very compulsory and it is not very optional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We simply ask: why have a register at all? The only reason there will be a register is that the Maritime Union of Australia wants a register. Jenny George, Bill Kelty and Martin Ferguson wanted the Industrial Relations Act, so they got it. This is classic organ-grinder and monkey legislation. The organ-grinder is the Maritime Union of Australia, and the monkey is the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister spent $6.5 billion of Australian taxpayers' money yesterday. Today, the industrial relations minister is worsening the industrial relations circumstances of a key industry in Australia. He is contributing to the low productivity of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> While we are talking about this, we are reminded again of the unblushing claims of the Prime Minister that his brilliant micro- and macro-economic reforms have revolutionised and transformed the Australian economy. We are told about how more productive it has become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that, a few weeks ago, the OECD looked at the Australian economy. The Prime Minister chose to dismiss the OECD's report as being Eurocentric, irrespective of the justification for that claim. He said it was looking at the Australian economy through European eyes. The fact that the draft report on the Australian economy had been run past the federal Treasury has either escaped his recollection or he has simply chosen to ignore it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real reason why the Prime Minister was niggled by that report and why he dismissed it as Eurocentric is the fact that the report made the rather interesting and damaging statement that Australia's productivity performance between 1987 and 1992 was only 60 per cent of the OECD average. In other words, our productivity went up by only 60 per cent of the OECD average. Of all the exams that the economic managers of nations must sit, none is more important and crucial than the exam paper entitled `Productivity', because productivity is a measure of how intelligently a nation uses its resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was some very fine rhetoric in the Prime Minister's job statement yesterday about what a tragic waste of a valuable resource&mdash;indeed, our nation's most priceless resource; that is, the talent of our people&mdash;it is to have so many people unemployed. I could not help agreeing 100 per cent with the Prime Minister's statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are human, financial and natural resources. We as a nation do not use them very efficiently or intelligently. Despite all the rhetoric, fine words and exaggerated claims, the brutal fact is that between 1987 and 1992, when the honourable member for Blaxland was for four of those five years the Treasurer of Australia and for six months of the other year Prime Minister of Australia, the most accurate measure of how efficiently we used our resources of people, minerals, produce of the earth and nature and our financial resources said that our achievement was only 60 per cent of the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OECD is not talking about Third World countries; it is talking about all the modern industrialised nations of the world, such as Japan, Germany, Britain and the other nations of western Europe.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not in front. There is all this talk. No wonder the Prime Minister said the report was Eurocentric. The Prime Minister is very good at that. If he finds an embarrassing fact, he tries to ridicule that fact with an insulting diversion. But a few people around are awake to it. When he was in Thailand, the Prime Minister tried to blow the report out of the water by saying it was Eurocentric and wrong. It is not wrong or Eurocentric; it just happens to be the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I know that the truth is uncomfortable. When a country's productivity performance is 60 per cent of the OECD average and the government that has been running the place for 11 years is running out of a capacity to credibly blame the foreigners and former governments, I suppose its Prime Minister has to resort to cheap rhetoric and remarks in foreign countries. That is what the Prime Minister did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What annoys me and the opposition about this bill and so many aspects of the government's approach to industrial relations is that the government's policies do nothing to lift the productivity of this country. At the end of the day, we will sink or swim according to our productivity. We will never have a big enough economy to hold our own on a head to head basis with the large economic groupings of the world. We can only do well if we perform on the productivity front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister talks every day about the need for us to move into the Asia-Pacific region. He is right. We have been doing that since 1957 when John McEwen, the Deputy Prime Minister in a coalition government, trailblazed into Asia by signing the Japan-Australia free trade agreement. I say in passing that it would have taken more political courage to sign a Japan-Australia free trade agreement in 1957 than it would in 1994 to talk about the importance of Australia's association with Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think anybody in this House should ever forget the fact that we started the move into the Asia-Pacific region. John McEwen deserves more credit for trailblazing into the Asia-Pacific region than any postwar politician in this country. Let that not be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say in passing that I did not agree with every policy that John McEwen advocated. There are one or two areas where, if we had been sitting around a shadow cabinet table together, there may have been a marginal diversion. But, on that score, he showed characteristic Australian guts. He was opposed by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1957, the Labor Party opposed that agreement, which was the first positive step. This hypocrite, who is now the Prime Minister of this country, is saying, `I opened up Australia's eyes to the importance of the Asia-Pacific region. I was the first person who discovered that it was very important to Australia's future.' Once again, he does it with unblushing fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are unhappy with this bill. We will vote against it unless it is amended. It fails to address the fundamental challenge of any intelligent system of workplace relations in this country, and that is productivity. What will this bill do to increase the productivity of the Australian waterfront? The answer is nothing. Will this bill potentially make that productivity less? The answer is yes. Will this legislation do anything to make our industrial relations system more flexible? The answer is no. Will this legislation placate the union organ grinders so far as this government is concerned? The answer is yes. This country is very different from what it was 20 or 30 years ago. Many of the changes that have occurred over that time have been good, but a lot of them have been bad. A lot of the things that we are told by this government that it has achieved, of course, it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have pointed out how poorly we have done on the productivity level. I have pointed out the essential fraudulence of many of the claims the government makes about achievement in so many areas. The waterfront remains a glaring example of just how out of date this country remains according to international best practice. We may be doing better now than we were doing 20 years ago, but in relative terms we are still a long way behind the rest of the world. If we are to have that super-duper international best practice that the Prime Minister tells us time and time again is so absolutely essential then we should not be passing legislation like this. We should never have passed the Industrial Relations Act. We should not be putting a bill through this parliament that will actually discourage the average small businessman from taking on more staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These will be my final words on this measure. This bill and the Industrial Relations Act represent, yet again, a very simple fact: for the last 11 years the industrial relations laws of this country have been drafted by people who have no understanding of how the average small business in Australia operates. They have no idea that the average small businessman is simultaneously the managing director, the sales manager, the personnel manager, the chief accountant and the tea lady all rolled into one. They have this vision that small business operators have a personnel department that can fill out all the forms, answer all the questionnaires and keep all the records of discussions with employees. They do not know the realities of trying to run a small business and the sorts of pressures that bear upon small businessmen. Until they do, they will never solve the unemployment problem of this country. The solution to that problem lies with a resurgent small business sector. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) just spoke to and to which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) moved the motion for the second reading this morning. This legislation continues the process of industrial reform as illustrated by the new Industrial Relations Act, which also has been referred to earlier today and which took effect on 30 March this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the field of waterfront reform, which this legislation is principally concerned with, I think it is fair to say that this government has shown a great deal of courage in its policy moves, despite the occasional outburst to the contrary by those opposite. The process of reform on the waterfront is continuing at a steady pace thanks to the government's commitment to deal with this area in a thoroughly comprehensive and far-sighted manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to repeal redundant provisions dealing with waterfront disputes and the general levy payable by waterfront employers. The bill will also reduce the size of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee and provide for that body to cease to exist when its functions are completed. The majority of the amendments reflect changes in the nature of employment on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most honourable members are no doubt aware, unfortunately it is true that the Australian waterfront has had an unhappy history of inefficient operations compared to the world's best ports. Reform of the waterfront has been proceeding since the Weber task force on shore-based shipping reported in 1986 and found that one of the main causes of inefficiency was low labour and equipment productivity rates. The task force was followed by a comprehensive Inter-State Commission report, which was released in 1989. The ISC recommended a three-year reform package to increase productivity, which centred on changes to the way in which people were employed in the stevedoring industry, reductions in the work force and improvements in management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the signing of an in principle agreement between employers, waterside unions and the ACTU in September 1989, a three-year program was introduced to reform the industry. Prior to the introduction of the reform program, stevedoring had a lot of problems in the industrial area. Employment was industry based. Employers drew on a pool of workers who enjoyed virtually a lifetime guarantee of employment. As a result, there was no direct link between employers and employees, and conditions of employment were standardised across the industry. These arrangements arose out of the history of the waterfront and the unions' successful fight to move away from the pool of casual labour employment arrangements that had characterised the industry for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner of employment changed during the reform program so that stevedoring companies directly employed their work force with the changed aim to increase competition among the stevedoring firms and create a greater affinity between the employer and the employee. As employers could now offer different conditions of employment, there was greater incentive for employers and employees to negotiate changes that could improve productivity and offer rewards to both the company and its employees. The change was implemented through 108 enterprise agreements established by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another central plank of the reform program was the reduction in the size of the stevedoring work force through the provision of attractive retirement-redundancy packages. In the period between the introduction of the reform package on 1 November 1989 and its end on 31 October 1992, the work force was reduced by 4,479 people who took retirement-redundancy packages and 840 by natural attrition. An additional 265 people were recruited into the industry. The net reduction of 5,054 left a work force of 3,818 and represented a reduction in the work force of 57 per cent&mdash;and this is quite substantial&mdash;which was over twice the reduction anticipated in the 1989 in principle agreement. The retirement-redundancy packages cost a total of $413 million, of which the Commonwealth contributed $165 million, the balance being met by levies on employers and their customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform program resulted in considerable change in the stevedoring industry. I will now list some claims of performance improvement. The number of containers handled per person per shift has increased by 130 per cent. Annual savings from the process are estimated to be $300 million. Stevedoring charges have fallen by 20 to 25 per cent between 1990-91 and 1992. The time needed to load and unload a ship with an average container load has fallen from 44 hours in 1989 to 27 hours in June 1992. For grain terminals, costs have fallen by approximately 50 per cent. Ship turnaround time has been reduced by approximately 45 per cent. The number of containers handled per crane hour has increased by 57 per cent. So there have been substantial changes on the waterfront, despite what some people may suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An international comparison of waterfront productivity was conducted by the Bureau of Industry Economics, which released its report in March 1993. The BIE made a number of provisos concerning the comparisons. It noted the difficulties in obtaining identical data from a number of ports and the difference that economies of scale can produce. For example, productivity indicators are measured in terms of a TEU, the equivalent of a standard 20-foot container, which is the type most often used in Australian trade. However, a number of the larger world ports, such as Singapore, deal with a large percentage of 40-foot containers, which are rated as two TEUs. It does not take twice the time to deal with a 40-foot container that it takes for a 20-foot container. The BIE also noted that stevedoring charges are not the sole cost of a port and that port authority charges in Australia are significantly higher than the overseas average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BIE found that average labour productivity in Australian coal terminals is more than 50 per cent higher than the overseas average. Although there was difficulty in gaining valid data for a comparison of labour productivity in relation to container traffic, the available information showed Australian ports to be significantly below the best. The BIE also found that the average crane rate for Australian container terminals was 20.1 TEUs per hour compared with 25 for Singapore and 29 for Yokohama, that labour productivity and equipment utilisation in Australian coal terminals is approaching, or is at, world best practice, and that productivity in container terminals is in some cases approaching world best practice in similar sized overseas ports, but there is considerable scope for further improvement in many Australian container ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some evidence to suggest that the very good rate of reform of the waterfront over the last few years has slowed somewhat recently. A Prices Surveillance Authority report found recently that the reduction in charges to users of the waterfront seems to have levelled off. The report also said that any further gains in waterfront productivity were not likely to match the previous rapid gains. The PSA is also reported as saying that charges may increase as stevedoring companies seek to restore their profits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern that I am sure all members of this House can remember was the recent dispute involving Australian Stevedores and stevedoring unions concerning the plan to retrench 55 more employees. This dispute came about when a merger between various stevedoring companies formed Australian Stevedores last year. One result of that merger was that 317 positions for employees were declared surplus, and the company sought voluntary redundancies to achieve the reduction in the work force. Enterprise agreements were reached between the employer and the employees in eight ports, but agreement was not reached in Sydney, where there was disagreement on four  points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1994 Australian Stevedores announced that it had not announced sufficient voluntary redundancies and that 55 employees would be retrenched. The union's response was a national stoppage of stevedoring workers. This dispute was temporarily resolved when the Industrial Relations Commission ordered the parties to negotiate and the 55 employees to be reinstated. Negotiations to finally settle the matter are continuing, and the company has announced that an additional 37 employees will be dismissed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 of this bill seeks to repeal division 9 of part VI of the act, which establishes port conciliators and coordinating committees. These bodies have become redundant with the introduction of enterprise agreements in the stevedoring industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act 1977 provides for the establishment of a finance committee to administer funds raised through levies on the industry to meet obligations that arose as a result of the previous industry based employment. For example, it administered long service leave contributions that were met from the contributions of all employers as there was no direct link between the employer and the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has largely become irrelevant since the change to enterprise employment but still has functions in respect of funds borrowed to finance the industry contribution to the retirement/redundancy payments made as part of the reform program. The repayment of this amount is financed through a special levy on the industry. Clause 9 of this amendment bill seeks to amend section 5 of this act to reduce the membership of the committee from seven to four and to ensure the continuation of the tenure of the current chairperson of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part III of the act, which provides for the committee to refund funds paid by employers where such obligations would have had to be met by the committee had the employer not met them, and part IV, which requires a register of waterside workers to be kept, will be repealed by clause 12. This clause also provides that if the committee holds funds that it is satisfied relate to an obligation that an employer will have to meet in the future the funds are to be paid to the employer. Proposed section 26A, which will be inserted into this act by clause 20, will require the committee to keep a register of stevedoring employees. The minister has foreshadowed a government amendment to clause 20. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 23 of the amendment legislation will remove the requirement for the committee to lodge an annual report, and clause 24 will insert a sunset clause into this act. Proposed section 32 provides that, if the committee is satisfied that it has discharged its obligations and liabilities, it is to inform the minister of this and is to prepare a scheme for the distribution of any surplus funds it holds and inform the minister of the scheme. If the minister certifies that obligations and liabilities have been met and any surplus funds have been distributed in a manner approved by the minister, and if a copy of such certification is published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, this act will cease to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stevedoring Industry Levy Act must be amended by replacing references to `waterside workers' with references to `stevedoring employees' to reflect the current changes. Clause 27 will repeal section 5 of this act, which sets the rate of the general levy payable in respect of waterside workers. The effect of the amendment is to remove the general levy, which reflects the move to enterprise based employment. Proposed section 13 of this act, which will be inserted by clause 31, provides that this act will cease to have effect if the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee Act ceases to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Stevedoring Industry Levy Collection Act must be amended to insert a definition of `stevedoring employee' to replace the term `waterside worker', as I have already noted in respect of the levy act. The amendment clarifies the groups of employees who are not covered by the levy but also provides that, if a levy were payable in respect of an employee immediately before the commencement of this amendment, the levy will continue to be payable in respect of that employee. The amendment legislation seeks to insert this definition by clause 41, and this means that this act will cease to have effect if the Stevedoring Finance Committee Act ceases to have effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most honourable members would agree that, due to the changed circumstances on the waterfront, these proposed amendments are necessary to continue the process of reform in the stevedoring industry and hopefully to avoid a repeat of the events earlier this year. With regard to the general levy payable by waterfront employers, the amendment legislation will also allow the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee to carry on its role and to carry out its inherited obligations more completely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are a continuation of this government's commitment to labour market reforms as indicated in yesterday's white paper tabled in this place by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I believe this government has an extremely good record in the industrial relations area. It always disappoints me to see the opposition continually oppose anything that this government has put forward in the industrial relations area. It is interesting that earlier the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was comparing Australia with America. He has probably had the opportunity to visit the US. I suggest that a lot of living conditions in the US are nowhere near ours in Australia. We have an obligation to the Australian people. The Prime Minister says we have to bring the people along with us, and he disclosed that in a very compassionate and caring manner. It is something that we on this side of the parliament really feel for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's white paper outlined provisions to help long-term unemployed people and youth unemployed. They are very important issues that we on this side of the parliament have a very strong commitment to. Amendments to acts such as those before us today are part of the ongoing process where things have to be reformed for us to keep moving. We cannot live in the past; we cannot live back in McEwen's days. We have to keep moving along, to move with the modern world and to look at international best practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms on the waterfront that we have been talking about are very important to Australia. I know they take time to achieve but in the end I believe that, by the continuing perseverance by the government and certainly by the current Minister for Industrial Relations in a lot of the reform areas, we will achieve a lot of best practice and that is going to help Australians dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about Australian industry, there is no doubt that the small business sector is a very vital employer in our community, and it certainly does need every assistance it can get. The honourable member for Bennelong mentioned international bankers and the little tricks they get up to but, as I have said before, nothing is worse than when even our own local bankers in Australia do not always pick up the problems that small business have. Small businesses need a lot of help from their bankers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Vaile) agrees with me on this, because he has followed me on this issue once before. It is right. We need to help small business as much as we can. It is not just governments that can do it. It is important that we as a government help small business as much as we can, but it is also important that bankers, who through deregulation have been given wonderful opportunities under this government&mdash;they have been given all the opportunities they wanted but, in my view, have not delivered&mdash;need to be encouraged as often as possible by people in this place to help small business as much as they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to achieve a lot of the goals that were put forward in the white paper released yesterday, we will have to make sure that small business picks up a lot of the initiatives contained in it. It is important for every one of us in this place to study what is in the white paper. We need to encourage those small businesses&mdash;and the larger businesses, as they are probably better placed to assist many of the long-term unemployed&mdash;in our local areas to pick up these initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been cooperation between the government and the ACTU with respect to some of the initiatives in the white paper, and obviously that cooperation will continue. There is a reference in the white paper to in-principle agreements on the training wage. That was reviewed by a high level ACTU negotiating committee, which will recommend to the ACTU executive the adoption of this initiative. Obviously, more discussions will need to take place between the relevant ministers and the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have received this support from the trade union movement to help people in Australia to gain employment after some rather difficult times, which I am sure would be a lot worse if those opposite were in government. When we go through tough times, as Australia and most other countries in the world do, we need to show some compassion to the people who need help the most. The industrial relations process ensures that people are looked after. The worse thing we can do to people when things are tough is to kick them when they are down. Unfortunately, that is the attitude the opposition continues to have to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite had half the chance, they would make people work for nothing. Thank God they have not had half the chance to do that in recent times. The cooperation between this government and the trade union movement has meant that we have been able to maintain reasonable wage levels in those tough times to ensure that members of the Australian work force and their families have been able to maintain some sort of dignity. The changes proposed in the white paper, which involve continuing cooperation between the government and the trade union movement, can only continue to help members of the Australian work force and their families to maintain a decent lifestyle.

Anybody who has an intimate view of what has gone on in the waterfront over the last few years will know that one of the principles of waterfront reform is to establish enterprise employment through enterprise agreements. What does this legislation, which the government hopes will be passed today, do? It goes to the very heart of eroding the benefits of enterprise agreements, enterprise employment. How does it do that? It does it through the establishment of a register of employees of stevedores. That is putting us back in the position we were in prior to 1989 when everybody in the waterfront was employed through a pool&mdash;not through individual enterprises&mdash;and the union had full control over all of those people who worked on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went down to the waterfront during that period and I have been again since. If I had asked a wharfie, `Who do you work for, brother?' he would have said, `The Waterside Workers Federation, of course.' He would not have said that he worked for Conaust, National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, Strang Patrick, as it was then, or whatever other stevedores existed in those days that no longer exist today. But if I went to the waterfront today and asked a wharfie, `Whom do you work for?' he would say, `Conaust' or `Australian Stevedores'. They are the only two left, due to all the government's reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps somebody in the advisers box could remember every word of it. This legislation will take us back to the situation of port pools and the establishment of a register. This is typical of what has happened on the waterfront for a long time throughout Australia's history. We have seen the Australian people pay out $430 million over the period of the waterfront reform process to entice wharfies to retire ahead of schedule through redundancy payments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were 4,500 wharfies who retired. On average $100,000 was given to every retiring wharfie over and above their superannuation, their sick leave and long service leave payments, et cetera. Every cent of that $430 million is being paid for by Australians, either through their taxes or through higher charges on the goods that they consume through the establishment of this levy which will pay for the remaining amounts over and above the taxpayer's contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That amount of money was paid to get the unions to agree to change. As part of the process, those who did not take the redundancy package and kept their jobs as wharfies received average wage increases of 23 per cent. According to the rhetoric of some in this place, the average wharfie is a hard bitten, hard done by soul. But the average wharfie is earning several times more than the average Australian for working probably only 60 per cent as hard as the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in Port Botany and in the home state of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who is at the table, who are working on the waterfront and who have a take home pay of about $92,000 to $94,000 a year. They do not work any harder than anybody else in society, and yet they are earning several times more than most other people in our society. So these people are not hard done by. Those who stayed received a 23 per cent pay rise and those who retired received a $430 million redundancy package which was paid for by everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now we see the process of clawing back all the things that were negotiated during that process which cost this country so much. We are seeing through this legislation the power of the wharfies that was taken away during the period of waterfront reform slowly re-established. This is what this register is all about. We are masking the reason why we need a register by saying, `We must have this register because we have to conform with ILO convention 137'&mdash;I think that is right. Who is the ILO? It is the International Labour Organisation. Why should we take any notice of the International Labour Organisation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, when the Country Women of the World has an international conference and carries resolutions, why do we not kowtow to those? Why do we not stand here in this House and say, `The Country Women of the World have made a recommendation that we do these various things; therefore, we will.' It is nonsense. The ILO's conventions have no more weight in this place than a convention of Country Women of the World has. We should not be kowtowing to the ILO or any other organisation, other than those based here in Australia, to govern our own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is masking its attempt to re-establish the power of the trade union movement on the waterfront through the need to keep in step with ILO convention 137. It does not fool most people, but unfortunately it seems to have fooled people on the government side, which of course is a fairly common event these days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole purpose of what we have achieved on the waterfront is to try to make Australia's waterfront more internationally competitive. I heard the honourable member for Oxley and I no doubt will hear from the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) about how we have gone so far towards achieving this. Even though we have spent all this money, $430 million, and provided wharfies with a 23 per cent pay rise, and treated them like royalty, productivity levels on the Australian waterfront have declined over recent time. During the waterfront reform process, there is no doubt that crane loading rates improved by up to 50 per cent&mdash;no doubt about that at all. But it is interesting to note that in the latter portion of last year crane loading rates for TEUs per hour at Sydney went from 19.95 down to 13.8. The same thing occurred in Melbourne where they went from 26.75 TEUs per hour down to 18.8 TEUs per hour. What we see there is effectively a reduction in crane loading rates at two of our major ports, Sydney and Melbourne, of around 50 per cent. What does that mean? The wharfies got the $430 million and the 23 per cent increase in pay rates, and the productivity gains that were achieved in the process of forking out all of that have now been eroded. As a result, Australia really has not got that far down the track towards being internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note some TEU rates or crane loading rates for containers in other countries. If we look at Felixstowe for the same period as I just compared Sydney and Melbourne to, it had crane loading rates of 35.36 TEUs per hour. Auckland, New Zealand, had TEU crane loading rates of 30 per hour, compared with Sydney which had 13.8 and Melbourne which had 18.8. So we have not achieved one of the goals set through waterfront reform of making ourselves internationally competitive. It is fair enough to say that loading a container in Sydney is 2 1/2 times more expensive than loading exactly the same container in New Zealand. That is the sort of competition we are up against and that is the sort of failure that we have had despite the fact that we have forked out all of that money, provided the wharfies that remain with a substantial increase in their pay rates and given them, I think, a pretty fair deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, by masquerading it as a requirement to meet ILO convention 137, is doing this country a great disservice because there is no doubt at all that the net result of this will be, as the legislation says, the re-establishment of a register of waterside employees. What do we need a register for? We have enterprise employment now. We need the register so that the union knows who is on the waterfront, whom they are working for, for how much, for how long and all those sorts of things. It is a process of re-establishing what was there before 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the stevedore employers are doing what they are required to do by law, then they already keep a list of their own employees, which is privy to them but which can be provided to people from the industrial relations department, the tax man or whoever else requires it. So we do not need an additional list set up through this legislation. Indeed, why do we need the list? The list is simply there for the benefit of the Maritime Union of Australia. It wants to reintroduce a list because it wants to re-establish the job for life syndrome on the waterfront. That has been a fact of life on the waterfront for quite a long time now, but the threat has been that through the waterfront reform process that was going to be traded off. We saw in February of this year Australian stevedores go through a very costly and painful strike. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a payback. It is a payback by this government for the support that it got from the trade union movement during the last election. I note the minister has said that he is prepared to move an amendment which says that, if the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee feels it necessary, then it may reintroduce the register. If it feels the register is not necessary, it may not. Now that seems like quite a compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first blush it probably is. But when we go to the structure of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee that the minister is proposing it is quite possible that the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee will be completely dominated by wharfies, members of the Maritime Union of Australia. From memory, the chairman of it is appointed by the minister and there are two other people on it&mdash;an appointee of the Maritime Union of Australia and an employer of stevedores. People will say that is all right, that means there is one from the unions and one from the employers. But that does not necessarily follow. If, for example, a representative of the Federated Stevedores in Darwin happens to be appointed to the committee we end up with a member of the trade union, the Maritime Union of Australia, because Federated Stevedores is indeed a stevedoring business which is owned by the local branch of what was the Waterside Workers Federation in Darwin. So it is quite possible if we go down that route to end up with a committee fully dominated by members of the Maritime Union of Australia, the wharfies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making this compromise through this amendment that the minister has indicated that he will put forward, we could still end up, and indeed I would suggest we will most likely end up, with the reintroduction of a register. If we have the reintroduction of a register, it will take away all of the benefits that we have achieved on the Australian waterfront. It causes me a great deal of alarm and distress to see this legislation being put forward. I know it causes stevedore employers around Australia the same sort of distress. They are totally opposed, to a man, to this legislation because from their point of view there is no need for it; and from their point of view it leads to the reintroduction of the old habits and the old ways that this country fought so long against and paid a very high price to get rid of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose that this bill be opposed. The coalition will not support it because we do not want to see the re-establishment of a register. Indeed, I am sure most Australians would approve of that view. We also oppose it because we do not like the way the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is being set up. We do not like it because we think, as do those who have been involved with the waterfront for quite some time now, that there is no purpose in the future for the existence of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. The whole process of waterfront reform was going to end with the axing of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee because there was going to be no need for its existence. The sole purpose of the existence of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee is to collect a levy to pay for the redundancies that have been forked out to retiring wharfies over the last few years. Once those redundancies have been paid for, there is no further purpose for the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee; therefore, its future is limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation gives the future of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee a great deal more life. It means that it will not close down and it will continue on for goodness knows how long. That is, once again, against the principle of waterfront reform which was undertaken over the period from 1989 to 1992. Indeed, it goes against correspondence that this Minister for Industrial Relations sent to the employers of waterfront labour when he gave a commitment that in the future there would be an axing of the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee. Senator Collins, the former minister, indicated the same thing and, indeed, the current Minister for Industrial Relations, I think it was, gave a commitment that there would not be the reintroduction of a register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these things go against the reform process and against commitments made by the current minister and the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins. It is for those reasons that we have a concern about it and it is for those reasons that we will oppose the amendments. It is the rightful duty of this opposition to stand up for what it believes to be right and to stand up to people who have, over a long period, done enormous harm to Australia's export earning capacity, done enormous harm to the job creation potential of businesses right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trade union on the waterfront, now the Maritime Union of Australia, has really had the best of all worlds. Its members have had that $430 million and their 23 per cent pay rise. They have taken back the productivity gains they gave and now want to reinstate the job for life and full control of everybody who works on the waterfront. These people can only be described as selfish and greedy. We have seen through the 1980s some very selfish and greedy entrepreneurs make a poultice for themselves at the expense of others in this country. Those people are rightly vilified around this country for the greed they displayed and the costs they imposed on other people. If it is right to vilify those people, then it is right to vilify the Maritime Union of Australia which has taken so much from this country and given so little and now wants more than everybody else is entitled to and it is entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose this bill. Indeed, I hope that through the processes in the Senate we will see this bill knocked out. I hope that we will see commonsense and decency prevail and the commitments that this government gave to the employers of waterfront labour, from 1989 right up to the last few months, fulfilled, as they were promised by various government ministers during that period. </PARA>

To listen to the crowd opposite&mdash;we heard the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), say some time ago that he would put troops on the waterfront&mdash;one would think that, if they took the wharfies out of the waterfront, lined them up against the wall and shot them, all would be peace, sweetness, light and understanding on the waterfront. If we are to start throwing blame around about what is happening on the waterfront, we should take a look at a few of the actors, the people, on the waterfront. The members of that committee spent over a year going around the various waterfronts in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too easy to blame the waterside workers for every ill on the Australian waterfront. It is only disguising some of the omissions of the people whom the opposition purports to represent.

Take loading: sending all the cargo at the very last minute instead of having it spaced conveniently over time. Take the mishmash of working hours. Take the tardy attitude of many people towards the use of electronic transfers. Take the whole stream, the whole host, of documentation: thousands and thousands of documents.

This followed the signing of an in-principle agreement by employees, waterside unions and the ACTU in September 1989 and a three-year program was introduced to reform and restructure this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the reform program began, stevedoring employment was industry based. Employers drew from a pool of workers. The result was no direct link between the employer and the employee and the conditions of employment were standardised across the industry. Before the opposition starts making its usual rumblings, I point out that this arrangement reflected the history of the waterfront, an arrangement supported by coalition governments of many years standing. I listened to what the honourable member for Hume was saying and say that the opposition has supported the employment practices on the waterfront over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manner of employment changed under the reform program so that stevedoring companies directly employed their work force. The change had a goal of competition amongst stevedoring firms and a stronger link between the parties in the employment relationship. Stevedoring employers could now offer different conditions of employment and the incentive to negotiate changes which could improve productivity and offer both the companies and workers rewards. The change was implemented through 108 enterprise agreements. The agreements were approved and watched over by WIRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform process reduced the size of the waterfront work force. This was achieved by retirement and redundancy packages. I know that the amount that was paid galls honourable members opposite; nevertheless, these were negotiated between November 1989 and October 1992. The waterfront work force was reduced by over 4,000 people who took advantage of the retirement and redundancy packages but, because of the age process, there was also a recruitment to the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said, this legislation will reflect changes in the nature of employment on the waterfront. I am disappointed that the opposition has decided to oppose the legislation, but I am not surprised. As I said, sooner or later members of the opposition are going to realise that there are more than waterside workers on the waterfront; there is a whole range of players in that very important sector of the Australian industry; so they should stop bashing the waterside workers and have a look at some of the people they purport to support. If there are inefficiencies on the waterfront, for once they should do a bit of homework and trace the blame to where those inefficiencies really lie. They will find that, in most cases, it is not the waterside workers of Australia whose union has been massively reformed and restructured; it is many of those people that they stand up in this parliament and purport to support. I reject the opposition's amendment and support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we debate matters industrial, it is not unusual, I have found, for speakers on the government side of the House who follow to make reference to my remarks. In fact, it would be unusual if they did not. However, this is the first occasion on which I have risen to speak on an industrial relations bill before this House when the previous speaker, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), has already told the House what I am going to say. It was indeed most interesting to hear the honourable member for Throsby wax lyrical about how I am going to attack his precious waterside workers and their obviously excellent personal qualities. The honourable member may like to wait and see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate, I think, that this bill is before the House at this time, following as it does fairly immediately the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) yesterday afternoon on unemployment. The Prime Minister's statement was primarily about unemployment, not about employment. This Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill is also about unemployment; it is not about employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one more in a long series of bills brought into this place to fix up major legislation. We have had so many bills to add on to the poor Industrial Relations Legislation Act 1988 that the act hardly any longer represents what it was in 1988. In fact, it is very difficult for those who have to work in the bureaucracy with the way our employment bills operate in this country and with our legislation that determines the relationships between employers and employees. It is an indictment that the rules and regulations are so complex and occupy so many pages. Not only is a legal degree needed order to interpret them properly but probably also a whole host of clerks is needed to make sure that the proper procedures are followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The waterfront in Australia has a long, colourful history. I am not, despite the words of the honourable member for Throsby, going to deal at length with the old inefficiencies and enmities that have existed on the waterfront not only in this country but in other countries around the world for almost 100 years. That history is colourful and it is interesting. But I am not sure how relevant it is to the debate today except that this bill gives the government, and gives the industry itself, the opportunity to go back to the employment practices of the past, which were inappropriate, which were inefficient, which were costly and which placed a burden on all Australians in terms of the cost that they had to pay for imported goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform process, which other speakers have referred to, has been a long, slow process. Lasting several years and costing Australian industry and Australian taxpayers some $420 million, it was a process which had to be undertaken, but the mechanisms by which this government chose to undertake that process left a great deal to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we have achieved some efficiencies in the waterfront with the so-called reform process. The fact is that there are fewer people now employed on the waterfront. The fact is that there are now two major companies in the five major ports which compete directly with each other. The fact is that we now have supposed enterprise agreements between the union and the employers. Those enterprise agreements designate the working conditions of the people who work in the industry at the ports and designate their pay rates and the totality of their terms and conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But those employees today are employed directly by companies. Before this process began, before the restructuring, we had for a very long time pooled employment. In fact, it was back in 1967 that we introduced permanent employment for registered waterside workers. Prior to 1967 all waterfront employment had been on a casual basis. Individuals were selected from a pool and put into their jobs on a particular day by the employers, but the pool itself was maintained and directed by the union. So if a person wanted a job on the waterfront then that person went not to an employer seeking to ask the employer to give him a job; he went to the union. He went to the union boss and did what was necessary to get the union boss to give him a job. That job meant that the person had the right to be registered and the right to stay in the casual pool, which meant that maybe he got work and maybe he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The port pools were also at that time established for excess workers. They were for those who could not be used on the day, and those individuals either sat and waited for eventual employment or were told to go home and were still paid. The payment for that came via an industry levy which was administered by a separate organisation. In 1977 that organisation was abolished in five major ports and pool employees were allocated to employers. New levies were established at that time in order to pay for the pool employees whose labour could not be utilised on the day or on the shift. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in fact a jobs for life industry. If one wanted a job on the waterfront, one approached the union and one could be guaranteed employment forever. That was not unusual around the world, nor is it necessarily unusual in other industries in other countries. It had not been generally the practice in Australia that we had jobs for life, as it was not in the country which I came from many years ago, but there are countries in Europe where jobs for life have been part of the industrial scene for a very long time. Again, it is not part of the Australian experience. One of the problems with jobs for life is the fact that there is no real incentive to do better and to progress, to work harder or faster, because, no matter what one does or does not do today, one still is paid and one still has the job tomorrow. A job where performance is taken into account and one is paid appropriately tends to generate greater efficiencies for any organisation and for an economy than does a jobs for life type of scenario. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following 1977, when the new levies were established and the pool employees were allocated to employers, we maintained that scenario until the most recent reform process. Now we have employees employed by the employers and no pool, because in effect the $420 million has been used to pay employees who have left the industry for their redundancy and has been used to help recompense others for disadvantage which they have suffered through the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, firstly, recognises the role of enterprise agreements by repeal of division 9 of part 6 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, which established port conciliators and coordinating committees. This bill finally recognises what has become fact, and that is enterprise agreements. We all know that enterprise agreements were not on the agenda of the Labor Party, were not part of any ALP platform. Enterprise agreements are finally seeing the light of day in our country because of the continued pressure put on government by my side of politics, by the opposition, to try to free up the labour market and to try to make more meaningful the employment contract between an employee and his employer rather than between some obscure body and the employer or, in the case of the waterfront, a pool of employees who owed their pool existence to the union bosses themselves. That part of the bill which recognises enterprise agreements is a positive part of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill then goes on and amends section 5, to reduce the size of the finance committee and to remove the general levy, but to allow special levies to be struck by the committee and to reintroduce an industry register of employees. It is these two issues with which the opposition takes exception today. The committee itself should have the right to determine its own members and the committee should certainly represent the interests and rights of the employers, who are those who provide the employment on the waterfront, as in fact they do in any other enterprise or any other industry. So we object to this reduction in the size of the committee and the inability of the industry to establish its members of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We vociferously object to the reintroduction of the industry register of employees. Pooling has been a fact of life on the waterfront for a very long time. But in fact the waterfront reform authority, the bills, the acts, and the $420 million that Australians have spent to change practice on the waterfront and to pay out excess people from their jobs for life, were to get rid of the concept of pooling and of the concept that employees were employed by someone who did not utilise their labour; notwithstanding that they were not paid by that organisation and that they were in fact paid by employers who paid levies in order to be sure that employees were paid whether they worked or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any attempt to return to the pooling arrangements will break down the enterprise employment agreements which are in place and will break down the whole shift in emphasis that the government tells us it is so determined to push ahead with, and that is to re-establish relationships between those who do the work and those who pay for the work. Those relationships will become very important, both in a productivity sense and in a personal sense, so that those in work are able to feel that they contribute to a company's wellbeing&mdash;and to their own employment, if you will&mdash;by helping to make a company strong and competitive and by helping it to produce the products and services that that company was formed to produce and supply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the concept of jobs for life, which is inherent in pooling, must not return to the Australian waterfront; but this bill allows it to return. And the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) tells us he must do this because he is required to by International Labour Organisation convention No. 137, which Australia ratified in 1974. The date 1974 is particularly important, because I note that the requirement for all countries under conventions of the United Nations is that these ILO conventions may be dispensed with only once every 10 years, on the anniversary of signing and ratifying the particular convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I maintain that the need for Australia to ratify, to be part of, and to agree to, convention No. 137 has long passed. There are 20 other countries who signed that convention and are still on that register. The other subscribers are Afghanistan, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Finland, Greece, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Kenya, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Tanzania and Uruguay. </PARA>

So the minister says that now we must have a register, because ILO Convention No. 137 says we must have a register. Why did we ratify convention No. 137? Amongst other things, the preamble to the convention says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering that such changes, by speeding up freight movements, reducing the time spent by ships in ports and lowering transport costs, may benefit the economy of the country concerned as a whole and contribute to the raising of the standard of living, and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is because of roll-on, roll-off techniques with the introduction of containers to international shipping&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering that dock workers&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>wait for it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should share in the benefit secured by the introduction of new methods of cargo handling and that, accordingly, action for the lasting improvement of their situation, by such means as regularisation of employment and stabilisation of income, and other measures relating to their conditions of work and life, as well as to safety and health aspects of dock work, should be planned and taken concurrently with the planning and introduction of new methods&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on and on. Evidently, those are the reasons why Australia deemed that we should sign this convention. The convention was brought forward by the International Labour Organisation to make sure that the waterside workers, the dock workers of Australia, were compensated for these new techniques, and that resulted in our pooling. That resulted in the lists and that resulted in all of those practices we have heard about in this place time and time again which acted to the detriment of the Australian economy and were rorts&mdash;well and truly some of the greatest rorts that have ever been perpetrated on Australian business and Australian commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the waterfront reform process took place, we transferred any obligation towards those pooled employees, firstly, by redundancy payments which were exceedingly overgenerous and which were accepted voluntarily by those in the jobs. They were not imposed; they were put there voluntarily. As for the removal of some of the other rorts and practices, compensation of the remaining employees took place by way of very generous increases in hourly rates and further improvements in conditions of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have long since taken care of any responsibility we had under ILO convention 137, ratified in 1974, which we should withdraw from in 1994. I make this recommendation to the Minister for Industrial Relations with great joy. The minister would only want to bring back the register to allow the union to re-create a pool so that the committee could reintroduce levies. That would take us back to the old practices, and the benefits that we have obtained in improvements in productivity and performance would be lost. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes before other matters commence, I will start my contribution. I have been listening to the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) and the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). As the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said, they have forgotten nothing and they have learnt nothing. What we hear from them are the same old attitudes, the same old catchcries, the same old slogans of attack. All the problems on the waterfront are problems for people who work on the waterfront. In the ideal world, I suppose the honourable member for La Trobe would probably abolish people altogether on the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were no people on the waterfront, most of the problems would still remain. The honourable member for La Trobe carried on about ILO convention 137. The legislation provides for the register to be maintained. If the honourable member looks closely at the legislation, he will find that the amendment that will be moved later in this debate does not bear any relationship to the re-establishment of the old financial arrangements or wage arrangements between the work force and employers. As I have said, each time these issues or the waterfront comes up, the same slogans are regurgitated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back further: this legislation addresses legislation created by his colleagues in the conservative party. It is legislation of the conservative party; it has never been legislation of the Labor Party. I refer the House to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 20 October 1977, page 2246. This is where it all began. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is part of a parcel of legislation designed to enable the introduction of new administrative, financial and industrial arrangements for the stevedoring industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The then Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street, foreshadowed it. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bills that I am now introducing give precise expression to the decisions of principle which I indicated the government would translate into legislation during this session of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the opposition's legislation. He was going to reform the waterfront. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be recalled that up until 1967 the nature of waterside employment was almost exclusively casual. This resulted in a situation whereby the absence of employer-employee relationships which existed in most other industries adversely affected the performance of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The waterfront we had up until the waterfront reform of this government was the creation of the conservative governments&mdash;of the Fraser government's Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Street. I will not go through all the text. Members can read it. I will just pluck out some bits to drive the point home. On the following page, page 2247, he referred to the problem of surplus labour on the waterfront. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first step was to act in respect of the problem of surplus labour.</PARA>
<PARA>I mention this because the previous speakers on the other side made great play of the fact that there have been redundancy payments. Redundancy payments on the waterfront were not the creation of this government or Labor governments. They were the creation of conservative Fraser governments. Mr Street went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arising from those proceedings, a special redundancy program was developed which was to apply for a limited period . . . This program had the immediate effect of some 900 men being induced to leave their employment.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point that was made by the previous speaker. People voluntarily accepted redundancy packages. According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, the voluntary packages were advanced by the Fraser government. Mr Street continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I might point out that since 1975 the work force has been reduced by almost 3,000. The total industry work force has declined since 1966 from 21,000 men to a position where today there are slightly more than 10,000 waterside workers. The cost of removing men from the industry has not been light. There was, however, an acceptance by those in the industry that the level of the labour force had to be reduced and I would point out that this reduction was achieved without disruption of any kind.</PARA>
<PARA>What has come from those on the other side today shows that they have no knowledge of the origin of the legislation, of the arrangements on the waterfront. Those arrangements were the creation of conservative governments. The Fraser government in 1977 offered the redundancy packages to buy people&mdash;surplus work force&mdash;out of the waterfront. It is there in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, as I have mentioned, on page 2247. Instead of coming here today to try to make an effective contribution to this debate, as one would expect from them, those opposite have again launched an assault on the people who work on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we have the performance from the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). The honourable member for Hume has a habit of making a statement&mdash;how inaccurate it is does not seem to matter to him&mdash;then, having made that statement, repeating it whenever the opportunity comes. The statement he made this morning about the fall-off in crane handling rates in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne I can read to you also from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on page 1993 of 23 March 1994&mdash;less than two months ago. The reference he made there to crane rates falling off in the port of Sydney from 19 TEUs&mdash;20-foot equivalent units&mdash;per hour to 14 per hour and dropping from 27 TEUs per hour to 19 TEUs per hour in the port of Melbourne is exactly the one he repeated today. That information appears to have been drawn from an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 17 February which quoted from advice provided by a firm called Contships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other operators in the industry and other users of the industry took exception to that report and to the contents of it, but the factual information that destroys what the honourable member for Hume had to say earlier, that exposes the hypocrisy of it, is from the Department of Transport, which shows that the national weighted average crane handling rates for the container terminals in the September and December quarters of 1993, which is the period he referred to, in Sydney were 20.2 TEUs per hour; in Melbourne, 20.6. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Melbourne there was a slight reduction. That related to various industrial issues that arose and terminal development work at the Commonwealth facility. Time does not permit me to pursue my point. I will resume it, I hope, on Monday.

I suspect that it will be enormously difficult to get answers to those questions. The first question is: who was the Mr X? If it was not Senator Richardson, please tell us who it was. Who was the Mr X, the senior ALP figure? The second question to be answered is: who were the underworld figures in Sydney and on the Gold Coast who were paying for these prostitutes? Who were those people? The third question to be answered is: what compensation was there? What was the quid pro quo?

How would an investigation of a senior ALP figure in Australia not have been brought to the attention of the relevant minister? I think that the minister is now in a very serious situation. To say that he did not know that is an admission of total towering incompetence and of being treated in total contempt by the officers in his department&mdash;or he knew and was using some tricky nuances and legal devices to slip the noose on saying anything yesterday in this House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the public opinion of Australia's politicians deteriorating, it is now time to initiate some change to the system and to make citizens feel as if they are part of the decision making process. I daresay that I am not alone among honourable members in the chamber in having many constituents contacting me to express their concern over the way that government at all levels of this country currently operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, according to an article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, there was a survey on multicultural affairs that showed that only three in 10 voters thought the government could be trusted and only one in five considered that it knew what it is doing. People were asked to comment on whether they think leaders and other politicians are untrustworthy or insincere. The survey says something about Australians' approach to politics and to the political world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, today I wish to place on record my very strong support for the principle of citizens initiated referenda. It is a principle of having a process where the public can initiate and then make or repeal a law by referenda. No-one of any political view could deny that such an approach would be democratic. There is a need to cut the disillusionment the public has with the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public opinion, of course, is understandably disillusioned with government and politicians. All of us looked at the policies announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) prior to the last election and at what he promised. However, he tricked the Australian people because no sooner had the election taken place than the government marched into this place to announce that it was unable to fulfil its election promises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia were disillusioned yet again by politicians saying one thing prior to an election and then saying another immediately after. Of course, that is a tragedy. It reflects very badly not only on the Prime Minister but on all politicians in Australia. Through CIR, citizens initiated referenda, Australian people would have the opportunity to participate in the process of law-making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many arguments in favour and some arguments against this initiative which had been adopted in many other parts of the world.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note is that citizens would feel that they are having a very real and meaningful input into the decision making process that affects their lives and that they are not simply being subjected to rules and regulations enforced from above. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a situation in the ACT where the Liberal opposition has put forward a policy for CIR&mdash;or DD, direct democracy, as it is also known. I understand that it is very likely that the Legislative Assembly in the ACT, with the support of the Independents, could well carry this proposal, and it could be that the ACT becomes the laboratory in Australia for citizens initiated referenda. As such, this would be a catalyst for the introduction of this initiative elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now is the time that we in the federal parliament should consider following the example likely to be enacted shortly in the ACT assembly. It ought to be noted that the CIR is not the property of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the ALP, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, until the 1960s had CIR as part of its platform. The Australian Democrats have supported it; the National Party government in Queensland prior to the election in 1989 looked at it. The Liberal Party in Queensland went to the people at the last state election supporting the principle of citizens initiated referenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At federal level the coalition has been investigating this concept for a number of years, and honourable members would be aware of the green paper released by the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in 1988 when he was then shadow Attorney-General. The coalition has not as yet adopted the principle of CIR but I certainly hope that it is going to be on our agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, one ought to look at some of the principles contained in the paper by the honourable member for Flinders. It is important that a very substantial proportion of the electorate indicates that it supports the initiative to be put to the people. About five per cent of the Australian electorate would be an appropriate percentage and I understand that would amount to approximately 500,000 signatures. If we use the precedent of the American situation, this should indicate that frivolous proposals are not put up. Frivolous proposals would waste the time of the community and indeed cost great amounts of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to realise that referenda ought to be held only on the days of state, federal or local elections. The last thing we would want would be for referenda to be held regularly every three months. The cost would be horrendous and, indeed, we could well have a situation where the system, which I believe is very worthwhile, could be brought into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the federal situation, it would be wise to ensure that not only was there the necessary majority of electors in the Commonwealth to carry the initiative but also that there was a majority of people in the majority of states. Of course, that goes very much to accountability. It would also go very much to recognition of the fact that any referendum carried by the Australian people should have a broad consensus right across the Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Opponents of CIR have pointed to a number of potential drawbacks. Some people say that there is a difficulty in identifying and verifying signatures: 500,000 signatures represent a lot of people. That could be approached through a sampling process and I think that it would be very unlikely that any group would look at bringing 500,000 signatures forward, if those signatures had been forged or rorted. A verifying process by sampling could ensure that the signatures were indeed genuine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost is another matter which is regularly raised by those who fear the wrath of the people. As I said, if we ensure that the referenda are held only at the time that elections are held, we would certainly get around the problem. Those people who hold others in monumental contempt would suggest that the general public does not have any ability to draft laws. Looking at some of the shocking bills and amendments that the government has brought in, and remembering the discussions we have had over and over again on certain bills, I would have to say that the public certainly would not have a monopoly on bad drafting. Facilities could be made available to people to ensure that bills were of a very high standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are solutions for all of the problems raised by opponents of direct democracy. We do have a good system currently. We have a constitution that has worked and that has ensured that, as a nation, we enjoy freedoms that are the envy of the world. I include the constitutional monarchy as being one of those institutions that really have helped us as Australians to be envied by people throughout the world. But we could make our system better and I would therefore look at CIR as being a supplement to a system that works well. It is working in 26 states in the United States. It has existed in Switzerland since 1874 and it exists today in various forms in several European countries and I understand that, in Canada, it is widely used at local government level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that, as elected representatives of the people, we do whatever we can to restore the regard that people have for the political process. We have a situation where, if we continue on the road that we are on and people are disillusioned, we could well have social breakdown. I think that is really quite tragic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that there has been a suggestion that the government is going to seek to overrule the laws in Tasmania in relation to homosexuality. If CIR existed in Tasmania, the way to resolve any problem would be for those people who feel that the Tasmanian parliament does not represent the will of the Tasmanian people to bring forward a referendum that could be dealt with at the time of the next election. The will of the people of Tasmania would determine whether the government of Tasmania is in or out of step with the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must do whatever we can to gather input from the community. We, of course, do not have a monopoly on wisdom and commonsense. Indeed, many of the bills that have been carried through this place have in fact been quite ridiculous and have helped to bring Australia as a nation and the parliament as an institution into disrepute. I think that there is no valid criticism of citizen initiated referenda or direct democracy which cannot be addressed. What we have to do, as parliamentarians of all parties, is to sit down and try to work out how to take this very important initiative and make this very important improvement to our Australian system work for the benefit of the Australian people&mdash;the people we are supposed to represent. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I would like to recognise a great moment in world history. In particular, I refer to the incredible achievements, against all odds, in recent days of a great man. Of course, I refer to Nelson Mandela, the president-elect of the Republic of South Africa. Nelson Mandela will be elected president of South Africa; it is only a matter of time before that is declared. It is worth considering the events that have taken place over the last few days and the events leading up to that great moment in world history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1910 the black people of South Africa were excluded from their country's parliamentary process, so for 84 years we have had an abhorrent, repressive system of apartheid&mdash;racial discrimination&mdash;whereby all except an exclusive white minority were denied basic human rights, including the right to vote, of all things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is significant also to point out the contribution made by the party which I am very proud to be a member of, the Australian Labor Party, in the process that we have seen in South Africa. Last year the national executive of the Labor Party decided that the party would assist the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela's party, in its election campaign. That was a very good decision, I believe, especially given the fact that the majority of South Africans would never have voted before or ever had any experience of elections. Certainly the ANC had never been allowed to take part in an election before. So I think it was very important for like-minded political parties and political movements like the Australian Labor Party to assist in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to read out a letter to the parliament, a letter that I was very proud to receive as a member of the Australian Labor Party. It was a letter dated 24 April 1994. It was sent to every member of the Australian Labor Party. My letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Chris,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you as a member of the Australian Labor Party to say thank you for the assistance the Labor Party has provided to the ANC. This week 18 million South Africans will vote for the very first time in an election that is not merely a contest between different political organisations but a contest about freedom. Since its inception the ANC has been committed to the creation of a non-racial democratic South Africa&mdash;a South Africa that will protect the rights of the individual while building a nation in which all are equal and secure. It is a commitment I know is shared by the Australian Labor Party. But the ban on the African National Congress was lifted a mere three years ago and, unlike you, we have never fought an election. It has meant we have had to instantly acquire skills that under normal conditions would have taken decades. That is why I want to take this opportunity to express my profound appreciation of the support our struggle has received from the Australian Labor Party and therefore from you&mdash;support not just in international forums but support for ANC endorsed activities through your federal government's aid program, and more recently your party's very direct assistance in providing campaign organisers. The campaign expertise that Ian Henderson, the assistant national secretary of the Australian Labor Party, is currently providing our campaign follows a long tradition of support from Labor's parliamentary leadership, support from leaders like Gough Whitlam, Bob Hawke and more recently Prime Minister Paul Keating. It is therefore reassuring to know that in these final days I can continue to rely on the support of the Australian Labor Party, and for this I thank you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours in the struggle,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nelson R. Mandela</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ANC candidate for the president of South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, I was extremely proud, along with most members of the Australian Labor Party in Australia to receive that letter from Nelson Mandela. It very rightly points out the support that the ALP gave. The ALP is, after all, a like-minded party having the same beliefs in equality and democracy and social justice as the ANC. It is quite right that our party is recognised for its support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also fair to mention that there are others who have contributed. One should mention the contribution made by the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, for his role as an eminent person in the CHOGM process. Of course, at that stage most of the British Commonwealth countries were on board in the fight against apartheid and repression in South Africa, all except one, the British government led by that arch right wing reactionary, Margaret Thatcher. It was still holding out in support of apartheid. But every other country in the Commonwealth knew how abhorrent the apartheid system was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice my colleagues in the opposition are still trying to argue the point about this. I would have thought they would be past that by now. Nevertheless, one needs to give credit where credit is due. I believe that Malcolm Fraser, along with the other former Labor Prime Ministers I have mentioned, deserves credit for his ongoing role in the fight against apartheid and the fight for freedom, equality and democracy in South Africa. Of course he, along with Bob Hawke, has been over in South Africa recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose my first memory of South Africa was as a country in an atlas I would have had at school where all the British Commonwealth countries were painted pink. At that stage South Africa was a member of the British Commonwealth. It pulled out of the Commonwealth in the early 1960s after being condemned for its apartheid policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other early memory of South Africa is due to my lifetime interest in cricket, and to a lesser extent rugby. I can remember Australia playing cricket against South Africa and the South African cricketers being a pretty formidable bunch. There were the Pollock brothers and Eddie Barlow and those people. I certainly remember South Africa as a cricketing nation long before I was old enough to understand dreadful things like apartheid and the political repression that went on in that country. That led to our no longer playing cricket against South Africa after 1969-70 and no longer playing rugby against them after 1971, after that dreadful tour by the Springboks in 1971. They are my early memories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me once again reflect on the achievements of Nelson Mandela. He is a person who has spent almost 50 years leading the struggle, leading the group called the African National Congress which now can be called a political party in the democratic process. He led that fight against overwhelming odds in a situation where the very existence of his organisation was banned. As I said, against overwhelming odds he has continued to lead that struggle and to be in the position today of being elected president, the first ever democratically elected president of the Republic of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, this is a guy who spent 27 years in gaol. Can you imagine how you would be if you had spent 27 years in gaol. Here is a man who not only survived that and kept his sanity and kept his faculties and continued to struggle, but he has come out of 27 years in prison to continue to lead his party. The culmination of that is his election as President of the Republic of South Africa. It is truly an amazing feat and truly one which must inspire awe amongst anyone who likes to think about it. The struggle that that man has gone through, together with many of his supporters, is monumental. After 27 years in gaol still to have all his faculties, his sanity, and more importantly his resolve strengthened, is an absolutely incredible achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose I have one reservation about the process that has happened in South Africa. Once again I hark back to cricket. If a whites-only South African team can give us a hiding in the 1960s and give us a run for our money in the recent series, imagine what a South African cricket team chosen from the whole population could do. When it happens, when the first ever fully representative South African cricket team is selected, imagine what it will do to the Australian team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seriously though, I think that the resumption of sporting contact with South Africa has been a very positive thing. It has assisted this democratic process. But the resumption of cricket and rugby and other sporting ties, as well as the removal of trade sanctions against South Africa, would not have happened without the endorsement of Nelson Mandela. And that needs to be stressed as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I think it is a wonderful result for South Africa and a wonderful result for equality and democracy worldwide. I can only ask people to consider the enormous achievements that have been made in the last few days, being the culmination of the achievements of the last few years in South Africa. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>Less than two weeks ago Australia paid homage to the men and women who died on foreign shores for the sake of maintaining the Australian way of life. While we remember those who died, it seems that the federal government would rather forget those remaining. Despite the assurances of the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), I grieve today for the veterans that returned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the past 10 years Australia has been addressing the discrepancies which have occurred in the recognition of the returned service personnel. Recently, however, the federal government has turned around and is once again making the veterans suffer during their time of need. The role of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, as its name suggests, is to look after the interests of all veterans. This would suggest that it should be working with the Returned Services League to establish the most effective means of resolving veteran issues and concerns. The RSL is recognised as the main avenue of support for veterans. The league, however, is continually being kept out of important decisions which affect the lives of thousands of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been brought to my attention that in at least two major issues recently faced by veterans in Western Australia the government has ignored the wishes of veterans. This has left the veterans confused and often scared&mdash;scared at how the government is treating those who assumed they would be looked after by the country which they fought for. Firstly, there is the selling of Hollywood hospital. This is one of the many veteran hospitals which was sacrificed in the federal government's rationalisation process. Prior to the calling for tenders in the beginning of 1993, each state government was approached and offered control of the hospitals. The Western Australian government declined this offer. Since then the Hollywood hospital has been privately purchased by Ramsays, and, while part of the condition of the sale was that veterans would still have access to the hospital and its facilities, the men and women who have risked their lives for this country have put up with a changeover which is less than satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has coincided with the introduction of a scheme which invites veterans to use public hospitals as private patients. While many of the veterans would prefer to continue using the hospital which they have attended for many years, they are being `encouraged' to go elsewhere. This includes being informed that the treatment that they require is only available at a hospital other than Hollywood. This treatment has been available in the past at Hollywood hospital. Since part of the conditions of sale was the maintaining of the ability for veterans to use the facilities, surely the new owners of the hospital would have kept the various facilities which are required for service injuries and illnesses. Veterans are now faced with the trauma of new surroundings and staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, in its wisdom, neglected to ask the people who use the veterans' hospital if they wanted an alternative venue. The disbursement of funds, which increases the bureaucratic jungle faced by the department, would be increasing total expense, not decreasing it, as a rationalisation program should. No longer do the veterans have the sense of stability in the knowledge that the medical staff would be familiar to them and would know the problems of the patients. Those living within close proximity of the hospital have to face changes in the facilities available since the privatisation of the Hollywood Hospital. The radiography and pathology units are no longer under the control of the hospital. Indeed, the pathology unit is now situated at the St John of God Hospital, some six kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The staffing levels of these facilities have also decreased significantly. For example, where radiography used to have between 12 and 16 staff members to cater for patients, under the new lease there are only four staff. Outpatients of Hollywood hospital are now not only facing the trauma of having their medical facilities altered greatly, but they are also facing an increase in the financial burden for necessary medication. Prior to the privatisation of the hospital, both inpatients and outpatients were able to use the registered pharmacist to collection prescriptions at a cost of $2.60. Since the change of owner, however, outpatients are required to pay the full cost of prescriptions dispensed from the hospital and then seek reimbursement. The only alternative they have is taking their prescriptions to another pharmacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many veterans do not have their own transport and need to rely on family and friends to take them to the hospital. By having to go elsewhere for necessary medication, the burden, which is placed not only on the veterans but now also on their drivers, is increased. The veterans who have previously used the hospital are also facing psychological battles. The new administration of the hospital decided that new medical files would be issued to all patients. It was with horror that many veterans found, on arrival for an appointment with a doctor at the hospital, that their previous records had apparently vanished. This resulted in many of the veterans contacting the Department of Veterans' Affairs to determine where their files had been placed. The issue of the records was made more confusing when it was revealed that the department was not aware of what had happened to these files. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most people prefer to have one doctor or centre which they attend. The alteration of hospital procedure is making the veterans relive the receiving of their injuries. This stability is of particular importance to many of the veterans who have been attending the Hollywood Hospital for decades. I can only begin to imagine the trauma which these people must have faced when they were placed under the impression that they would be required to recall their past problems to receive correct medical attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are the veterans undergoing a battle to keep the security which they have found in hospital but they are increasingly having to fight for the right to compensation for injuries and illnesses which they received during their service. The involvement of the Department of Veterans' Affairs with the claiming of compensation has recently increased dramatically. People in the RSL, which assists the veterans in the procedure involved, are currently being retrained in two-day seminars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A clear warning for what the federal government plans to install for the Australian veterans was highlighted in a case which was part of the Baume committee investigations. The Bushell case, which was recently resolved in the High Court, determined whether the Department of Veterans' Affairs had the right to overrule the decision of a medical specialist on a disability compensation claim. It had been determined that Bushell had started smoking through stress during the Second World War. The majority of state governments not only have legislation which bans cigarette advertising from sporting events but run comprehensive `quit' campaigns. Cases of businesses being sued for passive smoking are becoming a common event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government, however, will not admit that issuing cigarettes in military ration packs during the Second World War and the Vietnam War may have induced soldiers to start smoking and, as a result, they are now dying of lung cancer. A decision by the High Court, with only one dissenting judge, that the Department of Veterans' Affairs cannot override the findings of that qualified medical specialist was still not good enough for the government. In fear that it would have to give yet more money to the brave men and women of Australia, the government sought any legal advice which could override the precedent which had been set. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Baume report, which is to be tabled next week in parliament, addresses many issues which are of grave concern to veterans. It would seem that the decisions made in this report, which will affect the lives of many thousands of Australians, have been made without referring to the Returned Services League. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the minister's comment yesterday in answer to a question, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, irrespective of any recommendations of the Baume committee, I can assure the House that all legitimate claims will continue to be recognised and that no significant changes will be made without consultation with our ex-service community.</PARA>
<PARA>In Western Australia, neither the state executive nor the chairman of the state veterans' affairs committee has yet seen the Baume committee report. Is it any wonder that veterans are fearful of the implications that this report has in store for them? In the past, veterans have had the RSL to reassure them in times of need. By keeping this organisation at bay on important recommendations, this security blanket is being taken away. The offer of assistance by the Department of Veterans' Affairs is barely a substitute. Like any other government department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs must abide by the rulings that the federal government brings down. I can only hope that the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs&mdash;good fellow that he is&mdash;follows what he has stated about not adhering to all the recommendations of the report. Although these veterans have fought long and hard for our country, it seems that their battle continues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I want to grieve for the Aboriginal people who are victims of what I see as the Aboriginal industry which, while absorbing an enormous amount of taxpayers' funds, is clearly not benefiting the Aboriginal people. In my own electorate, there are many areas where housing is appalling. The last time I had a look at Jiggalong community, for instance, it needed 42 houses. The number today would probably be closer to 80. We will only ever build a few houses at a time&mdash;five houses this year, five next year. When the houses are built, they are overcrowded. They are often catering for 30 people, sometimes more. Because of this overcrowding, the houses deteriorate rapidly. Doors will only open and close so many times, the toilet will only flush so many times before a breakdown does occur. When the breakdown occurs, of course, we blame the victims. We say, `These useless blackfellows: we give them all this infrastructure and they destroy it.' I find that particularly offensive and it is certainly counterproductive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a way around it and I believe it must be addressed. I am presently looking at a proposal&mdash;not a new one; one I put forward 12 years ago at least&mdash;to involve Aboriginal people in the construction of their own houses. It is interesting to note that where people are involved in the construction of their houses there is certainly a greater pride taken in them. They are not subject to the same vandalism and more care is generally taken of them. I think this occurs throughout society, in whatever country or whatever ethnic group we happen to be talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the present system of house construction, we bring in a house from outside. We say to a contractor, `You must employ Aboriginal people.' He promptly jacks his price up by 20 per cent to accommodate the cost. The training given to these people is minimal. It is simply, `Hold this. Stand there. Do that,' to the end of the program&mdash;usually about 16 weeks. Then they throw them back on the scrap heap. If we could change that to a system where we use local material and the cost is transferred from material to labour, we could build a much cheaper house. We could have a much greater degree of actual Aboriginal ownership of the property and we could have a continual process where people would learn real skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, with the interest being taken in Australian heritage matters, there is going to be a big demand for stonemasons in the future. If we follow this program, maybe in 30 years time the only stonemasons available will be Aboriginal people and they will be able to demand a very high price for their labour. In the meantime, we can provide much better housing if we go about it this way. We do not need to build a four-bedroom house for a young couple starting out; a two-bedroom house is adequate. As a new child arrives, the building group comes back and puts on another room. If the design is appropriate to accommodate this, the growth of the house is quite easy and can be done without much disruption. This would enable us to house these people much more quickly than can be done at the moment and in houses in which they have a big stake. But that is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this project has the strong support of Cedric Wyatt, the Director of the Aboriginal Affairs Planning Authority in Western Australia, but we are going to have to set a pattern. It is ironic that the much abused mining industry is the source of that funding. I am hoping that negotiations with the mining industry will be successful and we can get the mining industry to fund the trainer and the necessary vehicle. We have many communities picked out where we think this would be appropriate and would be welcomed. We would be looking first at one in the Wittenoom area in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one sees the money being poured into Aboriginal affairs, one must speculate as to what is happening. Today we are spending on Aboriginal affairs money that would buy every Aboriginal family in Australia a new house every two years. Clearly, they are not getting it. The money is not doing what it is supposed to do. I have said before in this House that we should be asking ourselves: what is the point of the Aboriginal affairs policy? Is it to improve the lot of Aboriginal people? If that is the case, I do not think it has been a great success. I have Aboriginal communities that 30 years ago used to kill their own meat, bake their own bread and grow their own vegetables. Today that is all bought frozen from capital cities. The consequent cost and effect on their lifestyle and standard of living have been quite dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that alcoholism in Aboriginal people is very much a result of sheer boredom and frustration. It is interesting to note that, in areas where we have been able to get genuine work programs going, alcoholism and absenteeism have abated considerably. I believe the great bulk of Aboriginal people want to participate in the wider community and are being thwarted because governments of both persuasions tend to listen to the self-appointed spokespeople. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said in the House during the debate on the Mabo legislation that there was no consultation with the Aboriginal people in my electorate even though I represent more Aboriginals than any other member of parliament in this place. In fact, one of them wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and got a reply from the minister then responsible&mdash;the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker)&mdash;saying that because of the complexity of the issue and the distances involved the government had decided to consult only with ATSIC, the Kimberley Land Council and the Aboriginal Legal Service. None of these bodies are representative; certainly none of them have the support of the great bulk of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation now is that the government is looking at establishing a very large land acquisition fund.

He is not a great supporter of ATSIC, but these Aboriginal people are terrified of land councils. They know the land councils do not represent them, and the Kimberley Land Council is a particular problem. It has very little real support amongst Aboriginal people, although it appears to have the ear of the media and of both major political parties in Western Australia. It is ironic that so often the voices of the people we should be listening to are so totally ignored. The government should heed the advice and demands of Aboriginal people that no new body be set up to handle the land acquisition funds but that they be handled through the existing body, which Aboriginal people think can be made much more accountable than it is today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to demonstrate, in the couple of minutes left to me, how the myth of self-management works. It is a process by which we continually blame the victim. We look at the budget for a station property which an Aboriginal community has acquired. Every station property needs a five-year plan. So we fund the first year, probably late in the year, and then we do not deliver the next year's money until much later in the year and the money cannot be acquitted in time. If the money is not acquitted it is rolled over so the same money is there for the third year. So Aboriginal communities then call in white contractors to do the work and we then say, `Look at these lazy so-and-sos, they get the gubba to come and do the work', when the only reason they do that is that they know they cannot acquit the money in time. We see stations which are in desperate need of capital for stock being denied this money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that there are people who realise that if the Aboriginal people had the stock they would be self-sufficient and would not be dependent; it seems to me that what is wanted continually by the Aboriginal industry is dependence, not self-sufficiency. The town of Roebourne is an example. Roebourne has been through its traumas. The Aboriginal community committee there decided that it would fund a children's wading pool to go with the very large new pool which the state government provided to the town. The committee wanted the wading pool because Aboriginal children are often charged with looking after siblings and they cannot take them into the big pool; young children are not allowed into the pool unless they are accompanied. The ATSIC committee in Roebourne saw this as a very good, socially useful expenditure of money that also would have very strong implications for health and welfare. The decision was thwarted by bureaucrats in Canberra, who said the proposal was outside the guidelines and that the funding should come from state government or local government&mdash;the state government has already made a massive contribution there. The population of Roebourne is 98 per cent Aboriginal. The Aboriginal people made a decision, but their self-determination was thwarted by Aboriginal bureaucrats in Canberra whose vested interest is in maintaining forever the massive industry which they have established. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fundamental accountability and electoral processes in Australia are now being challenged at the federal, state and local government level. The most recent example of this erosion of Australia's democracy is the recent ruling by the United Nations Human Rights Committee that certain sections of the Tasmanian criminal code are in breach of international law. This is not an argument about the rights or wrongs of the Tasmanian criminal law, nor a suggestion that the Commonwealth should not have the external affairs powers granted to it by section 51 of the constitution for judicious use in particular circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For decades, the use of this power allowed the Commonwealth to make and enforce laws relating to shipping, international trade and various criminal matters having international ramifications. But, during the 1970s, the Whitlam government decided to use the external affairs power to implement international treaties which have had significant domestic effects within Australia but which were otherwise beyond the scope of Commonwealth power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This power was tested in the High Court in the Franklin Dam case of 1983 when the High Court narrowly ruled against a Tasmanian government decision to construct a dam on the grounds that a piece of Commonwealth legislation&mdash;the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act&mdash;was a valid exercise of the Commonwealth's external affairs power. The four judges in the majority claimed that a Commonwealth law giving effect to a treaty was valid whether or not the subject matter of the treaty involved relationships with other countries or persons outside Australia. This decision opened the floodgates to an expansion of Commonwealth powers as evidenced by the following acts: the Racial Discrimination Act 1975; the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983; the Sex Discrimination Act 1984; the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Act 1986; the Ozone Protection Act 1989; the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992; the Disability Discrimination Act 1992; the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993; and the Native Title Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issue is not one of the Tasmanian legislation, although I make the point that the Tasmanian criminal code was voted upon by a democratically elected body accountable to its electors in a way that remains a pipedream for the citizens of some of the countries which make up the membership of the United Nations Human Rights Committee. The people of Tasmania have the political power and the legal capacity to remove the current Tasmanian government from office at the next election, unlike the ongoing United Nations Human Rights Committee which is accountable to nobody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human rights committee consists of 18 experts who are nominated for four-year terms. They are not elected. It is not a court of law. It does not follow established legal procedures, and it does not advance reasoned legal opinions for its decisions. The human rights record of some of the countries which are currently members of the committee, and which have recently sat in judgment on the Tasmanian case, is beyond belief. A 1993 report published by Amnesty International on human rights violations that occurred during 1992, whilst the committee was considering the Tasmanian case, provides some interesting background material. The report was littered with such phrases as `mobilisation of troops', `disappearance and torture of suspects', `extra-judicial execution' and `arrest without warrant and detention without trial'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ecuador is represented on the United Nations committee which has taken Tasmania to task. The Amnesty report details the case of Victor Cadena, who was detained by the Ecuadorian police for three days in July 1992. He was suspended from a rope with his arms tied behind his back. He was beaten and given electric shocks. Other persons engaged in peaceful protest in Ecuador in October of the same year were also tortured with electric shocks and threatened with being thrown from helicopters. How do these examples square with the right to privacy guaranteed in the UN covenant which the human rights committee seeks to enforce? Will the Ecuadorian delegate turn his attention to matters closer to home when he has solved the problems of Tasmania for which he is not accountable?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to another committee member&mdash;Senegal. During 1992, Senegalese government troops beat and killed civilians, including children, in the village of Bissine. Other detainees were reported to have had molten plastic dripped on their skin. The Senegalese government failed to investigate human rights violations, including cases of detention without trial, despite these very matters being referred to the same UN Human Rights Committee which dealt with the Tasmanian issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a particular strength of the Australian way of life that these abuses of power do not occur. We do not need to be instructed or supervised by unrepresentative committees who have only had a passing or theoretical awareness of genuine rights and freedoms. Australia has a strong tradition of due processes of law, free elections and government accountability, which is the envy of much of the rest of the world and which is not and has never been based on the approval of UN committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to Amnesty's comments about Venezuela, another committee member. Arrest without warrant and detention in cruel and degrading conditions were reported. Beatings and torture, near-asphyxiation with plastic bags and mock executions were also alleged. Investigation of these incidents made little or no progress. Yet the Venezuelan delegate condemns the laws of a democratically elected government for arbitrary interference with the privacy of Australian citizens who brought that complaint forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a total sham. What a grotesque farce that the Australian government is so willing to hand itself over for judgment to extra-legal committees who have no constituency or accountability to the Australian people. What an extraordinary double standard that this government and this Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who so regularly lecture us about national independence and a move away from constitutional monarchy, are willing to grovel this way before a committee composed in part of very undemocratic regimes having no stake in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can a treaty be interpreted if bald statements of opinion are offered in place of detailed logical reasoning?  Why should Australia commit itself to international treaties cast in wide terms and in general language?  No genuinely independent country should contemplate treaties or arrangements which do not spell out the full extent of their obligations and which leave that interpretation open to the whim and caprice of those member nations who for the time being are sitting in judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greatest shame of all is that the Commonwealth government is such a willing accomplice in allowing democratically elected state governments to be judged by these tribunals, who do not even allow the state government to appear before them. Australian states are not even recognised under international law and cannot put a case before the committee, which to many Australians is a denial of natural justice to the electors who vote a state government in or out of office. The absurdity of the situation is clear when four of the countries represented on the Human Rights Commission have laws against certain homosexual behaviour or practices similar to the Tasmanian situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recently enacted Industrial Relations Reform Act relies on the use of International Labour Organisation conventions to override state legislation and establish minimum standards and provide coverage to non-union labour and persons working under state awards. This is another powerful reminder of the extraordinary influence that the use of the external affairs power is having on domestic policy within Australia to concentrate power in Canberra based on unaccountable external bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Basel Convention on the Movement of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal came into force two years ago. Leaving aside questions as to what constitutes waste and the part played by the Greenpeace organisation in promoting the convention within the United Nations, the convention ultimately rests upon the proposition that international solutions alone can solve local waste disposal problems and that they must always override the decisions of otherwise sovereign states. Such a treaty would seem desirable enough on the surface but the convention, about which there has been no domestic political debate, has had the effect of taking the control of the transport of waste materials out of the hands of national governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our willing acceptance of international supervision of what constitutes waste and how it should be dealt with provides another example of how Australia can have views imposed upon itself by non-accountable bodies. In the final analysis, wastes have to be disposed of by local, state and federal governments. For political purposes within Australia this rampant new internationalism is a device for transferring power from democratically elected governments to foreign bureaucrats who have no constituency within this country. It portrays a total lack of nerve or confidence which is at odds with the government's newly found nationalism and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of this use of the external affairs powers, which also involves the Greenpeace organisation, relates to an attempt by that group to halt the construction of a power station in the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. Greenpeace has admitted that it is attempting to enforce an international convention, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and in doing so set aside decisions made by democratically elected bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do these issues have in common?  They focus attention on the simple fundamental question: is Australia a master of its own destiny or do our democratically elected state and federal governments have to be constantly second-guessing whether or not their legislation is going to measure up to the wishes of some group of bureaucrats in New York or in Geneva?  These people are not accountable to Australians through the ballot box. They often come from countries with besmirched reputations, countries which at best have but a nodding acquaintance with the democratic forms and procedures which have formed part of the Australian way of life for so long. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ignorance of the law is no excuse, but it is a great pity that we do not do more to educate people about the law and about the rules which operate. I am referring chiefly to matters of social security. In the last 12 months or so I have had numerous complaints from parents who could not have been expected to know that if they took their children overseas they would lose welfare benefits. I had the very sad case of a lone parent who had to undergo a very serious operation. When she came out of hospital she found it impossible to care for her nine-year-old daughter. So her sister in New Zealand rang and said, `Send Jenny across to me. You can't care for her. Send Jenny across to me for a month until you get back on your feet. I will look after her. I will pay her way across to New Zealand.' That arrangement was made but this lady, who exists only on welfare payments, discovered that she had to pay the Department of Social Security a couple of hundred dollars because she was not eligible for the family allowance she had been receiving for her daughter. There are many cases of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another matter I want the public to know about, and we have to publicise it. I cannot understand why the courts and solicitors do not make people more aware of this situation.

I used to have a good job, but I was injured in a car accident. I am 43 years of age. After I was injured in the car accident I was in hospital, had all any hospital debts&mdash;doctors fees, et cetera&mdash;and they told me that I would get compensation, through third party insurance. Finally, after a protracted period of maybe two years of hardship living on the social security payment, I got the princely sum of $200,000 compensation. So what did I do? I am 43 years of age with a wife and a kid, and was renting a house. So I bought a new house that cost $125,000. We have never had a car so I bought a car.' The money was spent very wisely, but what happened then? Nobody told this poor devil&mdash;and there are many poor devils who have seen me regarding these matters&mdash;that Social Security could send a great lumping bill and say, `Hey, mate, all those social security payments have to be refunded.'</PARA>

Mr Jeffrey Kennett's mate Mr Walker is building the casino there and is having everything changed because it is not big enough for him. Then Mr Kennett's mate Mr Walker gets the Grand Prix down there. Where is the Grand Prix going to go? It is to be built and run on private land at Albert Park Lake, and it happens to be very close to Mr Walker's new proposed casino. So you can imagine where the people will be staying when they go to the Grand Prix, which Mr Walker&mdash;who owns the casino and is Mr Kennett's mate&mdash;runs. The Grand Prix will not go to Phillip Island where there is already a track or Sandown; it will go to Albert Park Lake. Who owns Albert Park Lake? The people. Who is going to give it to a private person? Mr Kennett. Why is he going to do this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked this question at the Press Club earlier today and I gave the very simple answer that on budget night all will be revealed about what the government is doing on these things. The question implies that in some way there is some discretionary spending on the government's part which it must be bound to cover by a tax increase of some kind. Any society which values all of its people having an opportunity to work and to participate in the growths, fruits and prosperity of the society will recognise that a program of the kind outlined yesterday satisfies both the criteria of economic efficiency and equity, that is, equity on the basis that unemployed people are entitled to participate in the labour market, and on the basis that to have 360,000 people unemployed for 12 months or more is a drag on the efficiency of the national economy and skills formation. As we go into a stronger recovery we will need that complement of skills. So I would regard the package, even from the opposition's point of view, as something that the government should reasonably have done and, therefore, the doing of it a legitimate cost on the nation and the budget of the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implication of the question is that we should not be doing these things and that, if we do them, why are we not paying for them, and how? The opposition has disagreed all the way along with the government's fiscal strategy, a strategy which has now produced four per cent growth for the year. We are growing as fast as, or faster than, any other industrial country. We have already seen an increase in job growth of 250,000 over the year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of interjection, the Leader of the Opposition says, `What about interest rates?' Is he arguing that the marginally lower financing effect of $1.7 billion on the budget is not, in macro-economic terms, more than compensated for by greater efficiencies from the major micro-economic reforms of the labour market? Of course it is. The Leader of the Opposition is directing questions to me about interest rates. As he knows, at the moment there is not a lot of rationality in interest rate settings in the marketplace of this country and appealing to their vanity with a lower budget deficit, lower than it might have otherwise been, is simply not on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I might be able to manage that. There are two particular initiatives in the white paper which will go a long way towards improving the lot of small business and its operations in this country. The first is an acceleration of the simplification program for the Corporations Law. This program, which has been operating since the end of last year, has been well received by the community generally, particularly by the small business community with regard to that proposal dealing with the simplification of the rules governing exempt proprietary companies. Those are the 800,000-odd companies which are predominantly the vehicles from which many small businesses take their form. Removing a number of the requirements placed upon those companies in terms of the paperwork, the returns and the forms they need to supply to the ASC takes a lot of the burden off small business and should do a lot towards reducing costs. Acceleration of the program will allow more targeting of areas within the Corporations Law for simplification and should allow us to achieve our goals at a faster rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second initiative concerns major reforms to the way we deal with delegated legislation, that is, regulation. Many business organisations and individual business people often point to the unnecessary red tape, unnecessary regulation or regulation which may have had an aim at one point but which outlived its usefulness a long time ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms announced in the white paper will, for the first time, create a comprehensive electronic database of all subordinate legislation in this country. This will complement the program announced in last year's budget concerning all Commonwealth primary legislation, all statutes. So for the first time we will actually have a single database of all Commonwealth law, in effect, which is a basic requirement of government to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Combined with the establishment of the register, there will be provisions to periodically and systematically review regulation. Those provisions will ensure that when further regulation is made an adequate consultation process will be entered into, particularly with business. There will be effective analysis of the cost and benefit of the regulation and of whether there are alternative ways of achieving the same social end without unnecessarily putting a burden on business. There will also be improvements in the drafting of regulations so that it is consistent with the overall thrust towards plain English and simplified drafting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these initiatives have been warmly welcomed by the small business community in particular. They are seen as positive developments in getting unnecessary government regulation and burden out of the way of business so that it can get on with the important job of initiating other involvement in the white paper programs and can get on with the job of creating more employment for all Australians.</PARA>

The point of it is to give these people a chance to be case managed, to be assessed, and to understand what their work experience has been, what their educational attainments have been, where their suitability lies, what sort of training they might have, and what job placement might be available to them and where. This means that a group of people who would not otherwise be able to enter the labour market will be able to do so. They will have the chance to go into the mainstream labour market, the increase in which will be met from the product of the economy&mdash;employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the House that in the period between 1983 and 1989-90 the economy grew, on average, by about 4 1/2 per cent a year. The prospect is that, with a more flexible economy today, the economy could grow even faster. Over that period, we have had a job growth of just on two million. So with a recovery of the dimension we have today and with the prospects of it continuing, with low inflation, the aggregate employment coming to the economy will take up the new entrants to the work force and those people who, as a result of the white paper yesterday, will be case managed, assessed, trained and given a chance to take a place in the labour market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The landmark reports which the government has commissioned and received&mdash;from the Kelty task force report into regions, which held the most extensive consultations around this country probably ever in the regions of Australia; in the report of the Industry Commission, which was a report into regional Australia; and in McKinsey's study of regional Australia&mdash;found that regions which had a sense of cohesion and a sense of leadership about them performed better economically than those which had not focused their attention on their future, on their capacities, on their ability to create opportunities within regions and actually fund infrastructure and development within regions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, the government adopted a policy of strategic assistance to industry, the formation of regional economic development organisations and funding those organisations where they seek to develop strategic plans for regions which commit the business community, trade unions, community organisations, local government, et cetera. It has also changed the tax treatment of instruments, such as infrastructure bonds and pool development funds, so that for particular classes of important infrastructure for regions it is possible for a regional group to actually raise some of the capital in the private finance markets of Australia through these instruments in yesterday's white paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That contrasts substantially with the policy of the opposition in regional development. We find there that the honourable member for Maranoa, who is the shadow minister for rural and regional development, in a paper written to the opposition states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should consider regional development policy matters from two perspectives: business and family. The family oriented policies are of course essential to win the mums' and dads' vote and are also critical in the battle to keep skilled labour in regional and rural centres.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should consider a commitment to new and/or upgraded infrastructure. We need to set a figure&mdash;$1 billion, $3 billion; the actual number is insignificant&mdash;as an indication of our commitment to putting roads, dams, ports, airports, bridges, whatever into regional Australia. We should also then allude to some sort of assessment procedure by which regions can directly seek funding for these projects which are important to their development. A new bridge, road, et cetera, is a proven electoral winner. It is more concrete than a tax decrease because, unlike tax gains, it is very difficult to take away a new highway or a dam.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the motivation. He then goes on about community services:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need to offer the people of regional Australia a commitment to the provision of community services. The commitment traverses several portfolios including health, education and telecommunications. But again the actual dollar value is not important.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to speak in those terms. That gives an indication of an infrastructure fund of $1 billion or $3 billion&mdash;the number is insignificant. Basically they are proven electoral winners, he says. They have to keep the mums' and dads' vote together and the actual dollar amount is not important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing is very clear: now that the opposition has no policies, with the lid off the pork barrel, who is first in? The National Party.

But, of course, the honourable member for Mackellar is the shadow minister for urban and regional strategy. So she has the strategy, and he is the shadow minister for rural and regional development. We know the policy of the honourable member for Mackellar. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we win government&mdash;and we will at the next election&mdash;that is when we will make policy based on our principles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a system of rigid national assessment, it is not often practicable or effective to understand how each person has been affected by unemployment, to know what their qualifications and work experience have been, to know what their general aptitudes are and how they will respond to the prospect of being directed with training to a job. Hence, the government believes they need to be effectively case managed. That is why the government, in another important and milestone change, intends to establish a competitive market for the task of case management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as with telecommunications and the competition among Telecom, Optus and the private providers of telecommunication services are managed in a market by Austel, the government will set up a body to manage a competitive market to complement the work of the CES in providing private case management in this country. Case management may have a particular focus on the metal industries or on the tourism industry. As a consequence, we could develop and find a very effective complement in the labour market to the provision of case management and job placement.</PARA>

This will involve something like 2,500 people to 3,000 people in the process. From the top of my head, I cannot remember exactly how many additional people that requires over the case load which the CES currently undertakes, but it is a substantial and revolutionary change to the labour market, to the delivery of labour market programs and to the placement of the long-term unemployed into work and into training.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government absolutely intends to fulfil the commitment that was announced last year to ensure that by 1996-97 the deficit is down to around one per cent of GDP. I think that is a very important target to impose upon ourselves for a whole range of reasons, but not least to ensure a continuation of the productive growth in the economy that we have had to this point.

So I appreciate the honourable member's question as an opportunity to point that out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a proportion of GDP, Australia already has the third lowest government outlays among OECD countries. Using comparable OECD figures, general government total outlays in this country amount to about 38 per cent of nominal GDP. About two-thirds of that would be Commonwealth outlays. Out of the 19 major OECD countries, only the US and Japan have lower proportions and they are at around 35 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not only the third lowest ratio of outlays to GDP but also one of the most ambitious deficit reduction targets. In contrast to our target of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, the United States aims to cut its deficit to 2.5 per cent of GDP in fiscal year 1995 and 2.3 per cent by 1999. The United Kingdom has said that it hopes to balance its books not by 1996-97, or even 1997-98, but by the end of this century. Canada&mdash;again, a country that we are being invited to pay attention to, because of its current deficit reduction strategy&mdash;is targeting a deficit of three per cent of GDP by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the difference between our target and Canada's target in Australian terms would be some $10 billion. We are not going to walk back from our strategy of progressively reducing the budget deficit to around one per cent of GDP in 1996-97. We are proud that our target in that regard is vastly superior in effort to that of all those countries we like to compare ourselves with.</PARA>

As a result of the changes to social security under the white paper, unemployed persons who earn less than $100 per week in addition to their benefits will be worse off than they are currently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government made it very clear in the statement that it has changed the taper and incentives so we do not have a position where people who earn one dollar of income lose it from their unemployment benefit. In a milestone change, instead of income testing two people as one, we are giving the half married rate unemployment benefit to each partner of a couple. As a consequence of having a diminished taper of 70 per cent and couples being separately income tested, the person who is unemployed&mdash;the husband, if the wife is at home&mdash;will not be in the former position where an increase in private income actually diminished the total payments of unemployment benefit to the family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen now is that a breadwinner, a husband, can earn $230 a week above the benefit. As a consequence, not one dollar will come from the spouse's benefit. When earnings go beyond $230, 70 per cent will come off the spouse's benefit so that the family income will rise. That is the benefit of changing the taper arrangements. That is why 118,000 families will be $59 a week better off.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="361" SPEAKER="Walker The Hon F.J." NAMEID="9T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ROBERTSON" MINISTERIAL="ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9T4">Mr WALKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most of the attention to the white paper has been quite properly given to the labour market reforms. There are also included in that white paper some very significant reforms in respect of government purchasing policies. As all honourable members know, the government purchases something like $12 billion worth of goods and services a year. As the Bevis committee report&mdash;one of the most outstanding reports I think this House has seen in many years&mdash;points out, developing a proper industry policy in relation to government purchasing is going to have a very significant economic impact indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small to medium businesses were given a lot of attention in the Bevis report because they were complaining, quite rightfully so, that they were disadvantaged to some extent by the current guidelines on government purchasing policy. The white paper goes a long way to meeting those complaints by small business. I will summarise those provisions in the white paper that give assistance to small and medium sized enterprises in Australia. The first provision is the introduction of a series of arrangements to facilitate purchases from small and medium enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is the development of the two-envelope tendering system for acquisitions valued at more than $10 million. This is a system that will require people tendering for contracts to place two envelopes in the tender process, one of which has an industry development policy in it. This will focus the minds of those tenderers very much on the  development of that policy. We feel that that recommendation of the Bevis report will be very advantageous indeed, particularly to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also there was a recommendation establishing an endorsed supplier approach for common day-to-day purchases of information technology and major office machines and a requirement that the government agencies prepare industry impact statements for major acquisitions valued at more than $10 million not covered by common use contract arrangements. The Bevis committee recommended that that figure be $30 million. I am sure it would be pleased that the government has actually decided to bring it in at $10 million. So there are a number of measures for small businesses, including a supplier development program that aims to further improve the understanding of suppliers about the Commonwealth government marketplace and to improve their skills in dealing with Commonwealth government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also there is a program of support for Australian suppliers which will give industry information on government purchasing needs to small businesses while also keeping the government itself informed of the potential of those small businesses to supply goods and services to government, particularly in areas like IT, communications products, electronics, building materials, furniture and processed foods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major beneficiaries of all these recommendations will be local firms, particularly small to medium-sized businesses that have always had difficulty getting into government markets. So, together with the various other measures that are already in place, the government feels that small business will be for the first time in some time getting a very good deal in this white paper. I bring this to the attention of the House because I think it might have been overlooked in recent media reports.</PARA>

Given the bipartisan opposition in this House to the exploitation of children and in line with article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which we are a signatory, is it not now incumbent on the government to institute legislation designed to either prohibit or impose severe tariff penalties on imports in circumstances where children are subjected to the kind of exploitation which this House would deem immoral?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure it is a matter of great satisfaction to all honourable members that in the same week as we have seen a new democratically elected government emerge in South Africa there has also been an important move in the Middle East peace process&mdash;another international problem which has sometimes seemed dangerously intractable. Australia joins with other members of the international community in warmly welcoming the signature in Cairo by Prime Minister Rabin and PLO chairman Arafat of this agreement for autonomy in Gaza and in Jericho.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a real milestone in the quest for a peaceful solution of the Arab-Israeli dispute. The agreement is also a tribute to the leadership in Israel and the Palestinian leaders who continued to negotiate in the face of terrorist attacks calculated to disrupt the process. It is also a tribute to people like the Secretary of State of the United States, Warren Christopher, and President Mubarak of Egypt, who worked so hard to reinject momentum into the talks when they seemed to stall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement will now lead to the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and Jericho&mdash;not so long ago this would have seemed inconceivable&mdash;their replacement by a Palestinian police force and the release of 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in the next three to four weeks. This lays the groundwork for a better economic environment. It will be vital in the period ahead that both sides do all they can to restrain those who might seek to sabotage the peace process with further violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that this agreement will lead to the resumption as soon as possible of full bilateral talks between Israel and its Arab neighbours. In this regard, Prime Minister Rabin's recent confirmation that Israel is willing to make serious concessions on the Golan for the sake of peace is very welcome and brings hope for real peace between Israel and Syria even closer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again take this opportunity of congratulating those two leaders. I make the point again that, while Australia is not a principal party in the Middle East, we have shown our willingness in practical ways to support the cause of peace through our three-year, $15 million contribution to economic development in the occupied territories, our participation in the peace processes and multilateral working groups on water resources and arms control, and our long support for peacekeeping operations, such as the Sinai MFO, which is now under Australian command.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listen to the answer. Unemployment is around 6 1/2 per cent and the view of many people in the US economy is that the US is reaching its potential in terms of employment&mdash;there is near full employment. As a consequence of this, given the fact that American fiscal policy plays a relatively small role in public policy because of the incapacity of the Congress to change it, much of the load has fallen to American monetary policy. Therefore, observing the  growth and inflationary prospects, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, Mr Greenspan, and his board have increased interest rates from three to 3.75 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just slightly above the inflation rate, whereas in Australia the 90-day bill rate was 4.75 to five per cent off an inflation rate of under two per cent. We had a real rate on the short end of around three per cent; the US had a real rate on the short end of around one per cent. Therefore, it was not unnatural for the United States to increase its interest rates in an environment where it believes its resources are more fully employed. This is not so in Australia, with employment around the levels that we have them and with a lot of plant and equipment underused and not near full capacity. We had two totally different circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what happened? The lemmings of the bond market sold their bonds. When people sell a bond&mdash;let me explain this in ABC terms&mdash;and the price goes down, the yield goes up. When the bond gets less valuable, the yield rises for a given coupon. Do you understand that? Therefore, out of absolute failure to understand the differences between the two economies, lemming-like, they sell their bonds and the yields rise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is supposed to say, `Oh well, in that case we will go over the cliff with the lemmings. We won't worry about the half a million people who are unemployed; we won't worry about a more efficient micro-economic change in the labour market; we won't worry about skill shortages in a recovery; we won't worry about complements to skill formation. We'll spend the money reducing the budget deficit.' Meanwhile, there is no guarantee that there will be any change in interest rates. The people who are now talking their book, having sold the bonds cheaper, are no longer going to commit themselves to the fact that they can take a lower interest rate. If they take a lower interest rate, it means the price of the bond rises. So that magnifies the mistake which they have already made. So they are talking their book. You want to regard the fact that they are talking their book as some sort of highly spiritual mystic science. But the rest of us have to say, `Oh well, they're a free financial market. They must have got it right.' Grow up! For God's sake, grow up!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper that was brought down yesterday in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is all about spending, training and politics; it is not about jobs. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the response to unemployment, the most significant social problem confronting this country today, by the Prime Minister yesterday was fundamentally flawed on four major counts. Firstly, it does nothing to create real jobs; it just worries about protecting one job, and that is his job. Secondly, it will only shuffle the unemployment queues and, unfortunately, it will probably work to lengthen those queues. Thirdly, it is unfunded. Fourthly, it will inevitably lead to higher interest rates and higher taxes, which will ultimately cost jobs. The response shows yet again that the Labor Party cannot solve the unemployment problem which it created because, quite simply, the Labor Party itself is the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister tried desperately yesterday to put himself alongside Ben Chifley. I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that he failed and he failed abysmally. Forty-nine years ago Ben Chifley's white paper clearly committed his government to full employment. Ben Chifley put the light on the hill and committed his government to full employment, yet yesterday our Prime Minister gave up on full employment. The white paper was his white flag of surrender on full employment. Ex-Senator Peter Walsh got it right when he said that the Prime Minister is once again mouthing Chifley rhetoric as a poor substitute for sharing his beliefs, especially his belief that economic growth has a paramount role in improving the life of ordinary Australians. Chifley's voice is once again being muffled by the Zegna suits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strange thing about the Prime Minister's failed attempt yesterday to associate himself with Ben Chifley is that I remember not all that long ago, just a few years ago, it was the same Prime Minister who was happy to cause something of a brawl within his party by calling Ben Chifley a plodder. We will all remember when Placido Domingo called Ben Chifley a plodder. Now it suits the Prime Minister to associate himself with Ben Chifley because he is absolutely desperate to win back the so-called true believers who have left the Labor Party since the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the white paper has nothing to do with the Chifley Labor tradition, but it has everything to do with the Whitlam Labor tradition. Gough Whitlam has been his tutor, not Ben Chifley. The Prime Minister has been introduced to the idea that when he does not have a policy he pretends that the problem can be solved by throwing more and more money at the problem. That white paper in the House yesterday was all Whitlam, and I have to say that it was Whitlam without style. The Prime Minister has been boasting for months how innovative and how clever this statement was going to be. There was nothing innovative in it at all. It was just a lazy Whitlam copycat&mdash;another big spending spree&mdash;and, as the Prime Minister would say, it was low altitude stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has been made necessary by one single fact: this Labor government has presided over the most disastrous failure of economic policy in the postwar era. It was Labor's policy failure that resulted in the worst recession and the highest rate of unemployment in Australia since the Great Depression. But beyond the raw statistics, the Labor policy failure has also had a devastating set of social consequences in terms of family breakdown, homelessness, rising crime rates, and the creation of a permanent underclass. The legacy of Keating's Labor is the permanent underclass of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts, and these facts alone, explain why there is a white paper at all. It is all about Paul Keating the Prime Minister trying to make up for Paul Keating the Treasurer. It is the Prime Minister's belated and, I would have to say, totally inadequate response to the social and economic disasters that he personally caused. No-one should ever forget that fact. I do not believe that anybody ever will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This white paper is not what the government has been promising to deliver for quite some time because, as is usually the case, it has once again fallen well short of the expectations that the Prime Minister and his ministers set out to create. Last year, for example, we were promised not one but three major statements&mdash;three separate big bang statements&mdash;one on industry policy, one on regional development policy, and one on unemployment policy. After all that hype, what did we get? The new industry strategy and the much vaunted regional development strategy have been tossed by the wayside. We now simply have an employment statement, with industry policy initiatives that are nothing short of a total cop-out, and with a regional development initiative that looks more like taxpayer funded public relations exercises on the government's behalf rather than any genuine attempt to reinvigorate the desperate and neglected areas of regional and rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt to deal with Australia's unemployment crisis in this white paper will take us, I believe, one step forward but two steps back. It is not a white paper about employment. It is not a white paper about growth. It is a white paper about training schemes and it is all about hiding the unemployed. This is absolutely classic Labor in terms of its response to the unemployment problem. Labor created the problem, then ignored it, tried to fudge it, tried to conceal it, and then threw money at it but, of course, Labor cannot and never will solve it. It will never solve the unemployment problem it has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy is that this white paper tries to address a national unemployment crisis that should have been avoided. We did not need to have the recession. Australia&mdash;with our people, our talents and our resources&mdash;should never endure entrenched mass unemployment as it is at the moment. There is only one reason for unemployment in the 1990s: the total mismanagement and the total policy failures of this government under Paul Keating's policies as Treasurer and Paul Keating's policies as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Secretary to the Treasury, Ted Evans, said recently, the record levels of unemployment and the social consequences being endured by Australians were a clear matter of choice. Let me emphasise it, `a clear matter of choice' by this government. The government chose 10 per cent plus unemployment and it chose to put almost half a million Australians out of work for more than a year. It made that choice in preference to putting other policies in place that would have brought about different outcomes. Yesterday, most disturbingly, it reconfirmed that choice because it failed to change the policies that caused the problem in the first place. Once again the arsonist Keating would have us believe that he can now play fireman. Nobody is going to be fooled by that. Having lit the raging fires of unemployment, he is now making a big man of himself by trying to put them out with buckets of other people's money and buckets of words. I was amazed yesterday he did not drown in all that rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we recognise that this is a longstanding approach by this government. In fact, this is Labor's 25th attempt in a bit over 10 or 11 years to actually deal with the problem. It has had 11 budgets, nine May economic statements, three prime ministerial statements, and the notorious One Nation statement. This Labor government can look back on a record that is a disgrace for a so-called Labor government, and on a record that has been a clear-cut disaster for Australia. It has given us the worst recession in 60 years. It has given us record levels of unemployment and it has given us a decline in real wages for Australian workers. How can they call themselves a Labor government? What an amazing trifecta for a so-called Labor government. This Prime Minister recently condemned himself and his government out of his own mouth when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will never be able to say that we have succeeded as a nation so long as we have several hundred thousand men and women and their families unable to find work.</PARA>
<PARA>He has been damned out of his own mouth because that statement, that quote, provides a clear-cut benchmark against which this Prime Minister's unemployment record and this white paper must be judged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are very clear. Under the Prime Minister's policies Australia already has, and has had for some time, hundreds of thousands of people unemployed. There are 200,000 people who have been unemployed for two years or more, 350,000 people who have been unemployed for one year or more and 360,000 women who are unemployed. Just over 900,000 Australians are unemployed. This Prime Minister has failed utterly by his own standards of assessment of his government's performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the consequences of Labor's disastrous employment record go well beyond those very bland economic statistics, devastating as those statistics are. It is the social consequences of Labor's mass unemployment that will always be what this Labor government is remembered for&mdash;and I believe it is what they will be condemned for. Creating one million unemployed and then virtually doing nothing about it has had the effect of significantly increasing some of our worst social problems: family breakdown, homelessness, health problems, drug and alcohol abuse and crime rates. We are facing, I think, the possible creation of a permanent underclass in this country. ACOSS, the Salvation Army and the Brotherhood of St Laurence all agree that poverty in Australia is created&mdash;and I emphasise `created'&mdash;by unemployment. The despair, financial strain, family problems and loss of personal dignity caused by unemployment lead to chronic social problems that undermine our basic Australian values of equity and a fair go for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is always avoiding addressing these issues. It never wants to talk about the social consequences of unemployment. The white paper yesterday had precious little to say about these at all. If, indeed, we go back to the bigger document, the green paper on unemployment that was released late last year&mdash;a document of some 240 pages&mdash;only one paragraph dealt with the social consequences of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a broader sense, this white paper must be seen in the context also of the cynical abuse of the people's trust that this Prime Minister has made his hallmark. The government has always promised the earth and consistently failed to deliver. It has always made, and knowingly made, claims about its own policies which it knew would be misleading and which it knew to be wrong. The Prime Minister, for example, is always saying that our problems are about to be solved and that he has a solution that will cost little or nothing and we should not worry about the detail. What he has delivered, of course, as I have said, is a recession, unemployment, more taxes and less investment. </PARA>

<PARA>In 1988 he told everyone that we were well on the way back to prosperity when, in fact, we were in nothing more than a boom-bust cycle. It was a time when he was boasting that his budget was the one that would bring home the bacon&mdash;another porky from the king of porkies. He told everyone then, in February 1990, that there would be no recession and that we were going to have what he called `a soft landing'. This was at a time when the number of unemployed people already stood at over half a million. Only six months later in the 1990 budget, when the number of unemployed then exceeded 600,000, he told everyone that economic policy was working&mdash;and I emphasise what he said&mdash;`without the misery and despair of high unemployment and a savage recession'. That, without qualification, is a disgraceful lie. What callous insensitivity from the man who yesterday spoke of fairness and compassion, and berated us in here today about the issue of compassion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on later and surpassed himself. He said, `These are definitely the golden years of change.' `Of course they were the golden years of change,' he said. They certainly were not the golden years of change for the 840,000 Australians who were out of work at the time of the next budget in 1991. Indeed, it took until the 1992 budget&mdash;by which time there were 940,000 Australians who were unemployed&mdash;for Labor to finally acknowledge the reality of mass and retrenched unemployment. By the time it did, Australia was already in a national crisis of unemployment which it has not yet recovered from. Yesterday, the man who has been responsible for more political confidence tricks than anyone else put his hand over his heart and did it again: he made another great promise to the people of Australia. Mark my words, it is another promise that he will break as soon as it suits him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This white paper is more about positioning Paul Keating politically than having anything to do with any genuine attempt to fix the unemployment crisis that his policies have created. For him, the main purpose of the white paper is very clear: to fudge the reality of Australia's unemployment problem and to devise ways of moving people from unemployment out of the labour force altogether and, thus, to artificially reduce the measured level of unemployment. The Prime Minister made a lot of promises yesterday, but the fact is that nobody believes our Prime Minister any more. You know something: they are dead right not to believe him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is the One Nation document all over again. It is the document which the Prime Minister hopes will let him lie his way through the next election, just like the One Nation document allowed him to lie his way through the last one. Just like the One Nation document, this white paper is unsustainable and undeliverable because, like One Nation, the government will fudge its growth forecasts simply because it cannot afford what it has promised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will remember that One Nation promised $8 billion worth of tax cuts. They were entrenched in law, I remember, l-a-w tax cuts, for those who doubted the Prime Minister's word. He promised an investment avalanche. He promised that the budget deficit would rocket back into surplus by 1995-96. Straight after the election, of course, the magnitude of that con became very clear: over half the tax cuts were immediately ditched, investment hit a 40-year low&mdash;hardly an avalanche&mdash;and the budget was firmly back in deficit for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This white paper will go exactly the same way. Isn't it interesting? Just notice the way the government has structured it. Only $1.1 billion of the $6 1/2 billion worth of promised expenditure is going to be delivered in the next 12 months. True to form, the Prime Minister wants the credit for the $6 1/2 billion, but he has to make his budget look responsible. He knows he cannot, and he never will, deliver the $6 1/2 billion. Just watch him. He will talk his head off in coming months all over Australia about his great promises and his great spending&mdash;always talking about the $6 1/2 billion. But get ready. If he were to win the next election, it would not take long before he would be looking for the backdown. He would be looking for the backdown straight after that election. Just like more than half the tax cuts promised in One Nation and a host of other promises, much of this white paper would bite the dust because the government would not and could not pay for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, this government has made an art form of distracting people's attention from the reality of Australia's unemployment problem. For years, the government has created a smokescreen of acronyms, name changes and pots of gold at the end of any rainbow to obscure the real problem. We have had one grand labour market initiative after another. We have had CEP, SEP, EIS, special youth employment training, the adult wage subsidy scheme, jobstart mark 1, jobstart mark 2, jobtrain, ATS, NEIS, labour adjustment assistance, jobsearch, training programs, post-placement support, LEAP, CEEP, ATI, CAP and LAPs&mdash;and all of this is just the tip of the iceberg. If acronyms were jobs, there would not be an unemployment problem in this country. Since the government came to office over 11 years ago, it has introduced 45 new programs, all accompanied by the same hype, all being said to be saviours and all failing in the end, of course, to deliver what was promised. In this white paper even more unemployment schemes and acronyms have been created with the same hype and the same promises, if we know how to read them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After years of denying the reality of Australia's unemployment crisis, Labor has again decided to fudge and conceal the fact that it is not prepared to change its policies to solve the problem. The priority for Labor is to conceal the true extent of Australia's unemployment crisis. For Labor, as long as the unemployed are out of sight, they are out of mind. This is Labor's whiteboard strategy for the unemployed: list them on the whiteboard as unemployed, move them across to a job compact or training scheme, and then rub them out so they do not get counted in the unemployment numbers. Ben Chifley, I reckon, would turn in his grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With what was announced yesterday in terms of the new programs and schemes, we estimate that a couple of hundred thousand people will be dropped out of the unemployment statistics; they will be hidden from the unemployment statistics. The reality of the magnitude of the unemployment problem will be hidden because schemes like the job compact, the ATS entry level training and the mature age allowance take people out of the numbers&mdash;they make the numbers look better&mdash;but with no prospect of a job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they will be back. It will just be a matter of time. They will probably start to come back towards the end of 1995. And when is that? Not long after the next election. That is the way&mdash;a cynical manipulation of the whole exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this white paper is essentially about training and so it falls well short of a complete strategy to deal with unemployment. An effective response would be a strategy that would accelerate and sustain growth as well as train, retrain and place those presently unemployed in real jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of training, we recognise that more money needs to be spent but with a couple of qualifications. We want to make sure that the money presently spent is effectively spent. From what we have heard about DEET and its mismanagement and fraud in recent days, we have real doubts. Secondly, we know that these problems cannot be solved by throwing more and more money at them. We are not going to create jobs simply by throwing money at the problem. If it were that simple, the problem would have been solved long ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless the jobs are created, no amount of training will generate the extra private sector jobs that are required. The jobs will be generated only if they are underwritten by necessary business investment, yet every time this government does something it erects another impediment to investment or it does something else that would otherwise increase the cost of business employing more staff. If the growth is not forthcoming, the unemployed face the prospect of not only increasing in number but also going onto a needless merry-go-round, being moved from one training scheme to another but with no prospect of a job at the end. In the absence of appropriate growth we are just going to get shuffling and reshuffling of the pack of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will clearly discriminate in favour of the long-term unemployed at the expense of others. I can see some of the newer unemployed having to wait almost 18 months to get on a job compact to have six or nine months work experience rather than the chance of a job. The Prime Minister in fact conceded today that there is going to be a redirection of jobs, but as long as the jobs are not created in the end it is not much of a prospect for these people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also said that it is feasible to reduce the unemployment rate to five per cent by the year 2000. I think it is important to understand the magnitude of that task. An unemployment rate of five per cent by the year 2000 will require the government to generate something like 2 1/4 million jobs between now and then. That growth rate of five per cent has to be sustained in every year of the rest of the decade. Every time it falls short by one per cent, or 100,000 people, the government will fall short of its objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to set that figure in context. What is 2 1/4 million jobs? It is roughly twice the total number of tradespeople in Australia and nine times the number of school teachers in Australia. It is twice the number of people employed in manufacturing, five times the number of people employed in agriculture and 25 times the number of people employed in mining. It is therefore absolutely amazing that the white paper did absolutely nothing to underwrite the sort of growth thrust that is absolutely essential if we hope to achieve an unemployment rate of five per cent by the end of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are as concerned as the government to avoid a huge and dispirited mass of unemployed people, we should recognise the reality of what the Prime Minister did yesterday by not having a growth strategy. In failing to put proper policies in place to stimulate investment and to stimulate growth, he is guaranteeing this nation the prospect of something it does not want; that is, the reputation of having the best trained and best educated dole queues in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should be pretty pessimistic about those growth numbers because whatever way we look at the white paper, it is $2 billion of additional expenditure in every year. That is $2 billion that, unless it is properly funded, will be added to the deficit. By properly funded&mdash;we will not know, of course, until next week's budget&mdash;I mean by cuts in other expenditure or by increases in taxes. If it is not properly funded, the budget deficit will be $2 billion higher than it otherwise would be and interest rates will increase without a doubt. We do not need the first year economic lesson the Prime Minister tried to give us. Interest rates will go up if this is not properly funded. Interest rates going up works against the recovery, stifles investment and starts to destroy jobs that would otherwise be forthcoming. That is the downside of what was done yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also important to note from yesterday's announcement that there will be a massive new bureaucracy in the Department of Employment, Education and Training. As most of us know, DEET has experienced a phenomenal expansion in recent years; in fact, its staffing levels have virtually doubled since it came into existence in 1987. There will be an expansion of DEET's programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a commitment to individual case management of half a million Australians. The term `individual case management' worries me. I do not think of these as cases; these are people. The only case that has to be managed around here is the Prime Minister. Can honourable members imagine the expansion of resources that will be necessary to handle the half a million people that the government described as cases on an individual basis? There is absolutely no doubt: we are in for a new army of bureaucrats in DEET as a result of this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considering the way DEET has operated in the past, we have to have real concern. The evidence of fraud and abuse just cannot be ignored and the public cannot have any confidence in DEET's capacity to manage these labour market programs until there is a full, independent, judicial inquiry to get to the bottom of the extent of the mismanagement and fraud in that department. The government is going with a much more complex response and is expecting us to believe that DEET can handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some things in the white paper that we welcome. Why should we not? The government pinched them off us. I think it is a shame that it took a couple of years; it is wasted time. The introduction of training wages for young people and for adults, the parenting allowances, the shake-up of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the suspension, and hopefully abolition, of the training levy are all good things. I think it is remarkable, though, that it took two years for the government to do it. I think it is a particular pity when we think back to what it said about some of those initiatives. Members of the government described those training wages as slave labour and exploitation and they told a host of other lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude with a couple of comments on an appropriate growth strategy for unemployment. The centrepiece of any growth strategy has to be to improve the climate for medium and small sized businesses to begin to invest and to employ labour. I do not want to downplay the significance of big business, but the focus must be on small to medium sized businesses. If the Prime Minister wants to be champion of the unemployed, then he has to be champion of small business. Right now, for example, there are about 800,000 small businesses in Australia. Imagine if all of those businesses created just one job. That would make a substantial dent in the 900,000 unemployed. If we could get the system working and growing and new small businesses opening, there is no way we would fall short of what should be our objective; that is, anybody who wants to work in this country should be able to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of a successful small business strategy will be to get the government off their backs and to reduce or eliminate the imposts levied by governments which increase the costs of employing labour or discourage them from investment. For example, we should not only scrap the training guarantee levy, we should also freeze the superannuation guarantee levy and streamline its processes. Steps should be taken to reduce the impact of other taxes like payroll taxes and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses desperately need a break in capital gains tax so that they are not disadvantaged when they trade up their business, they get a proper recognition for goodwill and they can use their business as an appropriate way to build a nest egg for their retirement. Moreover, small business desperately needs to be freed of the excessive regulation of government that would discourage just about anybody from having a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small businesses suffer in terms of cost and access to finances. We have to do something about that. Not only do interest rates have to be kept down and bank margins reviewed, but I think it may also be necessary to do a bit of innovative thinking. What about the idea of a small business bank, perhaps by hiving off the Commonwealth Development Bank from a fully privatised Commonwealth Bank? Over and above that, the investment climate for small business must be reinvigorated and cost disadvantages from transport, shipping, waterfront, communications and power must be reduced by accelerating the pace of reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill that has just been introduced is an absolute disaster from the point of view of small businesses. It has had a very significant negative effect on their attitude to hiring staff. For example, many small businesses now find it preferable, and disturbingly so, to get their existing staff to work overtime rather than contemplate the possibility of hiring new people. The industrial relations legislation clearly has to be set aside if small businesses are to play the part they are entitled to play. Small business desperately needs a more flexible labour market if it is to survive, let alone expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the whiteboard stands as Labor's monument to fraud, waste and inefficiency, this white paper will equally stand as a monument to the Labor Party's total inability to deal with the problem of unemployment. Most of all, this white paper will remind the Australian people that this government has been in office for far too long. Yesterday, I noticed that the Prime Minister boasted that the white paper was Labor to the bootstraps. Only Labor could conceive it and only Labor could execute it, he said. I happen to agree with him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only Labor could deliberately create the worst recession in 60 years. Only Labor could tolerate one million unemployed Australians. Only Labor could effectively consign so many people to the unemployment queues and care so little about them, as it has done nothing about them for years. Only Labor could make promises about doing something for the long-term unemployed, as it did at the time of the last election, and then delay its response for so long. We still do not know where some of these measures will take their effect. Only Labor could so blatantly resort to fudging figures to artificially reduce the unemployment rate as the white paper does. You are dead right, Mr Prime Minister: only Labor could do this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can sum up the reply of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) pretty briefly: `You are there, we are here, and on that effort you're going to stay there.' This Labor government can be quietly proud of the initiatives included in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working nation</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the white paper on employment and growth. Despite the incoherent bleatings from some sectors of the financial markets, which appear to have little knowledge and experience of the real world of work, this white paper on employment&mdash;the first in 50 years&mdash;reflects Laborism at its best.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Ross Gittins correctly pointed out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> this morning, the white paper is not a quick fix and results will come over a period of three or four years. The white paper has resulted from consultation with many Australians over the last 12 months. It is balanced, pragmatic, flexible, creative and imaginative. Economic absolutes are taken into account and social and environmental imperatives quite rightly acknowledge our most precious resource&mdash;the skills and energies of our own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper recognises more than just cold, analytical, economic number crunching. It acknowledges and recognises the dignity and the right of all Australians to have the opportunity to obtain the prerequisite training and education with which to apply for skilled work. The white paper quite properly acknowledges the needs and aspirations of the most disadvantaged in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three major themes are evident in the white paper: sustaining high economic growth, training the work force and getting the unemployed back to work. The government quite clearly is committed to sustainable and high rates of economic growth and the creation of jobs. The white paper projects that more than one million jobs will be created by the year 2000. In the last 12 months, some 230,000 jobs have been created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic growth alone will not solve the unemployment problem. It is a national problem and national solutions are required. The white paper initiatives will boost industry and regional productivity, enhance international competitiveness and drive higher growth, which will translate into increasing  job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key theme is a renewed government commitment to training reform. For Australian firms to compete more effectively in the modern world marketplace, they need a flexible and skilled work force. There is therefore no doubt that access to training for all needs to be improved to generally widen the opportunities for skill formation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training needs to be focused, relevant to industry needs and demand driven. Training needs to lead to portable qualifications, and it needs to take into account not only current employment needs but also future employment needs. Training must not be buried in the past with outdated technology and methodology. Not only do we need to streamline arrangements for the recognition of training and improve the school to work transition; we need to consolidate the foundation years of schooling on which this is built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Long-term unemployment has costly consequences&mdash;economic, social and environmental. Skills are diminished. Social and personal alienation, crime, suicide, substance abuse, poor health and a more inefficient economy result from these factors, and they cost this nation billions of dollars each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third theme of the white paper quite rightly commits the government to ensuring that the long-term unemployed are not left behind during the current economic recovery. In previous recoveries, the vast bulk of new jobs&mdash;six out of every seven&mdash;went to new entrants to the labour market and not to the long-term unemployed. That must never be allowed to happen again. Without new programs and policies to assist the long-term unemployed, they will be left behind again. That is totally unacceptable to this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employment and growth white paper is a substantial and responsible package of assistance that totals $10.3 billion over four years. It will provide for job placements totalling 1,070,000 over those four years. These job placements are made up of approximately 560,000 jobs under the job compact, 420,000 under other subsidised job placements and 90,000 jobs under the youth training initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-term unemployed are particularly disadvantaged when seeking employment because employers prefer employees to have some recent work experience. The job compact will provide individual case management and access to a range of labour market programs, leading to a firm offer of a job placement for all people aged 18 years or over who have been receiving the jobsearch or newstart allowance for more than 18 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major feature of the job compact is the principle of reciprocal obligation; that is, the government will be required to offer a suitable employment place to each long-term unemployed person eligible for the job compact. The unemployed person in return will be required to accept a reasonable job offer or lose entitlement to income support for a period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To meet the special needs of unemployed people where existing labour markets offer few job opportunities, the government is introducing new work opportunities. In 1996-97, almost 50,000 positions are expected to be provided. The environment sector will provide key new work opportunities. The training and work experience of participants will assist in creating future job opportunities in the environmental repair industry, green product industries and ecotourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the extension of funding to the Australian Conservation Foundation for research into the future of green job opportunities in the areas of waste and water management, ecotourism and energy auditing. The potential of so-called green jobs in environmental management and technology should not be underestimated. There are also new work opportunities in the community sector and in education. The local human services employment program will provide structured training and flexible employment opportunities for up to 10,000 unemployed people. These placements will include personal care of the aged in nursing homes and workplace assistance to people with a disability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly welcome the recognition that the successful transition of young people from school to work is, in part, dependent on their literacy skills. I also welcome that a national survey of Australia's literacy skills will be conducted over the next three years. This government is also committed to assisting all unemployed people and will maintain and improve current labour market assistance to the non-job-compact unemployed. The number of places available for non-compact unemployed in a full year will average at 360,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the youth training initiative. There is no escaping the fact that the labour market for unskilled youth has collapsed. In the future, young unemployed people under the age of 18 will be provided with individual case management assistance to find suitable work, training or education placement rather than remaining out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifteen- to 24-year-olds make up over 25 per cent of the long-term unemployed. The total youth package will provide 50,000 places per year for 15- to 17-year-olds when fully implemented. This nearly doubles the current level of 26,000 commencements for the under-18s. There is a need to substantially expand entry level training opportunities if young Australians are to be provided with the skills needed in a modern economy. The white paper incorporates changes to increase entry level training places by 50,000 by the end of 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A civilised society looks after its disadvantaged. Indigenous people in this country still face longer periods of unemployment than any other group of Australians. They are three times more likely to be unemployed than others. The white paper will increase levels of labour market assistance to nearly 26,000 places by 1995-96, as well as a further $190 million over the next four years to some 25,000 people under TAP. In addition, there will be a further 3,750 places in the community development employment projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Women will benefit from this white paper. Over 200,000 places in labour market programs from 1995-96 are expected to be taken up by women. The disabled will benefit. The government will provide over 80,000 labour market programs for people with disabilities. Migrants will benefit. By 1995-96, the number of ESL places will more than double the 22,000 commencements in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper provides incentives for business&mdash;increased access to capital for business, particularly small business; the suspension of the training guarantee; a training wage for juniors and adults; reform of the CES and private competition for the CES; import replacement through an effective government purchasing policy; and increased access to research and development. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working nation</EMPHASIS>, the white paper on employment and growth, is a document that is a watershed in Australia. It is pro-business, pro-people and pro-Australian. I commend the paper to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, from the safety of the Senate chamber, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) chose to criticise me and attribute certain statements to me which are incorrect. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Mr Tuckey, who is the shadow minister, has issued only two or three press statements on small business in the whole 12 months he has had the portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Schacht has a background in political bureaucracy and obviously measures administrative excellence by press releases. But if this is so important, let me correct the number. I have issued over 50 press releases on small business since undertaking my responsibility in that area. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not possible with Wilson Tuckey or with most of the rest of the opposition because they are not up to score with what is happening in small business.</PARA>
<PARA>Unlike Senator Schacht, whose personal and present background has no small business involvement, I am still actively involved in the small business arena, dealing directly with all the regulations and charges such as increased fuel tax and sales tax that Senator Schacht has imposed on that sector. My contribution to the long-term unemployed is to give them jobs. I employ five apprentices and provide regular work experience opportunities to the unemployed. Numerous other opposition senators and members have a similar involvement. Senator Schacht also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning me&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">actually said to small business people, `Don't invest in your business.'</PARA>
<PARA>He went on at a later date to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need `Iron Bar' Wilson Tuckey to go around telling small business, `Don't invest.'</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in his speech, Senator Schacht claimed that he had a transcript of the television interview I gave on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press </EMPHASIS>last Sunday to which he referred. Had he read that transcript he would have seen that I specifically rejected a suggestion from a journalist that I was discouraging small business to invest. In fact, I said that I would encourage it provided small businesses use their own money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, what I did say, which was in line with comments by the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Bernie Fraser, was previously published in one of those press releases that Senator Schacht said I did not send out. That release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Shadow Minister for Small Business, Wilson Tuckey, today warned Small Business against contracting any debt while the Keating Government continues its high deficit policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said both rising economic activity and increasing small business confidence was the obvious trigger for small business operators to go back in to debt to fund expansion.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is positive. The press release continued:</PARA>

<PARA>meaning those items I just mentioned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would normally be a welcome progression, but as Prime Minister Keating continues to ignore the current need for a pro-active economic policy and a consequent substantial reduction in the deficit in the May Budget, it must be obvious to even the least economically literate, that in traditional style he will be obliged to react to any excessive economic growth with the only other economic policy available&mdash;higher interest rates.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have enjoyed listening to the speech by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford). You could be forgiven for believing that we were entering a new golden age. The trouble is that we on this side of the House have heard it all before. We have heard it time and time again. This paper is not a jobs paper; it is a training white paper. It has some fundamental problems that I will spend my time discussing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first concerns the nature of the training that people are being given. Secondly, this is only half a solution, because the other half of the solution that is missing is growth. Thirdly, where is the investment? Finally, we are paying for it on Bankcard. Although we have to wait till next week, we have a pretty good idea from the draft of the budget that was leaked by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) yesterday that this is all being paid out of growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a couple of fudges involved here. There is a fudge on the unemployment figure&mdash;there is a fudge on the number of the unemployed themselves&mdash;and there seems to be a fudge on case managers, which clearly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could not address in question time today. Finally, I want to talk about the fact that in 11 years of Labor we have had these sorts of promises, we have had these sorts of overly optimistic expectations time and time again, and they are never met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most important to remember that training does not equal a job. If training was all that was required to have jobs, we would have no unemployment in this country at all. I guess as a country we have never really come to grips with what we do with 15- to 19-year olds. So we kid ourselves now that people without adequate training can suddenly take some short cut, that they can suddenly do some short six- or eight-week training course, and that we can churn out program after program and make up for years; we cannot. The nature of the training that is being offered will be necessarily short term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not come to grips with the nature of the regional problem of unemployment. The fact is that between Coffs Harbour and Noosa there are well over 100,000 long-term unemployed Australians. That is not going to be fixed by any amount of job subsidy because the jobs are not there in the first place. We have also been told that after the period of training they will be offered a job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a bit optimistic, because what they will actually be offered is work for a period between six and 12 months, if they can find it. If it is not there, they will do some community work. That in itself may achieve very worthwhile social ends. Care for the aged or personal carers for the disabled will do a great deal of good in this country. But let us not kid ourselves that after this the long-term unemployed will suddenly have all their problems fixed. They will have a job for a period until it runs out, and then it will be up to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem concerns growth. We have never said that growth alone will fix the problem; it will not. The government's own green paper recognised this. The top of the second chapter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with suitable policies to promote economic growth, unemployment might be reduced as low as 5 per cent by the year 2000-01. In order to achieve a higher growth rate, policies would need to be directed toward increased flexibility in the labour market, income restraint, accelerated micro-economic reform and stronger productivity growth. Active labour market programs would also have a part to play in this process.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the trouble with the Public Service. When it does not like what we are doing it slips in those sorts of things in the report somewhere; they are buried. That is absolutely true. Without strong and sustained growth this is just a charade because the number of jobs is fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, you can churn the jobs between the long-term unemployed and the short-term unemployed and that might actually achieve some social ends. But there are no more jobs, and there are losers, and the losers are the short-term unemployed who will become the long-term unemployed because of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, this problem is going to be fixed by investment. It is going to be fixed by businesses being prepared to spend money&mdash;not BHP, not CRA, but small businesses; farms and other small business people spending the money to re-equip, to retool. But it is not happening. Coming out of the last recession our investment was up 23 per cent. That saw a surge in growth, a surge in employment and a drop in unemployment. Coming out of this recession, investment is not up; it is down. Compare this to the United States. The US is coming out of the recession and its investment is up 12 per cent. Business is not stupid. It just does not have confidence in the future. It is not going to have confidence while the problem is massaged, while the problem is tinkered with, while part of the problem is fixed but the fundamental causes not addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are paying for this on Bankcard; that is quite clear. We are paying for it on the never-never. Again, there may be very fine social ends that we are trying to achieve. But we do not achieve them if the net effect of what we do pushes up interest rates. That in itself will cost jobs. So in a perverse sort of way a white paper supposedly on jobs could end up costing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of this is all very interesting. We are 14 months into this parliament. Last year when the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), before he was Minister for Employment, Education and Training, was talking about this package he said that it would be in before the end of the year. It is in in May, but we have to wait another seven to 14 months to see a lot of it implemented. The centrepiece of it, the jobs compact, really does not crank up until next year. Some of the benefits, such as the partners benefit, will not start until July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If unemployment is such a social problem, as is said by speaker after speaker on the other side of the House, why the hell are we waiting between 21 months and 24 months after the election to do anything about it? It does not take that long to make the decisions and the changes. The reason is pretty simple: next year is an election year. If we take long-term unemployed off the queues, put them onto training and give them a job for nine months they will vanish from the figures next year, but I tell you what&mdash;they will be back in 1996. So the length of time to respond does not match the urgency of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned that the figures themselves may be fudged. One occasionally gets leaks. We had a tip-off some time ago. It said, `Watch the numbers very closely; they are going to be massaged.' Here is the massage. The jobs compact&mdash;160,000 in a full year lasting six to 12 months&mdash;will take about 120,000 at any one time off the figures. In regard to the parenting allowance, itself a worthy consideration, if half the 118,000 families come from the presently unemployed that will be 59,000 off the figures. An extra 1,250 places for CDEP will mean 1,250 Aborigines off the figures. A thousand new places for NEIS&mdash;they will come off the figures. There is to be an increase in the entry level training places of 25,000. Let us say there is a 70 per cent take-up of that. That is 17,500 people off the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the partners allowance, on the March figures there were 4,800 potential people eligible. Let us say that two-thirds of them are married and take it up. That is 3,200 off the figures. In regard to the mature allowance, introduced on 20 March, we do not know how many but the Department of Social Security newsletter tells us that 30,000 people have applied. They are people over 60, the long-term unemployed. They do not have a job and, quite frankly, under the current policy settings they do not have much prospect of a job. And what do we do? We redefine them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what we are going to do here is reduce the participation rate in the labour force artificially, reduce the numbers of unemployed artificially and massage the figures. I make it as much as 232,950; that is what it adds up to. Those Australians do not have a job but they have vanished until 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end this is going to come down to credibility. Looking back over 11 years of Labor, the rhetoric does not match the action. In the 1983 election campaign we had the opposition leader berating the fact that one in 10 Australians was out of work&mdash;in his words, `a figure no Australian would have believed possible and which no Australian government should ever be forgiven for'. That is true; the government will not be forgiven. Over time we have had a raft of programs and promises. It is important to run through them because it forms the basis on which we have to judge whether we are going to trust the present rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1983 we had a YEAST program, `youth employment and skills training'&mdash;40,000 places were promised and 30,000 places were created. But only 35 per cent of them still had a job three months later. In August 1985 we had Priority One. That offered some real hope for young Australians. It was the youth traineeship system. We were going to have 100,000 youth trainees. By February 1986 we did not have one. In the end, 20,000 were created. A lot of money was spent on advertising and lunch with executives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1985 we had the launch of jobstart. It was predicted that we would have 85,000 places. By the end of the financial year we had 42. In January 1988 we had jobsearch training for young Australians. The boast was that it was modelled on the Canadian program, which had a 60 to 90 per cent success rate. We got an 18 to 29 per cent success rate. In June 1991 we had newstart. This was going to coordinate Commonwealth employment and income support services&mdash;exactly what we are being promised today. In August 1991 we had a budget. Treasurer Dawkins allocated $200 million for labour market programs. He used these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the job market is not expected to dramatically improve in the short-term, the Government's labour market measures will ensure that, when the recovery comes and employment begins to grow, the unemployed will have the skills and training necessary to get back to work.</PARA>
<PARA>That was 3 1/2 years ago. That could be said today. Half the speakers on the other side of the House are going to get up and say that, but we have heard it all before. In the budget of 1991 Treasurer Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are going to see a small fall in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not see a small fall in unemployment. It went from 9.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent. I must say that I missed budget 1990. Treasurer Keating then said that the economy had `paused for breath'. I would not want to be under him as a doctor. He said, `We can expect unemployment to rise a little.' The government predicted 7.5 per cent; it hit 9.5 per cent the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on, but the one that has to be mentioned is One Nation, in February 1992. It was going to bring about a significant reduction in total unemployment. It was going to have investment going gang busters; $13 billion worth of projects. It had pooled development funds, which half the speakers on the other side of the House are going to talk about today. We never saw the $13 billion worth of investment. Unemployment went up to 10.7 per cent and the pooled development funds the government is having a third go at getting right this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We genuinely will support any assistance to help long-term unemployed Australians; that is important for this country. But we will not be conned by yet another promise or by any more overblown rhetoric, because it is cruel to raise expectations when one knows one cannot meet them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's contribution in this House today has been so disappointing. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) came into the House and said that unemployment is a really important problem, but the coalition is not going to do anything about it. The coalition does not have any current proposals. Fightback is dead. Those opposite have no proposals to attack the problem of long-term unemployment or to get the economy growing strongly. What is the opposition's policy when it comes to the young unemployed? What is the opposition's policy when it comes to carers of children in the home who have unemployed spouses? What is the opposition's policy when it comes to training, vocational training and so on? Nothing. We have nothing from the opposition to indicate how it would deal with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government will deal with these problems because it has a commitment to government intervention to solve the problem of long-term unemployment. We will do that in two ways: by getting the economy growing strongly and by bringing in the job compact to break the cycle of long-term unemployment. This leads me to the reason why the opposition's contribution has been so disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think about the opposition's policy, we really have to go back to Fightback because there is currently no policy that the opposition admits to. If we are going to have a constructive debate about the economic future of this country and about how we are going to create jobs for this country, we should spend a few minutes looking at what the opposition has had to say. The conclusion of Fightback states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal and National Parties are proud of this program and confident of its success . . . It is, we believe, irrefutable.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Fightback say about unemployment? Fightback said that labour market programs should be abolished. Fightback said that the unemployed should not continue to receive unemployment benefits after nine months. That is what the opposition wanted to do, simultaneously bringing in a 15 per cent GST on all the goods and services in our community, which would redistribute income from middle and low income earners to the well to do. That is what the opposition has had to say about a policy of economic growth and about how we create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Opposition dropped the GST shortly after the election. He went public and said, `Of course we are dropping the GST, but we are not dropping other elements of Fightback.' On 30 November, the Leader of the Opposition told Kerry O'Brien on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Hewson's still committed to the basic sense and direction of the policies we took to the last election&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when you say the principles and the directions of Fightback still prevail, what are the principles of Fightback that still prevail?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we stand by the need to cut government expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>Kerry O'Brien probed him a bit further and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Massively?</PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well massively is your word.</PARA>
<PARA>He later said that what he wants is cuts to government expenditure so that we get `a smaller and more efficient and more responsive public sector'. As recently as November last year, the opposition was committed to very substantial cuts in public expenditure. What would that mean for the unemployed? It would have to mean that things like unemployment benefits would be terminated after nine months, as proposed in Fightback, and that we could not have massive expenditure of billions of dollars on labour market programs, the type of which are proposed in the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to go a bit further to examine the opposition's statements on this question. I am pleased that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has entered the chamber. What has been his contribution to this debate? He has said that if we as a nation want to grow, we should adopt Asian levels of taxation. What would it mean if we were to do that? If we were to, say, move to the Korean model, it would require a cut in revenue of something like $33 billion. What would a cut in revenue of $33 billion mean for jobs and for government programs? It would mean the abolition of all the programs for labour and employment, plus education, plus health, plus industry assistance and most of the other areas in our program budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition clearly stands for massive cuts in public expenditure. When the opposition comes into this House and criticises the government for having a balanced program to generate growth through industry policy and for having labour market programs to make our work force more adaptive and productive, it really has not got a feather to fly with. There is no alternative economic policy emerging from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition says that we cannot spend money on labour market programs. We ask the opposition, `What is your solution? You do not believe in labour market programs. You are going to cut unemployment benefits after nine months. You do not believe in targeting to industry. What do you believe in?' The opposition says, `We believe in cuts to real wages. We believe in abolishing the industrial relations safety net, abolishing the award safety net and cutting real wages.'</PARA>

He said we would have to cut wages to the tune of 30 per cent. What would that mean to the average wage earner in this community? It would mean a cut in average weekly earnings in the order of $10,000. The economic program put forward by the opposition is very little different to what was in Fightback at the time of the last election, except the opposition will not call it Fightback any more. But it is still committed to massive cuts in public expenditure and it is still committed to the low wage route. It wants to take this country down the low wage, low skill, low service, no safety net Asian route. The debate in this country over the next few months will focus on what alternative the opposition is putting forward to this government's policy of growth plus. The opposition's alternative is the low wage, low productivity, no government safety net alternative. That is not really an alternative at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition really admires those Asian countries and if it wants us to adopt Asian levels of taxation, why is it not honest enough to tell the electorate?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 11 years, who has presided over high unemployment? It has been the Labor Party. Who deliberately engineered a recession and put one million Australians out of work? It was people like the honourable member for Lilley, who went around Queensland and other parts of Australia with his colleagues boasting about the record of the Labor Party and oozing compassion from every pore. Yet these are the people who put one million Australians out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is simply sickening. It keeps running this line that somehow it is the political party of compassion. A look at the figures on average weekly earnings over the last 11 years of this Labor government shows that 10 per cent of the lowest income Australians have suffered a fall in their real take-home pay in that period. In other words, the Labor Party, which professes to be the friend of low income Australians, is the party that has reduced the living standards of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at question time show that it is obvious he has not read the text of this white paper. As a result of this white paper, living standards of the unemployed who earn less than $100 per week will be reduced. It says it in black and white. There is even a table, which the Labor Party has obviously never looked at, illustrating how it plans to reduce the living standards of the poorest unemployed people in this country. This party talks about care and compassion, oozing all this unctuous nonsense from every pore. Its hypocrisy is really quite sickening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From our perspective, when coalition governments have been in power, we have aimed at quite simple things. We have aimed at not reducing wages or boasting that the accord has reduced wages&mdash;hooray!&mdash;or that the living standards of Australians, particularly lower income Australians, have fallen while we have been in power. We have had the ambition of increasing living standards. When we have been in government, we have achieved that. We have also aimed at achieving high rates of economic growth. In the main, when we have been in government, we have achieved that. The Labor Party always quotes the 1982-83 recession, which was a global recession, but it apparently never bothers to quote all of the many years when coalition governments in this country built up living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have heard the Prime Minister say over and again&mdash;he was reported as saying this in the caucus&mdash;that this white paper is a Labor document. It is. It is a defeatist document. It is an apology for a policy from a party that has put one million Australians out of work. It is defeatist, unlike the work of Ben Chifley. He decided to introduce a white paper when he first became the Prime Minister, not years and years after he had been in power. The likes of Ben Chifley aimed to eliminate unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But members of today's Labor Party say, `By the year 2000 we hope that only 500,000 people will be out of work.' I do not suppose they think that matters. I suppose they think those people are just 500,000 statistics. It just does not matter. Those opposite talk about compassion when it suits them, such as when they are out in Werriwa or somewhere talking to a group of Labor hacks and trade union officials in some Labor Party branch meeting, and ooze all this compassion, but they do not care that 500,000 people will be out of work by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party does not care about people. The honourable member for Lilley has a gutter mouth. At a doorstop interview this morning, he decided that all people who work in financial markets, one of the growth service industries in Australia, are yuppies and ghastly, uncompassionate, cruel, wicked and nasty people. What sort of person takes that point of view about fellow Australians? Most of us have at least a more reasonable view of our fellow country men and women. But not those in the Labor Party. By the year 2000, they will leave 500,000 people out of work, and they call that an achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This white paper is also a Labor document because it contains the old tax and spend formula. If the Labor Party sees a problem, it throws money at it. It happened in South Australia. Mr Bannon was in power there for years. He saw problems, and he had grand plans and schemes. Masses of money were shovelled out, and the state went broke. It happened in Western Australia with the current Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) and her various predecessors, such as Mr Dowding and Mr Burke or whoever. It happened in New South Wales and, par excellence, it happened in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always the same formula.

But the government cannot understand business investment; it is antipathetic to people who invest. It hates fund managers and people who invest. The government wants the Labor Party to spend taxpayers' money and solve the problem that way. It just will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shortly after the 1993 election, while honourable members opposite were in the spotlight, like rabbits, handcuffed to Fightback, together with some of my colleagues, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Sawford) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan), I was a member of the government's caucus employment task force. We embarked upon work to present a submission to the expert committee on the green paper, which is headed by Dr Michael Keating, the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It was our task to present a submission on what we regard as Australia's most pressing economic and social problem, long-term unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move to some of the items in our consideration, I think it is worth reminding the House what honourable members opposite stand for when they remain handcuffed to Fightback. At the moment we are not quite sure whether the key has been turned in the handcuff and the handcuff has fallen off or it is about to be slammed shut. In Fightback mark I, the attitude of honourable members opposite to long-term unemployment was that after nine months people were to be tipped off the dole. In Fightback mark II, when they became very wishy-washy, responding to opinion polls, when we looked at the fine detail we saw that they were committed to reducing outlays in spending on unemployed people by $800 million. In addition to that, we have their Jobsback package, which of course is simply a code for slashing wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very amused to see the honourable member for Bennelong, little Johnny Howard, traipse up to the front of the House the other day with his 1955 white picket fence firmly clutched under one arm and his copy of Jobsback clutched under the other. He said, `They're taking up our training wage. Our training wage is their training wage.' That is not true. The training wage in Jobsback was not a training wage at all. It contained no requirement or provision for training; it was simply a device to do what those opposite want to do. Their solution to any economic problem, their solution to unemployment, is to slash wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The solution of the caucus employment task force that I was a member of was fundamentally based on the following premise and policy: the solution to long-term unemployment was a growth-plus solution. In other words, economic growth by itself was not sufficient to take up the pool of long-term unemployed; we needed to maximise economic growth, but we also needed to take special steps and special measures to ensure that in the course of economic recovery long-term unemployed people were taken up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the honourable member for Port Adelaide has dealt with many of the measures that we could place under the `plus' heading. They include the job compact, the training wage, the removal of disincentives to work through our changes to social security and the parenting allowance, case management by the CES and private organisations, and voluntary or community work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that I want to concentrate on in the limited time available to me this evening is the growth area. It is important that we maximise economic growth. Let us look at the sorts of measures and steps that the government has been taking to maximise economic growth and to ensure that we are on a path to sustainable growth. I then want to turn to some of the measures we have taken in the industry policy area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In table 2.1 on page 19 of the white paper, the measures for growth and the sound basis for growth in the future are listed. I want to refer to some of them for the benefit of honourable members opposite. The white paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The economy is growing strongly&mdash;around 4 per cent through 1993&mdash;under the stimulus of the lowest interest rates in two decades, and the lowest inflation rates in three decades</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-interest rates on long term Government bonds are currently approaching 8 1/2 per cent, compared with around 13 1/2 per cent during the investment boom of the late 1980s</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">-the increase in the CPI over the year to the March quarter was 1.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth adding that we also have the lowest rate of industrial disputation in this country for over 30 years. The white paper goes on to refer to low inflation, our increased productivity, the corporate profit share being at a near all-time high, business confidence in manufacturing being at the highest level for more than 30 years, and world economic growth&mdash;particularly growth in east Asia&mdash;supporting further strong growth in our exports. Honourable members would be aware that currently one-third of our exports goes to these markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look further in the white paper, we see references to those things that the government's policy has ensured have occurred in the last decade, such as higher productivity, introduction of enterprise bargaining, and our accord commitment with the ACTU to ensure that wages outcomes are consistent with an inflation rate comparable to that of our major trading partners. We also see reference to the incentives for investment and the changes that we have made to the tax system, which include dividend imputation, accelerated and expanded depreciation, and a corporate tax rate reduced from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. Of course, at the last election those opposite wanted to jack up the corporate rate from 39 to 45, plus a 15 per cent GST. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now refer to exports and industry policy. At table 3.3 on page 55 of the white paper we see reference to the substantial improvements that the government policy has made to our export performance. Services exports have sustained real growth rates of over eight per cent, on average, from 1983 to 1993. Our export propensity in manufacturing rose from 14 per cent to 24 per cent between 1982-83 and 1992-93. Our exports of elaborately transformed manufactured goods have grown at an annual rate of 17.3 per cent from 1984 to 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the area of exports, which of course is a direct result of our industry policy, to which I now want to refer. I was very amused to see a reference in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) lamenting the fact that there was nothing new on industry policy in this statement. Let me refer briefly to some of the initiatives in industry policy in the statement. I compliment the Minister for Industry (Senator Cook) on the fine work he has done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initiatives in the industry policy area include improved access to finance for small and medium sized enterprises, substantial improvement in research and development of a 150 per cent tax concession, major improvements in the prospect of small and medium sized enterprises commercialising good ideas, removal of oncosts and administrative burdens from small and medium sized enterprises by the removal of the training levy, improvements in government purchasing, and further facilitation of export and trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to see what the Liberal Party has had to say about industry policy. I refer the House to comments made by the President of the Liberal Party, as reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 5 January 1994 under the heading `Lib president rejects economic rationalism,' which was taken as a direct rebuff of the Leader of the Opposition's policies. He is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"To be blunt, we would not be seeing the present growth in manufactured exports if the Federal Government had butted out of its responsibility for the development of industry policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Industries in which this is evident are the car industry, computer exports, exports of hardware and systems in the telecommunications area and the chemical industry."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"None of these things could have happened if we'd just `left it to the market'.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is precisely what those opposite want to do. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on the following day, 6 January, in a further story, reported by Bernard Lagan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, the comment goes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Staley surprised many Liberals on Tuesday when he said at the Young Liberals' Sydney conference that he supported much of the Government's industry policy and called for his own party to adopt similar policies.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague from Western Australia the member for Bunbury, the shadow spokesman for industry, is reported in that same piece as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I think what Tony Staley was saying was that the Government had been `you beaut' in industry policy. . . </PARA>
<PARA>Absolutely! Then we have the coup de grace. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> during the same period, Mr Staley is reported as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said the present growth in manufactured exports would not have happened if the Federal Government had not accepted responsibility for development of industry policy in areas like cars, computers, telecommunications and the chemical industry. There was a need for government to encourage industry in research, development, innovation and exporting.</PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the industry policy section of the white paper envisages, and it is precisely what those opposite would oppose. The white paper reflects this government's ambition, and the ambition of those on this side, to ensure that Australia becomes a society and an economy which has high growth, high employment, low inflation, high productivity and high wages. This stands in stark contrast to those opposite, who say that the approach we should take in terms of long-term unemployment is either to do nothing or to present the solution to all our problems as the slashing of wages. We on this side say that we can and will achieve a society in Australia where long-term unemployed people share in the benefits of the economic recovery and where in the next decade we can maintain a high growth, high productivity and high wage society. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is highly appropriate because the subject I am going to very briefly talk about this evening is a topic which arose in Queensland and in fact came from a Labor representative. I do not very often have occasion to stand in this House and praise a public representative of the Labor Party; however, I am going to do that tonight. The person I am referring to is Councillor Paul Tully, who is the only Labor councillor in the Ipswich City Council. The Ipswich City Council was formerly overwhelmingly a Labor council but, with the exception of Alderman Tully, all the ALP councillors on the Ipswich City Council lost their positions in the local government elections on 24 March this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to say that it is as a consequence of that enormous anti-Labor swing and the fact that perhaps Councillor Tully finds himself in a rather more vulnerable position than he might have imagined he was in prior to that election, nevertheless I am very pleased to see that he is now taking a very keen interest in the subject of the public perception of the dignity of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago, Councillor Tully raised an objection with Queensland Rail about a billboard that I believe appears at one of its railway stations. It is an advertisement for women's underwear. It is a picture of a woman from about the armpits to the waist wearing only a brassiere, and the caption is `making mountains of molehills'. Councillor Tully objected to Queensland Rail accepting payment for advertisements of this nature on the grounds that it really does demean the dignity of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been very interested to follow the debate&mdash;I have followed it silently until now&mdash;that has ensued. I have read letters on the subject to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the newspaper that the Parliamentary Library unfortunately does not think too much of&mdash;and other newspapers that are available to me, and I have listened to talkback radio on the subject. It has been very interesting. I will give you a very rough breakdown, Mr Speaker, of the public reaction. Unanimously, men have disagreed with Alderman Tully, and they have used a variety of terms in their disagreement. Women's views have been split but, on the whole, the great majority of women have supported him. On the radio talkback programs on this subject that I have heard&mdash;so far as one can discern age from someone's voice&mdash;it always sounds very much to me as though it is younger women who say they do not think he should have raised this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been interested to hear the comments of those who have disagreed with Alderman Tully, particularly men who have disagreed with his views, because I was looking to anticipate a couple. I was waiting to hear the term `politically correct'. I was waiting to hear people say, `Oh, he is only saying this because it is politically correct.' `Politically correct' seems to have become the latest term of abuse for people who raise issues in relation to women. Once upon a time, the terms used in this particular topic that Alderman Tully has raised would have been `Mother Grundy' or `blue nose'; all those terms of abuse that women have had to put up with for years when they have raised objection to the public demeaning of women's dignity by advertisements such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a place for these sorts of advertisements. I would not mind them in a women's magazine or even in a newspaper lingerie advertisment. I would not mind them in their proper context but I, along with Alderman Tully&mdash;and I know many women of all ages would agree&mdash;object to this sort of advertising in a very public place such as a railway station. I am therefore very pleased to get up publicly as a Liberal and say that I agree with the Labor councillor from Ipswich. All strength to his arm. I hope he keeps at it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to speak very briefly tonight. I have been thinking about this for a long time since we changed the hours in this place and I must place publicly on record my total opposition to this 8.00 o'clock finish. I know the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) will not agree with me, but I think it is an extraordinary waste of this parliament's time for us not to sit and I think it is an extraordinary waste of members' time. There are very few members&mdash;in fact, I can think of only two and they are the Canberra based members&mdash;who do not live outside the Canberra region. That means that the rest of us are here&mdash;not under sufferance but as part of a job&mdash;and my view is that there is absolutely no reason why we could not be sitting until 10.00, 10.30 or 11.00 o'clock at night, even until 10.00 o'clock with a half hour adjournment debate and then finishing at 10.30 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of reasons why I would prefer this. My understanding is that staff losses have been involved in the catering section of this place, and I am deeply concerned about that. In many cases, that has been young people, people who are studying and people with part-time work. I believe other staff have lost hours and are losing income. That is one important part of my objection. I also believe that the culture of this place is changing and I am extremely concerned about that. I think it is not changing for the better, but for the worse. It might be all very well for the eating houses around Canberra; they might be quite happy with the 8.00 o'clock finish, but I think the culture is changing to the extent that the relevance of this place is diminishing and diminishing very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation now where it is virtually impossible to catch up with anyone in the dining room. As you know, Mr Speaker, it is bad enough trying to catch up with people in this place anyway, but now we have effectively lost the dining  room facility. Very few people are eating there; they are wandering off at 8.00 o'clock at night, disappearing into the Canberra night, never to be seen again. There is just not that chance for any interaction between members of the same side but, I think equally importantly, between members from opposite sides of politics. The great thing about the dining room was that there was an opportunity to speak to colleagues on the other side of the political fence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I implore the House to review this. I think that we have made an absolutely dreadful mistake. There are some members who, like me, do not leave here at 8.00 o'clock and stay through until 10.30 or 11.00 and, quite frank</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a proportion of Gross Domestic Product, health expenditure has been relatively stable over the last decade ranging from 7.7 to 8.6 per cent, and averaging 7.9 per cent, around the average for countries belonging to the Organisation of Economic and Co-operative Development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare considered that the rise to 8.6 per cent in 1991-92 did not reflect an acceleration in health costs. Rather it reflected the impact of the recession on GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Health expenditure has been growing at an average annual rate of about 10.4 per cent in current prices, or 3.9 per cent at constant prices, comparable with population growth and rates of growth in GDP over this period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92, total health expenditure was $33.2 billion, or $1,904 per person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most Australian households spend very little of their after tax income on basic health care. For example, nearly half make no payment and about 75 per cent spend less than $4 per week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety nets are in place to protect individuals and families from unnecessarily high out-of-pocket expenses, and the socially disadvantaged are provided access to a range of allied health services such as dental care free of charge or at little out-of-pocket cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth involvement in medical costs is mainly in the areas of the Medicare benefits arrangements and grants to the States and Territories for access to public hospitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in the level of Medicare expenditure are a product of:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the ageing population of Australia, which is significant because a comparatively high proportion of the health budget is spent on older people;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">increases in the number of doctors billing under Medicare and the stimulus this provides for additional services;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">cost shifting and changes in treatment regimes (for example, ulcer drugs rather than surgery);</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">new and expensive technologies and rapid growth in their use;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the increasing range of services subsidised by the Schedule; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">patient expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's health policy and reform agenda is already acting to constrain medical costs through a combination of strategies, including macro-level cost controls and structural changes and incentives to improve the micro-economic efficiency of the health care system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure restraint has been applied to public provision of health services, largely through the capping of public hospital budgets. To a lesser extent cost containment in private provision is exercised through the monopsonistic power of the Government's Medical and Pharmaceutical Benefits Schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific strategies adopted include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">providing every Australian citizen with an entitlement to hospital treatment at no charge as a Medicare patient;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ensuring that Medicare Benefits Schedule fees are appropriate by means of the service and pricing review process of the medical insurance component of Medicare;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">maintaining the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing, pricing and authority processes;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">restructuring the way general practice is organised and financed;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">developing casemix based information systems in the public hospital system to improve efficiency in management and resource allocation;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">providing incentives to develop efficient alternatives to acute hospital care such as early discharge programs and post-acute and palliative care to reduce admissions and bed-day use; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">developing research and peer review processes to establish best practice guidelines to assist the medical profession to make cost effective clinical decisions taking account of the needs of patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bulk billing also serves to moderate increases in doctors' fees by encouraging price competition:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in the December quarter 1993, over 67 per cent of Medicare services were direct billed. That is to say, 67 per cent of Medicare services were provided at no direct cost to the consumer and the Government subsidy was the full cost of the service;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in the period 1984-85 to 1992-93, the level of direct billing in Australia increased by 19.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of Medicare Benefits Schedule fees also serves to moderate increases in doctors' fees:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">in the December quarter 1993, 80 per cent of Medicare services were direct billed or patient billed at or below the Schedule fee;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schedule fee observance increased by 2.2 per cent between the December quarter 1993 and the December quarter 1992. This shows a continuing trend of increase in Schedule fee observance in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, while the Government sets the fees on which Medicare benefits are based, it has no direct power or authority to determine the fees charged by doctors in private practice, nor can it compel them to observe the Schedule fee for a particular service. Medical practitioners are therefore free to set their own values on their services and the actual fee charged is a matter between the doctor and the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A discussion paper containing proposals for the reform of private health insurance was released in December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, it is too early to make any definitive comment on how the reforms will eventually look.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition the Government has:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">adopted a policy in relation to high cost technology such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">restructured pathology in co-operation with the profession; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">agreed with State and Territory governments to review outpatient services with the objective of having the focus placed on the provision of cost effective high quality care rather than on cost shifting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will continue to promote efficiency in the delivery, pricing and funding of health care, and at the same time, continue to seek to improve the quality and appropriateness of care and health outcomes for patients.</PARA>
