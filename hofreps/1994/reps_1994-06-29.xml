<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the amendments be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA>We are now considering a number of amendments that have been made in the Senate to the Australian Capital Territory Government Service (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1994. Nearly all of these amendments are government amendments. I remind the House that, during the process of negotiation with the ACT government and the trade union movement, I indicated that I would be available to make amendments to the bill, after any negotiations, as it passed through the chambers. That has occurred. We are pleased to propose some amendments to the bill as a result of the negotiations and, indeed, the opposition has proposed an amendment which we did not oppose in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the amendments which are mainly of a minor and technical nature: firstly, we seek to insert a time frame of 18 months within which proclamation of the act must occur. This is to accommodate comments made on the bill by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Secondly, we seek to provide a mechanism for access back to the Australian Public Service for officers who are to become members of the separate service of the ACT on transfer day without the need for a merit test. This mechanism is currently available to officers of the service to enable them to move within the service through the operation of section 50 of the Public Service Act. I might add, in response to some of Senator Hill's comments on the radio this morning, that the opposition moved an amendment which extends access to this provision from 12 months to two years. I had suggested that we would accept the two years but Senator Hill insisted on moving that amendment, which is fine. However, I think it should be placed on the public record that both sides agree that a two-year transitional provision is a reasonable thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we seek to make provision for access by the ACT Government Service to the Merit Protection Review Agency on a user pays basis. We made two amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 to provide the capacity for the ACT Legislative Assembly to disallow determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal made in relation to ACT officers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, we wish to provide that the relevant provisions of the Australian Capital Territory Self-Government (Consequential Provisions) Act 1988 commence immediately after the commencement of this bill. This amendment avoids the need for separate proclamation action that would have to be coordinated with the proclamation of this bill. A further two amendments have been included which make provision for the transfer of recreation leave credits for officers appointed to the APS from the ACT service and for officers appointed to the ACT from the Australian Public Service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will not be opposing any of these amendments, as they have been the subject of agreement, in most cases, and discussion in another place.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very briefly take the opportunity of joining the Special Minister of State (Mr Johns) in wishing the new public service establishment in the ACT good fortune and success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There remains in this parliament a variety of views about what the appropriate method of management of the affairs of the ACT ought to be. I remain an unredeemed supporter of the municipality principle, but I accept that those who dictate these matters have other views. Those other views having prevailed, obviously the system has to be run properly. If you are going to have what you have now, having a separate public service makes a degree of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel constrained to make two comments. I have not been able to find in any of the utterances of government ministers on the establishment of this public service anything to suggest that the odious practice which exists in the Commonwealth Public Service of giving preference to trade unionist will not be carried forward into the ACT public service. I would like some kind of guarantee from the minister that I am mistaken in that belief that there exists a significant degree of preference for trade unionists in the Commonwealth Public Service. That continues to be a source of criticism by the opposition and by many people in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, I was very interested yesterday&mdash;or was it the day before?&mdash;to hear the minister for health proudly proclaiming that a public opinion survey said that 85 per cent of the Australian community supported Medicare. Members of the opposition were enjoined, on the basis of that, to sing hallelujah and praise to Medicare. I remind the House that public opinion surveys consistently show that over 80 per cent of Australians oppose compulsory unionism and preference for trade unionists, including an almost equal equivalent percentage of trade unionists themselves. If we apply the Medicare principle, I invite you to sing hallelujahs in favour of voluntary unionism and the end of preference in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that point having been made, there will be another forum for discussion of such matters as the minister's Orwellian guidelines for workplace harassment which have been published recently. They really take the disease of political correctness in this country to demented lengths. The idea that a government bureaucracy should lay down the way in which you invade or not invade the work space of a colleague and, in effect, whom you should invite to your happy hour is quite an interesting proposition and one that in another environment I think the minister was showing very welcome signs of rejecting. Perhaps that debate will give him the opportunity of illuminating us a bit more on the statement he made which attracted so much publicity about a week ago. I thought he was getting very close to the mark with a lot of things, but that is for another debate. </PARA>

That is usually through trade unions. So I reject any notion that there is some sort of compulsion to operate through trade unions or that some preference is given by the Commonwealth to workers who are trade unionists. What there is is an encouragement. It is a sensible thing to join a trade union.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate relates to the government's white paper on employment entitled Working Nation. I am reminded at the outset that yesterday in question time the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was in a Shakespearian mode and was quoting lines from Macbeth. At the time, I thought about what he had to say and about this paper. I thought there was a much more apt quotation from Shakespeare, one which summed up not only the comments of the Treasurer yesterday but also the whole approach of this government to the problem of unemployment and the entire approach of the so-called Working Nation document. The line I refer to is the one where Shakespeare talks about a great deal of sound and fury signifying nothing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in this document and in the approach which the government has taken is yet another illustration of government by illusion. This government issued a document some time ago entitled One Nation but it has done more than any other government in the history of this federation to create two nations. The gap between the rich and the poor in this country has grown considerably over the last decade. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) comes into this place at question time and seeks to blame the Fraser government, the Menzies government. If he were to go on for long enough, he would probably blame Lord Melbourne, Lord Bruce, Alfred Deakin or Governor Macquarie. No matter how often he comes in here and says, `They are not our problems; they are the problems of someone in past,' we know that the reality is that this situation has occurred as a result of this government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one statistic that indicates the size of the problem that this government is faced with, it is that a decade ago the top one per cent of earners in Australia earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent. Today, the top one per cent earn as much as the bottom 21 per cent. The gap between the rich and the poor in this country under this government and under the Prime Minister who sits opposite has risen by that amount. Yet the Prime Minister has the cheek to come into this place and say to the Australian people, `This is one nation.' The reality is that Australia is two nations. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HK5">Mr ANDREWS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my learned colleague says, `So much for the social justice.' When we look at this document we find that once again we have government by illusion. This document is entitled Working Nation. We are coming out of the worst recession this country has had in 60 years. When we are working for officially a million unemployed Australians and probably another million as well who are not officially recorded, the concept of working is once again an illusion. The government is led by an arrogant Prime Minister who says that this document is about a working nation. It is no more about a working nation than the previous document was about one nation. Once again it illustrates that the government at the present time is concerned about illusion and perception.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will remember what the Prime Minister said on the eve of the last election in a secretly taped conversation with some of his staff members and close confidantes in a restaurant in Sydney. He said, `We've been weaving a giant tale', creating an illusion and a perception for the Australian people to believe that we are doing something to bring the nation together and put people back into work. The reality is that that is simply not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation document talks about expending $6.5 billion but, when we break that figure down and look at what is actually being spent each year, we find that in this first year about $1.3 billion is being spent, rising to about $1.5 billion in the second year. Whether the $6.5 billion is ever spent still remains to be seen. It could well be like the tax cuts that we were promised which have been put on the never-never. Honourable members will remember the second round of tax cuts which were, in the words of the Prime Minister, l-a-w, law. Of course, we are not going to see the second round of those tax cuts. They are on the never-never. Who knows what will happen with the expenditure under this so-called Working Nation document?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I would like to briefly refer to two examples which illustrate this notion of a government which is concerned about pereception and illusion and which is not concerned about the real outcomes of policies. Let us take one simple example of its approach to family policy. The reality is that there is no comprehensive family policy in Australia that deals with enhancing families and that tries to affirm the commitment which the overwhelming majority of Australians aspire to and, even when they fail, seek out again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the parenting allowance, which was much vaunted by the government and which is mentioned in the Working Nation document. The so-called parenting allowance is largely an illusion. In the white paper, the government announced that it will provide a parenting allowance of up to $132.65 per week for families with only one parent employed. It sounds fine; it sounds great. It sounds like the sort of policy that one would seek to support. From what we are told, it is fine. But what are we not told about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not told that it will apply to only 118,000 Australians, of about two million Australian households, most of whom will receive far less than $133 per week. We are not told that an unemployed married couple on either jobstart or newstart currently receives a maximum of $265.30 per week. Under these proposals, each person will receive $132.65 per week. Two times $132.65 adds up to $265.30, which is the same amount that they would have received before as a married couple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, on the surface, it sounds fine. It sounds like a great initiative which is doing something for parents and families in this country. But, when we add up the figures, we see that in reality it is not making much of a substantial change at all. It will certainly advantage some in cases where there is unemployment in families. But, if we were to believe the rhetoric about this, we would think that it would result in large-scale changes for Australian families across the nation, but it does nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same thing can be said about the whole area of training and employment. When the green paper was released, there was at last some hope that there was a recognition of the problems that had occurred in training over the last decade. For example, the committee stated that vocational training had been neglected, that existing arrangements had a number of shortcomings and that there were a number of deficiencies in the current system. But, when one looks at the response in the white paper, one sees that it fails in most of the major areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper fails to provide anywhere near the number of apprenticeships necessary to replenish the skills of the Australian work force, particularly our Australian youth. What happened to apprenticeships over the last few years? In the three years between 1989-90 and 1991-92, the number of apprenticeships in this country fell from 62,000 to just over 38,000. That is an illustration of the lack of training being provided to the youth of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government says that it is doing something in the area of TAFE and vocational education and training which will improve the training standards. But when one looks closely at the figures for TAFE and for vocational education and training, no better picture is painted than this: participation rates in TAFE for students aged 17 to 24 years was the same in 1992 as it was in 1984. The total TAFE enrolments as a percentage of total enrolments by age actually declined in Australia between 1985 and 1991. As the federal government finally conceded last year, the number of 17- to 24-year-olds with trade qualifications had fallen by 11 per cent since 1983. So much for the great commitment to vocational education and training through TAFE. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at the Commonwealth's commitment to funding in this area, one sees that from 1983-84 onwards, funding dropped from over $400 million to just over $200 million. Yes, it has been increased in the last 12 months. But there was a period of some six or seven years where the Commonwealth neglected its commitment to vocational education and training, to the skills of our youth and to the opportunities of getting jobs, which is what this paper is meant to be about. The amount of funding went down, not up. Any efforts that are made now are basically trying to catch up on a situation which was allowed to deteriorate over that period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The paper does nothing to address the high dropout rates from TAFE and the Australian traineeship system. It concedes, for example, that the government has no reliable information on the literacy standards of school children, largely because teacher unions around the country have successfully blocked testing of children up until now. What is the case if parents in this country want to know how their children are getting on at school? I can speak from experience as I have three primary school age children; one has just started secondary school. I have the greatest admiration for the teachers in the schools which they attend. How can we as parents get some objective assessment of how our children are going in schools across the country? How do we know whether our children are performing as well as others in the class, except from the say-so of the teachers, and how do we know that that class is performing as well as a class in the school down the road? In any event, how do we know that the standards across the country are as good as we might expect in a country which is told that it has to be and does need to be internationally competitive? How do we know if we do not ask the questions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until recently, the suggestion that we might have some form of objective assessment of primary school age children in this country has met with delirious cries of outrage, largely emanating from teacher unions. It is simply not good enough. It is not good enough for parents, it is not good enough for the country, and it is selling short Australian school children who want the best opportunity and the best chances to get on with their life and to obtain skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If honourable members want an example of an assessment that skills have gone backwards, last year the professors of mathematics at both Melbourne and Monash universities said that the standard of first year mathematics students at those universities had gone backwards by one year over the space of the last three years. If those universities got their students, at the end of the first year, to the same standard in mathematics as students three years previously had been when they came to university, they thought they were doing a good job. Just recently, one of the senior academics from Monash University suggested that we need a preliminary year to tertiary education so that students can be brought up to the standard which they might be expected to achieve at university. Is that not an indication of the problem that we are facing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in this document is once again government by illusion, government by deception, government of creating the giant tale that the Prime Minister talks about. It reminds me of my daughter who creates fantasies and talks to herself when she plays with dolls. The problem here though is that what the Prime Minister and this government are playing around with is not dolls but real people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems to have lost the plot. It thinks that this is just a matter of creating the perception that things will be all right and people will believe it. The Treasurer yesterday was wont to quote Shakespeare, and I reminded the House earlier that a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing was perhaps more appropriate. In the case of the Prime Minister, again, he is a man of illusion, and perhaps another Shakespearian quote is relevant: `A poor player, that who struts and frets his hour upon the stage. And then is heard no more.' The Australian people will rejoice when that day comes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add my comments to the discussion on the Working Nation statement, which was presented, I think, on 4 May. The paper provides a comprehensive program to boost jobs growth, increase the skills formation in the work force and ensure the long-term unemployed are not left behind during the economic recovery. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) made much about alluding to the illusion in his discussion of what he saw as being policy outcomes from this government. Unfortunately, most of his spin was essentially quite negative. Even I would look forward to hearing some policies which might come from the opposition in a positive way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package is designed to meet both the social and economic needs of the nation, to get the whole community working towards that goal of securing jobs and to get the unemployed back to work. After all, it is the condition of the labour market which has driven the government to produce the white paper. I feel that there are imaginative policies and programs that are involved in this white paper. The paper builds on the information and the knowledge that the government already has through its previous and continued implementation of its labour market programs, which have been consistently attacked by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, during the last election in my electorate the campaign very much focused on some of the labour market programs. I am delighted that the electorate was aware of the good work that the labour market programs do for the north coast. Hence, I and my colleague the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) were returned. I have no doubt that those labour market programs, and the way people perceive them, benefit not only those people who are in the programs but also those people who benefit indirectly from them and the initiatives in place&mdash;the employers and other members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about the policy settings of the economy, and certainly they are in place for high economic and employment growth while maintaining low inflation. There has been much angst of late about interest rates, but I would suggest that we are capable of sustaining the high rates of economic growth&mdash;and the white paper certainly puts forward further reforms to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that if we are to have an efficient economy, an efficient society, it is imperative that even the barefaced economists, or the red-necked economists&mdash;or whatever other term I might like to use to describe some of the pragmatists and hard-headed economists&mdash;recognise that efficient use must be made of the labour pool which is available, and having 10 per cent of people stay or remain in unemployment is not one of those efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation is certainly about assisting the economy back into efficiency. It is more than being cool or cold and looking simply at the use of labour; it is about equity, it is about social justice and it is about assisting families and people to maintain their dignity and to contribute positively to society in their working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major areas that I find commendable within Working Nation is, as I mentioned, the way that it has picked up the good information and good work that have already been put in place with our labour market programs and the work that has been done to assist regions of Australia. Various commentators have felt that we have not done enough. Some have felt that we have not gone in the right direction. But I feel that the key elements of regional development are addressed through the white paper. I feel that these key elements are certainly going to assist the north coast as a typical regional area. I will come to that very shortly in a more deliberate sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the key points that will be of assistance to regions will be increasing financing options for business and regions. In other words, there will be the opening up of finance through the Commonwealth Development Bank and the reduction of the tax on PDFs from 25 to 15 per cent, which is very attractive to local investors. I will make more comments about the PDF scheme very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work in facilitating infrastructure development through the regional infrastructure fund of $70 million is a great impetus to regions within Australia. I feel that the comments on an $80 million grant for the best practice program simply speak for themselves; nearly all of them have been quite positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Austrade and the Ausindustry initiatives, which are designed to promote export activity, will be picked up. I know that they are already being picked up in my area. Austrade has already been of much assistance to a number of industries on the north coast. I look forward to assisting other industries in working with Ausindustry to expand the nature of their business. There are changes to the Department of Social Security system to improve program delivery so that looking for work, be it part-time or casual work, is attractive. Obviously, I will make further comments on the job compact very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has certainly created a framework that regional areas are able to adapt to their specific needs. I certainly have confidence in the ability, talent and skills that lie in the north coast and/or in any region. As a member of one or two government committees, including the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I have had the pleasure of visiting quite a few regions on inspections and inquiries. I have picked up the feeling that there is the ability, talent and the skills in many parts of Australia to capitalise on the regional development ideas in the white paper. I certainly know that that is so in my area of the north coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The strong and committed leadership is there. It is continuing to strive forward. We have given assistance to these organisations to enable them to capitalise on what is available. Regional development does not come just from the top down. As I have mentioned, the skills are there so that it can come from the bottom up. If possible, other regions can model themselves on the examples of the two regions in Working Nation. They indicate that there has to be a bottom up approach. Working Nation makes that feasible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite the structural unemployment problems, the far north coast region is growing. It is certainly one of the fastest growing regions in population terms in New South Wales and/or Australia. The region is very confident of its future. The best people to drive that regional development are certainly the local people and those investing locally and creating local jobs for the future of the region. Any notion of regional development involving vast amounts of government subsidies of one sort or other simply fall flat when those government subsidies are withdrawn. So it is imperative that the development come from within the region, recognising the strengths that are there and building on what is already in the region. That has already occurred in a number of regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the two that were mentioned in the Working Nation statement I pay tribute to the region of greater Taree, which has achieved that end on its own. It did not start just one or two years ago; it is one of those long-term plans which I think all regions have to take on board. It started 10 to 15 years ago, if not more, and from that slow, steady growth we now have a region which has quite a number of manufacturing jobs within that local economy. If there was ever an example I would point anyone to it is that area. I am also moving my own area towards that end very slowly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things do take a little time to put in place. It takes time for people to realise that they can make gains and where they can make gains. At times they go on the back foot a little when they find that they have made some mistakes, but you cannot go forward without making one or two mistakes. Nevertheless, I think the north coast area is quite capable of going forward. Moves are afoot, with a bit of assistance from  me, to establish and ascertain local support for the establishment of a pooled development fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago, Bronwyn Anderson and the Chamber of Manufactures located at Ballina attempted to run a seminar on attracting finance to a region. They found that it was very difficult. Nevertheless, some positive feedback came from that early attempt. I understand that they will be having a second seminar, having learned some lessons, to try to push that forward again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pooled development idea for the north coast has already been raised with NOREDO, the Northern Region Economic Development Organisation, at a meeting in Grafton last week. It also raised the idea at its meeting. I feel that, with the support of NOREDO and other local organisations, with what the Chamber of Manufactures was trying to do some time ago and with what we can achieve by taking up some of the ideas in the Working Nation paper, we will go a long way towards achieving a positive outcome for the north coast. I feel that the north coast is certainly ready to take up the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the positive feeling which is starting to develop amongst some of the regions, particularly the north coast. NOREDO was able to obtain a grant of some $40,000 for an area consultative committee to oversee some of the training and employment initiatives that are being put in place. As its name suggests, it is a diverse organisation. I commend the work of the chairman of that organisation, Dr Jim Gallagher. I also commend the good work of the north coast unions in supporting the employers and trainers in what they have to do to actually get people into these training positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might digress a little and mention that the north coast is one of the first areas to get its jobskills programs under way. Essentially it was done with the cooperation of the employers and the unions in terms of what was required to ensure that training in those jobskills positions was real and that it was something which provided the people with skills. I also want to give some examples of where these jobskills positions are and how they have progressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also mention the work of people such as Mark Jackson, who was one of the first people involved in the jobskills position. He now works for Greening Australia and now it has started to take people through the regional environment employment program, REEP. Essentially, that program was devised by Greening Australia. The north coast is benefiting at the moment from some 250 places provided through the LEAP jobskills program. It is going a long way towards assisting worthy environmental projects both in the catchment areas of the rivers and along the coast, particularly dune care work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I attended one of those dune care organisations just two or three weeks ago, at Shelly Beach near Ballina. The participants in the scheme were working with the local dune care group to improve the dunes along the coastline. That is not only improving their work skills but also assisting tourism growth around that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another project which I recently had the pleasure of seeing completed was at North Tumbulgum near Murwillumbah and at Bray Park where students in the program were restoring historic grave sites in a cemetery. It probably does not sound like a very exciting program, but the fact is that when they finished that program some three quarters of those people had actually got themselves into employment within a month. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Working Nation white paper on employment and growth is really an indictment of this Labor government, which stands guilty both of ignoring the increasing national problem of structural long-term unemployment and of worsening it by its unintelligent, sectarian policy responses. One has to draw this conclusion because, by the government's own admission, it will be the business sector, in particular the small and medium sized business sector, that will drive this economy out of the recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) set up the original working committee to produce the forerunner to the white paper, namely the green paper, we saw that the committee was formed of bureaucrats and academics. I recognise the tremendous input that academics and bureaucrats can have in looking at this nation's most serious problem; however, one would have thought that if, as the government stated, small business was going to play a very significant role in driving this country out of recession and driving the economic engine the government would have included in that working committee at least some people from industry and the commercial sector. But that was not the case. So I think this is a very cynical exercise. It is not about creating or providing jobs for people. It is simply about training or retraining people for jobs that simply do not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment has become a massive national cost burden and a human tragedy. Despite the economic upturn since the beginning of last year, the official unemployment rate stands at just under 10 per cent, or around 900,000 Australians, of whom 350,000 have been unemployed for more than 12 months. A recovery rate at the current four per cent each year sustained for the remainder of the decade will cut the unemployment rate to only seven per cent at best. To reduce it to five per cent requires an annual growth of between five per cent and six per cent, and that is clearly beyond Australia's possibility while this government remains in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 26 April, one of this government's own members, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), admitted that in addition to the almost one million people registered as jobless, another 750,000 Australians desire to work but stand outside the labour force. What is worrying more and more Australians and should worry this government is the fact that successive recessions punctuating periods of growth&mdash;perhaps we ought to be reversing this&mdash;leave Australia with a rising unemployment base. Should the policies of this government subject us to another recession, then we can anticipate a 14 per cent unemployment rate by the end of the century with more and more families in which no-one holds a full-time job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary to look beyond the bald unemployment rate because during the years of growth from 1983 to 1989, although 1.6 million jobs were created, the number of unemployed fell by only 300,000. We had a situation where out of every five jobs created three were taken up by growth of the working population, one by a new entrant to the labour force and one by a previously unemployed person. The pattern is a repeating one since December 1992, with 211,000 new jobs but a fall of only 44,000 in the total number of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1978, when unemployment exceeding seven per cent was seen as unacceptably high, the mean duration of unemployment was eight weeks. In 1993 it had risen to 33 weeks, and 40 per cent of the unemployed had been without a job for more than 12 months. It cannot be stressed enough that this is a tragedy not only for thousands of individuals who see themselves as permanently excluded from work and thereby socially marginalised, as well as materially deprived, but for Australian society, when a growing number of its citizens have no experience of the work ethic and can lack all sense of community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is alarming that of the three lowest income deciles in Australia very little income derives from wages or salaries. Among the poorest 20 per cent of Australians there are only 0.2 per cent employed people per household, compared with the national average of 1.2, and 2.5 among the richest 10 per cent. Even when we make allowance for aged pensioners, there are thousands of Australian children growing up in households where no-one in the household has a job. The extent of the problem can be seen in the attrition rates in some instances of subsidised employment with voluntary organisations, when applicants have been demoralised and the organisation finds that it has to act as a family support agency for these participants. More quantifiable is the total monetary cost of unemployment, estimated at between $16 billion and $25 billion by the committee on employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment benefits that cost 15 per cent of the federal education budget in 1974-75, then considered a very bad year for unemployment, compare with the equivalent of 82 per cent of the education budget in 1992-93. The only response that we get from this Labor government is more training and more subsidised jobs. The $1.3 billion spent on labour market programs and on a CES that in 1989 filled 30 per cent of job vacancies and now fills only 17 per cent is to be increased yet further. With spending up from $400 million in 1989, there are still 230,000 Australians who used labour market programs yet could not find work or training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Throw money at the problem and it will go away; train the long-term unemployed and the unskilled school leaver for jobs that do not exist or that will be taken up by those whose more skilled occupations have disappeared&mdash;these are the kinds of solutions that we are seeing from this white paper. All that we will ultimately have are the best trained unemployed and low paid workers in the Asia-Pacific region. We may also look forward to tinkering with the statistics so that the replacement of jobsearch by Austudy for those under 18 could conveniently remove 37,000 people from the unemployment statistics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly; we have been conned. Overseas experience shows that there is no ready excuse. Unemployment last year in the United States, despite a recession, was seven per cent, and it was only 2.5 per cent in Japan, which considers that it has serious problems. The productivity growth of Australia since 1983 has been the worst in the OECD, and investment is down to 19 per cent of GDP&mdash;the lowest figure for 40 years. The last people who should be blamed for this are either the wage earners of Australia, who have been working harder and longer for reduced real wages, or the wealth creators, who have been throttled by taxation and oncosts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Low productivity is all about a government that does nothing to encourage fuller utilisation of capital equipment, not grasping that shift work is preferable to unemployment and takes pressure off the existing work force and that does not worry unduly that such near neighbours as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia take less than two per cent of their imports from us. It is also a government that brutally adds to labour oncosts by its taxation and industrial policies so that worldwide growth in employment becomes certain to pass Australia by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has this Labor government ever stopped to think that if Australia attracted a mere 1.5 per cent of the 60 million jobs created worldwide each year then we would smash our unemployment problem? This government brags about training for non-existent jobs but has dragged its feet on micro-economic reform so that in 1992 our waterfront was still moving only 18.7 containers an hour, compared with 20.7 in New Zealand and 26.7 in the United States. According to the Business Council of Australia, in the same year only 24 per cent of the potential gains from transport reform had been realised. The 1993 Industry Commission report cited only 11 reforms by this government, compared with 271 reforms at the state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a government that cheerfully presides over a national savings rate of 18 per cent of national income, compared with 33 per cent in east Asian economies. This is a government that has added $38.7 billion to national dissaving in three budget deficits since it abandoned surpluses after 1991 and, on its own projections of supposed fiscal responsibility, will add another $28.4 billion to national deficits over the next three years. This is a government that has now amassed a $56 billion public debt, which the government's own 1994-95 budget projects will lift to $95 billion within two years. This is a government that squeezes the states to improve its own financial situation at their expense, as has been highlighted by one of its own members, the honourable member for Fraser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government is mocking the thousands of unemployed Australians by funding its vaunted training programs through a taxation regime that increases business costs and thus discourages job growth. It has been estimated by a study at Curtin University that 96 per cent of Australia's business enterprises spend more on compliance costs than they remit in taxation. This is clearly madness. Ninety per cent of employers paying the fringe benefits tax lose an additional 42 per cent in administration costs, and 64 per cent of such firms need to hire outside experts to administer the fringe benefits tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The superannuation guarantee charge costs the private sector more and more and is of scant benefit to low paid workers, despite the government's pathetic efforts, announced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) yesterday, to redress the legislation that has not delivered the benefits to those it claims to assist. This government refuses to assist the states to abolish payroll tax, yet the honourable member for Fraser vindicates the coalition argument of the last election by saying that abolition of this tax would create an additional 100,000 jobs. The training guarantee levy has continued to harass private enterprise through the iniquitous practice of using the tax system to impose regulation. Despite the scheme's failure, the government is so paralysed it can only provide legislation to this House to suspend this measure rather than to repeal it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity of the private sector to create jobs is steadily thwarted by regulation, with the amount of deregulated legislation, rules and disallowable instruments increasing along with the growth in unemployment. In 1982-83, 703 such measures were promulgated. In 1991-92, it had increased to 1,543 pieces of regulation, legislation or whatever, all impeding the growth and development of this nation's business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past decade has seen an extra 30,000 pages of new statutes. Whereas the entirety of federal legislation prior to 1973 could be contained in a metre of bound volumes, another metre is now added every few years. So much of this increases the regulatory environment for the business sector. Above all, this Labor government relies on a healthy and developing economy to deliver job growth but at every stage it has been prepared to sacrifice growth when it conflicts with the supreme vested interests of the ACTU. No less a person than Anna Booth of the ACTU boasted on 20 April that, although private sector unionisation might well fall below 20 per cent, the ACTU would retain its position of dominance by imposing new work conditions on the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is an active partner in a process whereby a minority organisation has its ideology imposed upon the great majority of employees who choose not to support it, and draws its strength from a protected public sector. Small business that is 95 per cent non-unionised is the victim of this destructive process. This cosy partnership may have held down real wages since 1983 but it has only added to labour on-costs and hampered Australia's ability to increase its productivity. Centralised wage fixation continues to impose its dead hand, and the boast of this government as to 1,600 enterprise agreements looks hollow when we consider that there are 904,249 Australian business enterprises in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small businesses that now employ 54 per cent of private sector non-agricultural employees have, thanks to the subservience of this government to the ACTU, lost much of their legislative protection from secondary boycotts and are all the more vulnerable to anti-employment union pressure. This government has joined 17 nations, notably the subsistence economies of Malawi and Zaire, in adopting ILO conventions on the dismissal of workers and has used an international convention to impose upon Australian business and people a process whereby the dismissal of unproductive workers will become more difficult and more expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet another ALP-ACTU sweetheart deal ignores the fact that fewer businesses will now be prepared to take the risk of hiring new permanent staff. The interests of the jobless are being sacrificed to those of existing and often less competent employees. Until we have a government prepared to uphold the interests of job creators and of jobless Australians against this selfish and increasingly unrepresentative power structure, all the training programs and subsidised employment schemes in the world will do nothing but plough the sands.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This morning we are discussing the white paper entitled Working Nation which sets out the blueprint for this government's economic, industrial and investment policies for the next decade. In so many ways, what we do for the remainder of this decade will determine what we can do as a nation for the next century. The challenge for the government today is to put in place policies that will foster sustained growth and help create jobs for all Australians. In some instances, particularly with the long-term unemployed, that requires direct involvement by the  government. The white paper Working Nation has set out specific measures to this end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government does not want to have two Australian societies&mdash;the haves and the have nots. We want one Australian community, we want one nation, working together for the same ends. Basically, it is the Australian people and the firms they work who hold the key to our future economic success and prosperity. The government can do many things to set up the economy for strong growth but, ultimately, it is the success of Australian firms that will determine our living standards in the 21st century. The success of Australian firms will determine whether we become two societies or remain one community. The government has a role to play, but in industry policy it is a facilitating role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to concentrate my comments this morning on the industry policy initiatives and investment policies contained in Working Nation. Industry policy is about building competitive firms and a competitive environment in which these firms can flourish. The two goals of the industry policy contained in Working Nation are: building competitive firms and building a competitive environment in which these firms can flourish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must lift performance in all areas of our economy. We need to focus on the factors critical to success in the global marketplace. We need to focus on innovation, uptake of new technology and business improvement, backed up with decisive leadership and a strong export push, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The emphasis in all of this is not on particular industries; it is on competitive enterprises in every sector of the economy. Innovation is the key to economic growth. At an enterprise level, innovation enhances a firm's competitiveness and its potential for growth. In the most successful firms, innovation touches upon every aspect of operations. For some firms, however, especially the smaller ones, there are impediments to innovation. Accordingly, the government will spend almost $120 million on promoting innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will ease the eligibility requirements for the 150 per cent taxation concession for research and development. Thresholds will be reduced to allow greater access for small and medium sized companies. We will also provide a support scheme for specific early commercialisation in small, high technology firms. While research and development can deliver substantial returns, the benefits of technology diffusion can be twice as large. Yet most Australian firms are three to eight years behind their international competitors in technology uptake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Working Nation statement, the government introduced a number of initiatives designed to boost enterprise competitiveness by accelerating the uptake of technology, particularly in small to medium sized companies. These initiatives include the formation of a national technology access and diffusion network&mdash;a network which will strengthen the links between business users, science agencies, and research and technology centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's scientific base is a rich source of innovation for the development of new products and processes. The government will continue to nurture science conducted in the public interest. We want to see more of the nation's research dollar find its way into commercially viable outcomes. The government will increase the base funding for our three key scientific institutions and will establish a national research facilities program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Australia is to be a vital exporting nation, the relationships between firms, customers and suppliers must be strong. The past isolation of Australian industry behind the protectionist wall prevented many of these critical linkages developing. Accordingly, the government has announced in the Working Nation statement that it will provide additional funding through the National Industry Extension Service to support the creation of networks that improve competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful transition to a global marketplace also required leadership from government and industry, and individual firms. Last year the McKinsey emerging exporters study found that corporate leadership was the most important determinant of export success. It has been the vision of firm leaders, and their strong commitment to realise that vision, that has generated much of our recent trade growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted that a number of companies in my electorate of Moreton were favourably mentioned in the McKinsey report. In particular, I mention three firms: Cigweld; Thompsons, Kelly and Lewis Ltd; and Tubemakers of Australia. Those three companies based in Coopers Plains in my electorate received a special mention in the report because they have been very active in driving to gain overseas export markets. They prove that, with vision, leadership and innovation, there are no boundaries Australian firms cannot explore. There are no limitations on where we can go to find new export markets and to earn valuable export dollars for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key points in the McKinsey report was that around 15,000 firms are potential exporters which have yet to get their act together. To encourage them on their export drive, the government will provide more than $100 million over four years to implement a major outreach program targeted at these potential exports. If firms are to innovate, take up new technology and explore new markets, they need access to finance on reasonable terms and conditions. The government is undertaking a wide range of initiatives to improve small business access to both debt and equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concessional tax rate for pooled development funds will be reduced from 25 to 15 per cent for income derived from investments in small to medium size enterprises. The restrictions under which the funds operate will also be eased. The government will run a pilot business angels style scheme to match potential investors with small firms requiring equity finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will provide more working capital for small to medium sized exporters through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, EFIC. EFIC will also be able to provide increased working capital for a broader range of exports. There will be training for accountants and bankers and assistance to small to medium sized enterprises to obtain advice on export finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In total, these measures will lead to significant improvements in the availability of finance for small to medium sized enterprises. Government purchasing policy will be strengthened to stimulate Australian industry. Firms will be able to use their endorsed supplier status to break into new markets. The impact on Australian industry will be fully considered in all major government purchases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, our future living standards will be determined by our export growth. The government is therefore committed to equipping Australian firms with an excellent export market intelligence network. The government will provide targeted financial assistance to new exporters and promote a growing export culture across Australian industry. The export market development grants scheme, the EMDG scheme, which has been a great success, will be expanded to include single service tourism operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The size of the infrastructure market in Asia is staggering. It will be worth around $600 billion over the remainder of this decade. The government will spend more than $12 million to assist consortia bidding for major infrastructure projects in Asia and it will also expand the trade and diplomatic network and provide additional funding for a stronger Austrade presence in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At home, the government will establish new export centres and develop the exporter hotline service. Because the government wants to see greater export orientation across the whole of the Australian industry, we will strengthen the links between trade and industry at the government level. A new national board of industry, trade and investment will be established by the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) and the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). This will work to develop agreed strategies for trade and investment promotion, export facilitation and industry development. It will ensure the better integration of policy, programs and services between the industry and trade portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of its key tasks will be to spread the message that Australia is a very attractive investment destination. It is a message for both domestic and international investors. Investment has been the important ingredient missing from the recovery so far. I say so far because investment will come. When has the climate for investment in Australia ever been so good? The economy is growing strongly at over four per cent and Westpac is talking about growth of over five per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This growth has been driven by low interest rates and the lowest inflation rate in this country for 30 years. Importantly, this growth is sustainable. The corporate profit share is at a near all time high level. Business confidence in manufacturing is also at a 30-year high and consumer confidence remains buoyant. This government is absolutely committed to a budget deficit of around one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. It is clear that the environment is right for investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not going to leave it to those factors. Access to finance is frequently cited by business as a major constraint to new investment. In the Working Nation statement, the government has made it more attractive for business to invest in infrastructure development. Infrastructure bonds now cover a significantly wider range of activities and their tax treatment is now more generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken these measures to encourage Australian companies to invest in Australia. It is difficult to see what more the government could reasonably do. Now it is simply up to business. Business expects overall investment to grow by six per cent this financial year. This is the right sort of investment. It is not the type of investment we had in the mid-1980s which was speculative and tied up in property. We are now seeing productive investment coming into play. For example, manufacturers anticipate investment growth of 10 per cent. The simple fact is that investment is coming, it will be the right sort of investment and it will considerably boost Australia's economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We particularly want overseas firms to see Australia as a long-term location for strategic investment but there is fierce competition. The Asian countries are eagerly chasing investment to sustain their high growth rates. The government is going to provide special tax incentives and streamline immigration procedures so that more transnational firms establish their regional headquarters in Australia. When we look at all of the proposals and measures outlined in Working Nation and the subsequent measures that were contained in the budget, it is clear that this government is setting up a very strong environment for business growth, business investment and export development. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is in Melbourne attending the annual congress of the Victorian RSL so I will speak on his behalf. The Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill contains important parts of this year's veterans' affairs budget package. It delivers major benefits to the ex-service community and has been developed following extensive consultation with ex-service community leaders. The initiatives respond in part to the recommendations of the Baume committee report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A fair go</EMPHASIS> and concerns expressed by the Australian National Audit Office which the government was bound to address.  <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been considerable misunderstanding concerning review rights following the introduction of this bill. Concerns have been expressed by certain ex-service leaders. As a result the government has worked closely with the ex-service community, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and other non-government parties in the Senate and has agreed to the amendments which were moved by the opposition in the Senate last night. The bill establishes a repatriation medical authority, the role of which is to determine medical scientific issues of causation of injury, disease and death&mdash;matters appropriately left to experts&mdash;and make legislative instruments called statements of principles that set out the causal factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments passed in the Senate last night will establish a specialist medical review council which will review determinations of the Repatriation Medical Authority in certain circumstances. The review council will be made up of a number of councillors selected from lists of names submitted to the minister by medical colleges. The selection of councillors to determine a particular application would be based on the field of specialist medical scientific knowledge relevant to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to ensure that this is not an adversary process, legal submissions will not be able to be put to the review council. The review council will publish a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, inviting submissions to it on the issue. The review council will have before it copies of all material that has been before the Repatriation Medical Authority. Persons who have made submissions to it may appear before it, if they so desire, and there will be no parties to a proceeding before the review council. However, the person who initiated the appeal will have the opportunity to make submissions and will be provided with a statement of reasons for the review council's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to preserve parliament's oversight of statements of principles as disallowable instruments, the specialist medical review council will not be able to commence a review until after any disallowance period has expired. Because the statements are legislative instruments which are made by the Repatriation Medical Authority, its powers will be to require the authority to make any changes that the council directs of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable member for O'Connor for the cooperative spirit in which he has approached the negotiations concerning this bill. I would like to thank the leaders of the ex-service organisations for the way that they have assisted both the government and the opposition in arriving at suitable amendments which will preserve the fundamental scheme of the original legislation and provide further review mechanisms. Finally, on behalf of the minister, I would like to thank his officers and staff whose work made this legislation possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this morning to offer some comments on these amendments to the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill. In particular, I would like to deal with the circumstances surrounding the proposal incorporated in the amendments before us now to establish a specialist medical review council. I do so on behalf of the shadow minister for veterans affairs and defence science and personnel, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). Unfortunately, the government has experienced difficulties with its timetable. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and the shadow minister are both stranded in Melbourne, even though they had made arrangements to be here to shepherd the legislation through the House for the last occasion this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister particularly wanted to be here. He has been very involved in the discussions and negotiations leading to the amendments before us now. I think this is his first bill since he has taken over as the shadow minister in the rearranged frontbench line-up for the opposition of the last month or so. He has unquestionably shown his mettle in his capacity to grapple with a very difficult issue and to negotiate in a constructive way with the government a preferred solution to the plan which was announced when the bill was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) has rightly said, many matters within the government's proposed legislation will provide benefits to the veterans community. As concerned as we have been about one aspect of this bill, it was always our publicly declared intention to support the bill because those benefits should be made available to the veterans community. Confronted with an aspect of the bill with which we had grave concerns, we believed that the most appropriate way for us to proceed was to try to negotiate some amendment or compromise in respect of the proposed Repatriation Medical Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In simple terms, the government's initial proposal was directed at clarifying the processes by which certain entitlements are determined for veterans. In very general terms&mdash;and I do not intend this to be a legal explanation of the current law&mdash;some entitlements are available only if the medical ailment of a veteran can be established to be causally related to war services. In criminal law, which many people would best understand, for a case to be successful the prosecution has to prove his or her case beyond reasonable doubt. That is a very high standard. In a civil case, which I think many people would also have had an association with in some way or another, the case has to be established only on the balance of probabilities. So that is a second general standard of which people might be aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For veterans, the standard of proof is even less, and rightly so. They have incurred their injuries, or in some cases they have died, as a result of their service to their country. So it is appropriate that the government, regardless of its political persuasion, should be very generous in the entitlements that it provides to veterans. The standard of proof under the Veterans' Entitlements Act has really ended up being&mdash;and I stress this in layman's terms&mdash;a standard of proof where the veteran has to establish only that there is a reasonable basis for a reasonable hypothesis and that there is a link between the ailment, or death in some cases, and the war service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This standard of proof has been established by statute and High Court interpretation. The problem is that the definition has become so loose that inconsistencies have developed in various decisions of various bodies in awarding entitlements. That is basically unfair. I think most people would agree that, whatever the law is, it is a basic tenet of fairness and justice that that law be applied equally and consistently. The basis of the government's concern, which has led to this proposal, has been that, whatever the law is, regardless of whether veterans go to some tribunal here or in another state to establish their entitlement, they should get the same treatment. Regardless of whether veterans live in Sydney or Melbourne or whether they go to one tribunal or another, they ought to get the same deal. That basically has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been various reviews. I think the Auditor-General had a look at the issue. Professor Peter Baume, a former senator and minister in the Fraser government, was appointed by the government to look at some of these issues. He basically said that we ought to revert to a civil standard; in other words, a higher standard of proof than currently applies. The government, under political pressure&mdash;and quite rightly so&mdash;rejected that suggestion. Instead, it came up with the bill currently before us today which has a scheme contained in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of this bill is to try to predetermine what would be a reasonable hypothesis. It would be predetermined by an authority called the Repatriation Medical Authority. The government said that this will prevent the situation whereby speculative, fanciful and unsound opinions may determine a medical issue. Its objective is not unreasonable. When the honourable member for O'Connor first read the proposal, he said that there was an obvious problem with it. Ultimately, the bottom line of such a proposal was that it would stop veterans from lodging appeals on medical grounds. That is another unfairness. We started with a problem which was unfair, and the government's remedy also contained an unfairness. The honourable member for O'Connor alerted various organisations, particularly the RSL, to the real problem, which I understand was later confirmed by expert legal opinion. He then set out to try to maintain a sensible solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we obviously did not want to stop the bill, because it contained benefits for veterans. So we had to find a better way. We had to find a solution to the problems identified by the member for O'Connor. That has now been achieved. We appreciate the constructive way in which it has been dealt with. The government accepted the amendments moved on behalf of the coalition in the Senate, and those amendments have now been referred to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments establish a specialist medical review council which, upon a veteran's appeal, can review the statements of principles created by the Repatriation Medical Authority. This is a major development, initiated by the honourable member for O'Connor, negotiated constructively with the support of the coalition and with the sensible support of the minister. We hope that it improves the bill. We believe it does. We also note the minister's second reading commitment to undertake a review of the operation of this new system after 12 months to ensure that the objectives are properly fulfilled by the legislative framework now set in place. Under all of those circumstances, the coalition is very pleased to commend the amendment to the House and to endorse the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) is not here this morning. I wanted to hear his response to some of my points. Unfortunately, that is not going to occur. With the greatest respect, I am not sure that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker), who is at the table, will be as far across the issue as he might need to be to respond. We will see whether that is the case in a few moments time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, as has just been said by my colleague the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), that the result we now have on the Veterans' Affairs (1994-95 Budget Measures) Legislation Amendment Bill is the best that we could get under the circumstances. I echo congratulations to the shadow minister for veterans affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), for the work that he did in a very short time. I commend the minister for being involved in joint consultations with us and the veterans community on this matter, but I make that commendation with some reservations. Whilst we appreciate the fact that the government has changed its mind on this issue and has accepted, to a very large extent, the opposition's position&mdash;it has effectively backed down&mdash;there is no doubt in my mind that the government, through this legislation, has sold out the veterans community. That can be clearly demonstrated. It will be clear to all veterans once this legislation filters down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been very limited consultation on the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority. It is fine that there has been consultation with the heads of peak bodies, and I cast no aspersions on them whatsoever. The former minister made the point in the Senate last night&mdash;I watched last night's debate in the Senate because it was very revealing&mdash;that there were what amounted to secret negotiations behind closed doors on these matters, apparently with the excuse that they were related to the budget and that, therefore, there could not be widespread consultation. That might be a very convenient excuse, but it has amounted to a great deal of suspicion within the wider veterans community about the effect of this particular provision. When the news does filter down&mdash;it is slowly filtering down because members are starting to get input from constituents at large&mdash;there will be an outcry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be an outcry because, as I said at the outset, the government has once again downgraded veterans benefits. There can be no doubt that that is what it has done. It is clearly evident in the legislation. It is evident in the dollars; we do not have to go past the government's estimate of the dollars. The Bushell case was favourable to veterans. The government rushed into the parliament within days of the High Court decision and attempted to reverse it in a ham-fisted way; it ended up being thrown out and it has never come back in that form. It did so ill-advised because at the time the department or the commission told the government that the High Court's decision in the Bushell case was going to cost billions of dollars. It has not, and it will not. The Baume committee said that it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, which is forecasting savings from the implementation of the Repatriation Medical Authority in the order of $20 million over a period, obviously recognises that the Bushell decision was never going to open the floodgates in respect of claims. Through the establishment of the authority, the government has further attempted to circumvent or quarantine the Bushell decision. In that sense, the authority downgrades the status of veterans. It clearly represents&mdash;the dollars prove it&mdash;a diminution of benefits. It represents a reversal or change in the status quo. The situation that exists at the moment is different from what it will be once this legislation is passed and given assent. The result will be that it will be harder for veterans to prove causation. That is ultimately what this is all about. There are all sorts of other elements to veterans claims but, ultimately, the key issue for veterans is causation. The government cannot get around the fact that the introduction of the Repatriation Medical Authority is intended to make the proof of causation more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the secret negotiations that occurred, the veterans community leaders were presented with an all or nothing proposition. They were forced into a deal. It is the same deal that has been given to us today. In other words, `If you don't take the bad with the many good things in this legislation for veterans, the whole lot will go out the window.' That is some sort of offer that has been put to us. That is the legislation we are faced with today. We are faced with voting for a bill which is favourable to veterans in a number of obvious respects but, in respect of the establishment of this Repatriation Medical Authority, is unfavourable to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said to honourable members on this side of the House and to the leaders of the veterans community, `It is all or nothing.' The government will bring these budget measures in only if the government ends up saving money. It will save money because, although there is a cost associated with the good things in this bill&mdash;the provision of benefits for maritime servicemen and so on&mdash;it anticipates saving money from the establishment of this authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in negotiations that have occurred in the interim there has been another layout of bureaucracy with the introduction of a Specialist Medical Review Council. There is no doubt in my mind that that has improved dramatically the situation that existed when the bill was first introduced. But we are still today faced with voting for legislation which, in its net effect&mdash;the bottom line&mdash;is disadvantageous to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot deny that this removes the basic right of veterans access to the courts on the issue of causation. Appeals on the matter of causation should go before proper courts, with medical specialists giving expert advice. That is not going to be the case. A medical star chamber is being introduced to determine matters of causation. I do not use those words terribly lightly. That is what it amounts to. Veterans rights have been abrogated. Every other Australian has the right to access courts and to proper determination. Veterans rights on this issue have been cut off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I contrast, as I did when this matter first came up, the treatment that veterans are getting in respect of the High Court decision. I remind the government that when the High Court made a decision on Mabo, it did not come rushing in here the next day to try to change that decision because it was going to cost Australia billions of dollars; it came rushing in here the next day to widen the effects of that decision. The minister at the table knows all about that; perhaps he can address that issue. Let him deny that that was the case. Rather than saying, `The High Court has made a decision on Mabo that will cost us millions or billions of dollars; we had better do something about it,' the government extended it. The Native Title Act was more generous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it came to the Bushell decision&mdash;a decision that was going to cost the government money&mdash;because veterans were concerned, not Aboriginals, the government rushed in here within a week and wanted to change the law. I do not want to put too fine a point on that. Just the other day&mdash;I do not want to use this in disparaging terms&mdash;a veteran said to me, `Aboriginals run the department of Aboriginal affairs; why aren't veterans running the Department of Veterans Affairs?' I am not sure whether that was a light-hearted comment, but it seemed to me that there might have been a degree of sense or a degree of consistency in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner in the Senate made it clear last night that all review and appeal mechanisms are intact, except on the issue of causation. I underline again that in most cases for veterans the question of causation is the key issue in relation to the determination ultimately of their claims. The end result of this legislaton today is that we have seen the government move relentlessly to quarantine the Bushell decision. It has had a couple of tries to do so and the end result today is that we are effectively blackmailed into supporting legislation which is generally of great benefit to veterans but, in respect of the establishment of this new process, is quite clearly and unarguably against the interests of veterans and is intended to save the government money. That is what this legislation is about: to save the government money. When you compare those savings, say, with the cost of the native title legislation, those few lousy million dollars is money that would otherwise go to veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make the point to the minister and to the parliament that we are not talking here about welfare for veterans, we need always to underline that we are talking about entitlements for veterans. Veterans are entitled to these benefits where they can establish that there is cause and effect between their war service and their state of health, which many of them experience as a result of that war service. So, in many respects, although the government is being generous in aspects of this bill, that generosity is hollow. It is clearly hollow because of the fact that the net effect of this legislation, when you read the detail, is a net saving of money to the government over a period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Senate last night someone indicated&mdash;and I am not sure whether it was Senator Faulkner or one of the other speakers in the debate&mdash;that the Vietnam Veterans Association intended to pursue this matter through to the High Court. I am not sure whether that is the case, but I can assure the House that the input that I have had from Vietnam veterans has certainly been that they are not at all happy with this legislation. I do not cast aspersions on the RSL, and certainly not on its leadership for I have enormous respect for Major General James, but the fault is with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole process has been one of limited consultation and limited time. We cannot blame the RSL, in a sense, when a proposition is presented with a fait accompli to take it or leave it. We cannot blame the RSL for wanting to have a civil and good working relationship with the government. It has to have that, and I understand that. It does not want to be up to its neck, necessarily, in the politics of the whole thing. So, ultimately, the RSL has been forced to accept a situation, I believe, the same way we are being forced to accept a bill today&mdash;through blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Down the line there has not been adequate consultation. My suggestion&mdash;and it was not an acceptable suggestion to the government&mdash;was that we ought to proceed, obviously, with the beneficial aspects of this bill and put aside the requirement for the establishment of the new process until there had been adequate consultation. In my view, it was quite reasonable to suggest that we get on with introducing on 1 July the changes that were of benefit and put aside this controversial change until it had been tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased at least that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has acknowledged, or has given a commitment, that there will be a review of this procedure in 12 months time. I am inherently suspicious of those promises because reviews are promised and sometimes they never eventuate in quite the same way. I can assure him that I and others who, I suppose, on my own admission have a direct interest in veterans affairs will be watching very carefully to make sure that that review takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to make&mdash;and I do not know whether the minister at the table is able to answer this&mdash;is that from my point of view it is important that we understand clearly what is happening here. The only standard to set for the construction of a statement of principles&mdash;and that is what we are about to get&mdash;is the standard already in existence: beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, the statement of principles which we are talking about establishing should be required to adhere to the following terms:</PARA>

<PARA>which is going to look over its shoulder&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>My understanding of the statement of principles is that that will not be the case. I merely summarise by saying, and I mean what I say, that the government has sold out the veterans community once again on this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This talk about secret negotiations and a lack of consultation is wrong in this case. I am advised that the advisory council has been consulting with the minister for eight months on these issues. Admittedly, there are budget considerations, and some of those consultations have been in camera. But, nevertheless, it has been a lengthy period. In addition, there have been two sets of negotiations, because ex-service leaders have also in more recent times been negotiating about these things. So I think the exaggerative approach of the honourable member for McPherson is wrong in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The only other matter that I would like to briefly touch on is the question of the legal standard. I think he is wrong in his interpretation of the legal standard. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) endeavoured to some extent to set out the law there. It is not beyond reasonable doubt and it is not on the balance of probabilities. It is a reasonable hypothesis. The honourable member for McPherson will find that, as the standard is applied in practice, his fears in this regard will be unfounded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will start my contribution to this debate by quoting in part what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said when introducing this documentation into the House on 4 May:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians&mdash;which in turn saps the nation's. It damages the social fabric.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . unemployment threatens to create a permanent underclass.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It threatens to create the conditions for social decay.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government for one is determined to deal with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>I say at the outset that the government fails its own test in relation to this Working Nation white paper documentation. That view has been, and continues to be, shared by many commentators across the country. For example, I will quote from two commentators who are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. One is the former Minister for Finance, Peter Walsh, and the other is Phil Ruthven, one of Australia's better economists. What did Peter Walsh say? I will quote from his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 5 May, where he said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just over two years ago the One Nation statement set out a major program for infrastructure investment, two tranches of tax cuts costing $8 billion a year, and a commitment to a Federal Budget surplus by 1995-1996 which incorporated optimistic economic growth assumptions in the intervening period.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year's Budget brought forward one tranche of tax cuts, deferred&mdash;probably forever&mdash;the second tranche, and set out a strategy for reducing the deficit to 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-1997. That bottom line was dependent on growth equalling the revised forecast, all of the new revenue measures clearing the Senate, and no net additions to outlays up to 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growth so far seems to have exceeded the forecast but cannot be guaranteed for a further three years. The Government lost about $300 million of its enhanced revenue. And yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 4 May&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government announced measures estimated to add $1.9 billion in outlays in 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless major cuts in other programs are announced next week&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>budget week, which they were not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">which is not likely&mdash;the no net additions to outlays component of the strategy has been blown away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fiscal policy targets which were probably too permissive in the first place have become more permissive. Moreover, the statement will continue to add almost $1.9 billion to outlays in 1997-98&mdash;the year beyond the target period&mdash;by which time if all goes well growth will be strong and unemployment will have fallen appreciably.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the foreseeable future, it seems that nearly $2 billion has been added, not as one or two-off recession related programs, but as structural additions to expenditure and, in the absence of higher taxes, to the Budget deficit. Whether the consequences of a higher deficit will detract more from employment than the other measures will add, is arguable.</PARA>
<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the best thing one could say about yesterday's statement is that it could have been much worse. </PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, Phil Ruthven said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifty years ago, the Chifley Government gave Australia a jobs blueprint that lasted two generations and pointed the way to many of the extra 2.5 million jobs that were created, even if it was to be Menzies and Gorton who did the bulk of the implementation. And it didn't take 227 pages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, 8.7 million Australians (49 per cent) want jobs and 7.8 million have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 2001, if 49 per cent of the then population also want jobs, we need 9.8 million. If we settle for 5 per cent unemployment (the average over the past 140 years), we need 9.3 million jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We currently have 7.8 million, but around 700,000 of these will be lost over the next seven years as our businesses become more efficient. That means around 7.1 million of today's jobs in the new and old industries are more or less safe.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need the difference between 9.3 million and 7.1 million in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">new</EMPHASIS> jobs in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">new</EMPHASIS> industries for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">new</EMPHASIS> consumer needs for new employees.</PARA>

<PARA>He finished by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But don't look for them in the White Paper. There is no guiding beacon for the unemployed&mdash;and new entrants in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with what John Stone said in the same edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 5 May, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday's document was thus not about `jobs, jobs, jobs', but . . . about `politics, politics, politics'.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we shall see this year, or early next, it was about throwing up enough dust to obscure the terrible indictment which our unemployment level constitutes on 11 years of Labor rule.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At any rate, for long enough for Mr Keating to lie his way successfully through yet another federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is where the dollars come in; and in yesterday's statement, there were plenty of them.</PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True, the total `package' figure of $6.5 billion over the next four years is advanced principally as headline fodder, and for propaganda purposes in the now forthcoming election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediately important figures are the $1.1 billion of extra spending which yesterday's statement will front-load into the 1994-95 Budget figuring, to be revealed next Tuesday, and the $1.9 billion on-going annual addition thereafter to the `structural deficit'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the point that Peter Walsh made previously. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the then Leader of the Opposition, said this in relation to the white paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's white paper on employment is yet another example of Labor's whole record on unemployment: they created it, they ignored it, they fudged it, they threw money at it, but they could not solve it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is a recognition that Mr Keating's previous promises and policies in the area of unemployment have failed. In reality, the paper will not encourage businesses to generate new jobs. Moreover, it fails to address the root causes of the unemployment crisis which Labor's policies have created.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Ivan Deveson, the Chairman of the Business Council of Australia, say about it? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus on long-term unemployment . . . will give hope to those who have been out of work for a long time. On the other hand, the white paper has not tackled the other key issues of labour costs and restrictive award provisions. Even more disappointing is the inadequate focus on the specifics of how faster micro-economic reform will be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>What did Robert Fitzgerald, the President of ACOSS, one who is not reluctant to support a lot of what the present government says, say on this occasion? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure to ensure an adequate, sustainable growth in the number of available jobs is of particular concern. The absence of any meaningful commitment to public and social infrastructure investment, or tax, trade and industry policy changes, is a glaring hole and will particularly disadvantage rural and regional unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>As someone who represents a rural, regional part of this nation, I agree with him entirely. This and the budget papers reveal that this government only intends to bash the bush once again. As far as the government is concerned, I do not think it could spell the word `rural'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's claims for his white paper are large. Regrettably, they are unlikely to be matched by results. In part, this is because the central problem being addressed, that of long-term unemployment, has an intractable element not amenable to government solutions. The brutal truth is that a significant proportion of the existing long-term unemployed are probably, for various reasons, unemployable, at least in the private sector. They are victims of past policies, notably protectionism, an inflexible labour market and long-term structural change and retraining, and job subsidies will probably not help them. The government has both a moral obligation and a political need to try to disprove this assertion and to at least ensure that those who are employable get job opportunities. What did the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, have to say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS> is nothing more than the inferior offspring of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One Nation</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Investing in the Nation</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It didn't work the first or the second time&mdash;and it won't work the third time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The document does nothing more than churn previous failed policy statements with more taxpayers money.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apparently the Government believes it can fix unemployment by re-naming and re-packaging the programs that have failed to make any significant impact on unemployment previously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than seek to provide genuine employment and jobs, the document seeks to hide the unemployed, by painting them with the invisible ink of a phoney job compact.</PARA>
<PARA>On that point, this white paper has the potential to hide more than 200,000 unemployed Australians from the unemployed figures. The possible figures are as follows: job compact, around 120,000; parenting allowance, around 60,000; CDEP, in the Aboriginal area, a little over 1,000; NEIS, about 1,000; in the ATS and entry level training area, perhaps as high as 17,000 or 18,000; partners allowance, about 3,000; and the mature allowance, around 30,000. The total figure comes to over 200,000 and that does not include the 15- to 17-year olds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes in effective and efficient labour market programs. We want to give as many unemployed people as possible a fair chance of standing on their own feet. This white paper gives no guarantee of this, nor does it take the hard steps to foster the climate of confidence that leads to the stronger economic growth investment necessary for employment growth and the creation of a genuine working nation. Training and retraining courses alone are certainly not the answer, notwithstanding that in my area skillshare is doing a very good job with a large degree of community support under very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister must not be allowed to dress up the unemployed wolf in sheep's clothing with yet another training schedule and get away with it. I am sure that the taxpayer will no longer sign a blank cheque. We need equity and balance, but not at the expense of generating more than equal treatment for minorities. Small businesses need genuine tax reform if jobs are to be generated, as well as modifications to the present training guarantee levy, the superannuation guarantee charge, fringe benefits tax and, very importantly, on the state scene, payroll tax. The government has done none of that or very little. I reiterate what I said when I started, that is, the government clearly fails its own test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper on employment and growth is the culmination of a lengthy process of examination by the government of the changing nature of Australia's economic reality. The overwhelming task faced by the government when it came to office in 1983 was to undertake a wholesale restructuring of the Australian economy and to refocus its efforts to take advantage of the new emerging economic opportunities in our region and around the globe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has managed this change with a degree of compassion and without undue conflict and dislocation, maintaining a social cohesion which is the envy of other industrialised countries and developing countries in the region. As far as restructuring of the Australian economy is concerned, that process has gathered pace throughout the 1990s and will continue to do so beyond the year 2000. I think we need to understand fundamentally how the lives of Australians have changed in the short space of time since this government was elected. I refer here to the wholesale restructuring that has taken place within industry itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the example of the banking system, some 10 or 15 years ago, as one walked around provincial cities like the one that I represent in this parliament, Geelong, there were more branches. When one walked into the banks there were more tellers and I would suspect that in the back rooms there were more bookkeepers than one could poke a stick at, to use some rural parlance. Now most of us do our banking through holes in the wall. The technological innovations in the banking system alone have seen the destruction of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of jobs in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another particular important industry to Geelong is the automotive industry. In the last decade it has undergone massive restructuring. I can recall, barely five years ago, walking around the floors of Ford in Geelong and seeing many welders manufacturing cars. That welding task in the main is done by robots that have replaced the human capital that was previously engaged in that productive activity. The upshot of it all has been that the Ford Motor Co. in Geelong has restructured its operation and shed labour, along with a lot of other automotive companies around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another very simple example of the way in which the economic system has been restructured. Turning to the rural sector&mdash;and the previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), in this debate seemed to have an affinity with things rural; I must say that I have an affinity with it myself, being the son of a dairy farmer, and I have worked the land myself&mdash;we have seen a massive reorganisation of the work task in dairy farming. We have seen herd sizes and productivity improve dramatically. We have seen the bulk handling of the output of the industry. We have seen changes to hay baling and carting. We have seen massive sheddings of labour where the task is now done by one or perhaps two operators. In the crop planting and harvesting that often accompany dairying, in the south-west of Victoria particularly, we have seen, likewise, the introduction of new technologies that have reduced the demand for labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have seen in the Australian economy in the last 10 years is not only a massive restructuring of the economy but also significant increases in overall productivity, which have been achieved without net additions to labour. As far as the refocusing of Australian industry is concerned, the government really did have a major task in 1983 when it came to power to change the business culture in Australia. We have succeeded, I think, in going a long way to achieving that. We see now that many of our major firms have reorganised themselves internally and are engaging in what could be called best practice management. As far as the labour force is concerned, we have noted an increase in the flexibility in the application of labour to the industrial task. Accompanying that we have seen significant increases in labour productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really am intrigued by the obsession that members opposite seem to have with the New Zealand experience. It is often quoted here in this parliament and held up to the nation as one that we should slavishly follow. I am unashamedly Australian and I believe unashamedly in Australian solutions to Australian problems. I think history will record that significant slabs of the great Fightback program that was put as the alternative economic blueprint for this nation were borrowed from the conservative government's economic program in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If indeed the New Zealand experience is one that we should emulate, I wonder why hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders are currently coming to Australia to work, gain employment and enjoy the fruits of our living standards. I do not mean to denigrate the nation across the water, but it is a significant fact that the New Zealand economy under the conservative government has not generated the jobs that would employ New Zealanders. Therefore, New Zealanders have come to Australia to be employed in an economic system that recognises their value to the productive process in material terms and ensures them a reasonable standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as refocusing the Australian economy is concerned, we have seen a massive orientation to export. Initially it was in the area of elaborately transformed manufactures, where we have seen a significant increase in exports, but now we note that it has moved into the services area, particularly tourism, education and health. To give the House an idea of how this change in culture has filtered down through the economy to regional cities and towns, I note with more than a degree of interest that Gordon TAFE and Deakin University in my electorate have got into the export ring and are establishing very strong links with Indonesia. They are very pleasing developments at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the economic base on which the Working Nation initiatives are built is both solid and sustainable over time. The white paper itself provides for a sustained period of economic growth and job creation. I think to understand the full import of this document it really must be viewed in its historical context and also we need an accurate snapshot of where Australia is today. We have entered a new economic era. We have gone through a significant period of restructuring which will continue beyond the year 2000. However, at this point in time we have achieved something that the opposition, which was so critical of this document, has been unable to achieve: sustainable low levels of inflation. We see that the current levels of inflation are the lowest for some 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have the lowest level of interest rates enjoyed for many years. The growth rate of the Australian economy is projected to be around four per cent to five per cent over the next four to five years. We have a massively expanded export base and low levels of industrial disputation, which were not able to be achieved by the opposition when it held the treasury bench. We have seen greater labour market flexibility and, of course, the profitability of industry is now at an all-time high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the key factors in sustaining high levels of growth over the years ahead to the turn of the century is, of course, maintaining high levels of investment, both private and public. Since the budget was delivered we have seen considerable speculation about whether Australia can sustain the levels of investment that are projected in that particular document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think anybody who coolly analyses the investment platform has grounds for a degree of optimism in this area. As I mentioned before, we do have low inflation, a low level of interest rates, improved levels of business profitability, a raft of business incentives in place provided by the government to encourage firms to invest and we have seen a significant improvement in our competitive position, which is always a good incentive for entrepreneurs to enter international and domestic marketplaces with more aggression. That particular platform is a very solid one and I am very optimistic that the high levels of investment that are projected in the budget and which underpin the Working Nation document can be achieved and sustained over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had in recent days a fairly heavy debate in the public arena, and indeed in this House, on the level of interest rates. As those who have a basic understanding of economics would know, the level of interest rates at any one point in time is the product of many factors. It can relate to the way in which the government is managing its fiscal position. I do not think the markets of this country are all that perturbed about the way in which the government is handling its fiscal position. Overseas factors that we have seen quite recently have impacted on the level of expectation in Australia as to whether interest rates would rise. The overall demand for funds is another factor that must be taken into account in assessing the level of interest rates in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this government has achieved the lowest level of interest rates for many years, we can make comparisons with the years of the opposition. The coalition when it had hold of the treasury bench was not able to achieve the low levels of interest rates that this government has been able to achieve. So, inevitably, there will be an increased demand for funds in this economy and interest rates will tend to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really irks me is the way in which the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) over the last couple of months have engaged in a premeditated attempt to talk up expectations in the marketplace about the level of interest rates. Of course, now that we have overseas factors impacting very seriously on markets here in Australia, I think we can honestly say that the irresponsible attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is something we could have done without. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very impressed with the range of industry policy initiatives that have been announced in the white paper. The white paper itself provides for a very comprehensive range of assistance packages that are tailor made and targeted to industry.

I pay tribute to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) and the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) for their efforts in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have finally broken out of the handout mentality of the past.

In that regard I pay tribute to a great Australian and his family, who are not only creating real jobs in this country but providing high quality services to Australians in need. I speak of Doug Moran, his wife, Greta, and his family, who founded the Moran Health Care Group in 1956. Today it is Australia's largest private health care provider.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was privileged to be present last Saturday in Dubbo when the New South Wales Governor, Peter Sinclair, opened the new 60-bed Macquarie Private Hospital in that city. It is something that the people of that city can be very proud of. It was a great day for everyone concerned. There were 500 to 600 people present. After the opening ceremony, when they had a chance to inspect the new hospital, those who had not seen it were absolutely amazed at its facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very bright, modern hospital of the highest quality construction, containing state-of-the-art equipment. It has three of the most modern and best constructed operating theatres imaginable. These are probably not only the best in Australia but, as was said on the day, the best in the Southern Hemisphere. It is great to see such facilities not just in the capital cities of this country but also in country areas such as Dubbo in New South Wales. Country areas have often missed out on quality health facilities. We have only to look at Dubbo Base Hospital, the public hospital, which provides a magnificent standard of health care but is operating under difficult circumstances due to cutbacks in funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was particularly impressed with the personal touches in the new hospital, particularly the art collection adorning the corridors of the hospital. Many of the paintings were done by Greta Moran herself. At a future date, the Moran Health Care Group will construct a retirement village nearby, which will complement the nursing home which it already has in that city. I would like to speak about the Moran Health Care Group because it has been so successful in doing things in this country, such as creating jobs, which we are desperately trying to do today. The Moran Health Care Group has a motto, `Don't predict the future; make it happen.' I think that is particularly apt. Mr Moran and his family have certainly carried that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Moran and his family have built private hospitals, nursing homes, retirement villages, hostels, medical centres and related health care facilities, and serviced apartments for the frail aged throughout New South Wales and Queensland. They have 3,500 hospital and nursing home beds and employ 7,500 people, which is a magnificent achievement. The mind boggles.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His wife, Greta, is essential to the team. Their success in the health care area since their marriage in 1957 is due to the two of them. They are inseparable. She was a graduate nurse. In his early days he was a real estate and property developer in Sydney. The combination of his business skills, which were particularly lacking in the nursing home industry in the 1950s, and her health care skills has created an amazing dynasty in Australia. They started off in the health care industry when they had an aging relative who needed nursing home care. They leased a harbour side home at McMahons Point in Sydney and converted it into a 16-bed nursing home. They went from there. They have seven children. Most or all of them are involved in the Moran Health Care Group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at their family histories. Doug Moran's father was a coalminer who worked in the Newcastle area in the Depression. He later moved to Gympie, where Doug grew up. Doug went on to serve with distinction in the merchant navy in World War II. In 1946 he returned from England to Australia and served on the coastal and trans-Tasman shipping routes. Later he moved into real estate in Sydney, particularly specialising in the housing needs of the immigrants who were flooding into the country in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His wife, Greta, has a fascinating family history. One of her ancestors was a fellow named Robert Cooper, a British distiller and businessman of prominence a century or more ago.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was pardoned by Governor Macquarie in 1818 and invited to develop a distillery for the colony. He sired 28 children, which I think is an absolutely remarkable achievement, and did many other things of note. For example, he built Juniper Hall, named after the berry used in the gin he was distilling, in Paddington. It was built in 1824 and is Australia's oldest surviving suburban villa. He was also instrumental in the construction of Sydney Grammar School. </PARA>

He is a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London, a vice-patron of the Royal Art Society of New South Wales and the patron of the Doug Moran national portrait prize. The shadow minister at the table, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), will be opening the exhibition of the 30 finalists in the old Parliament House tonight. I urge every member to attend because it is going to be a great event. One hundred thousand dollars is put aside as first prize and $60,000 is to be divided up amongst the other contestants.

Shane is a bachelor of commerce, bachelor of laws, master of laws, executive director of the Moran Health Care Group, principal of a Sydney based firm of solicitors and attorneys, a fellow of the Taxation Institute of Australia, an associate of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, and a notary public. Shane's qualifications in law, including a masters degree in international business law, and in commerce, majoring in accounting, finance and systems, plus international experience in commercial law, chartered accounting, international business finance, taxation and general administration enable him to control the corporate, legal and administrative functions of the health care group. He has undertaken considerable studies and work outside Australia, and is fluent in German, Spanish, French, Chinese Mandarin, Italian and Japanese.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to see the quality of Doug and Greta's children, and seeing that gives some insight into why they have been so successful. I am delighted that they have built many nursing homes and private hospitals in country areas, not just in Sydney, Brisbane and places like that. For example, there is an 80-bed nursing home in Bathurst; an 80-bed nursing home in Dubbo; the 60-bed Jessie Hunt Nursing Home&mdash;named after the mother of Ralph Hunt, a former member of this House&mdash;in Narrabri; the 80-bed Maitland Nursing Home in Rutherford; a 50-bed nursing home in Mudgee; a 100-bed nursing home in Murwillumbah; an 80-bed nursing home in Narrandera; 31 units in the Bathurst Gardens Retirement Village; and 220 units and 51 apartments in the Mountain View Retirement Village in Murwillumbah.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the Working Nation document. The document is an important element in the broader economic recovery approach that has been fundamental to our policy direction over the last couple of years. I believe that the combination of the Working Nation document and this year's budget contributed to very real strides being made in consolidating the recovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting a few of the statistics comparing Australia's position with that of other OECD countries. All too often, opposition members put to us that the recovery is not being sustained. There have been assertions that we were going to have double-dip recessions and other problems and that the recovery would not be a durable and enduring one. The last quarterly growth figures show that Australia is now growing at a rate of five per cent and that there is a real underlying growth rate of about 4.3 or 4.4 per cent. That very significant level of growth is the envy of other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our inflation rate has stayed low throughout the recovery and the outlook is also for sustainable low inflation. For the first time in 20 to 25 years, we have been able to make the confident boast that we can have an economic recovery built upon the strong foundation of low inflation. All of the wages decisions taken by the government, in conjunction with the ACTU, are designed to reinforce the maintenance of that strong low inflation recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Export growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector, has grown substantially in the last 18 months. That is an important part of the revitalisation of our economic performance, but also a recognition of our new capacity in international competitiveness. We now have an open economy, built upon the strengths of an international trading arrangement, in which our companies can compete. Our small and medium sized enterprises in particular are more inclined to look towards export market opportunities and are therefore playing their part in driving export growth in the manufactured goods sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past six to seven months there has also been strong growth in employment. All those who look at these issues in terms of economic cycles would say that employment&mdash;along with business investment, which is usually one of those lag elements in getting a recovery going&mdash;is going to be the last to show a significant improvement. Employment has started to move substantially. Last month's figures showed an unemployment rate of 9.8 per cent. This is still too high, and I would not argue otherwise, but we have had a growth in jobs in excess of 275,000 in the last seven months. This is a very significant turnaround in employment growth. It is also a recognition of what is occurring in the community at large and of the new economic and employment opportunities being created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can confidently predict that that growth will be continuing, despite the movement in the participation rate that will inevitably occur. It is interesting to look at international comparisons to see how strong the participation rate has remained in Australia over the last six to seven years. It will no doubt pick up again as in economic recoveries more people seek to move back into the work force. We have been able to have that strong participation rate while still having an overall improvement in the number of people in jobs and the percentage of people in employment. They are the sorts of background settings that are important when looking at what Working Nation seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental thing that we sought to ensure through that process, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made clear on election night, 13 March 1993, was that this economic recovery was one in which all Australians share. That is important. There is a tendency with international comparisons to see only economic changes that are occurring in some parts of the world. Because of structural adjustment considerations, and because regions might have particular industries that have been unable to meet the competitive pressures and the like, strong pockets of unemployment have developed in some regions that are, in a sense, intractable unless there is positive action on the part of government. We know that in many cases growth and economic change alone will not be sufficient to provide new jobs in many parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been true in areas like western Sydney and in industries like clothing, textile and footwear. That has equally been true in parts of regional Australia, where in the past particular industries employed a large number of people, often in limited or low skill areas. Those jobs are now being taken over as a result of restructuring in these industries&mdash;either through increased mechanisation or as a result of the different approaches that industries take when conducting marketing activities. The level of skill needed in the work place to match that adjustment process has displaced many people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That means the government has had to constructively  address ways of skilling our work force to ensure that all people are able to participate in employment opportunities as they come along. In recent times major efforts and resources have been put into our technical and further education sector. That will be an important part of providing the skill levels that people need. The range of labour market programs have also been an important part of that process. Clearly, the efforts that institutions put in to the transition arrangements from school to TAFE college and to work become important building blocks as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear that the government had to do more to skill unemployed people, particularly those out of work for a significant period, 12 months or more, to a level which enabled them to take advantage of employment opportunities as they came along. That observation relates to unemployed people out of work for extended periods not just in Australia but in most developed countries. We need very significant, pro-active arrangements to get those people back into the employment market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparisons can also be made with New Zealand. Its economy is now growing, even though the actual labour market has not grown significantly. New Zealand is starting to have skill shortages in some areas, despite the unemployment rate of over nine per cent. Many in New Zealand have expressed concern about that matter, and that is the sort of issue the Working Nation statement is designed to address in an effective way. It will ensure that something is done to provide a skills base so, as economic recovery gathers momentum, we get full value for all unemployed people who have been and are looking for work, irrespective of whether or not they have been out of the work force for a significant period. That is why the fundamental elements of the Working Nation statement are important. That is why the Prime Minister said that this recovery would be a recovery for all and that we would have policies enabling all unemployed people the opportunity to receive constructive, long-term training and job commitment on the part of the government in conjunction with the private sector. I think that is a very significant approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting the fundamental elements of the job compact in the white paper. Amongst other things, it will provide more intensive case management; training and support to ensure that the unemployed person is job ready; a job for six to 12 months, primarily in the private sector; a training wage which combines employment with training, leading to recognised and transferable skills; new work opportunities which will encourage local proposals for employment generation, especially in regions where other employment opportunities are limited; and intensive jobsearch assistance. These are major concerns in most regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a discussion on Friday with the manager of DEET in my local area. About 25,000 people in the broader Parramatta DEET region have to be catered for. Clearly, it would have been abhorrent to the government to consider a proposition that did not do real and meaningful things to address the needs of those long-term unemployed people. If we multiply the 25,000 people in the region that I represent by all the regions across the nation, we see just what a commitment the government is giving in terms of that job compact&mdash;it is a real obligation. Equally, at the same time, we are asking for a real commitment on the part of unemployed people because of the resources and endeavours that we are requiring of the Department of Employment, Education and Training, other providers and the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the youth training initiative&mdash;another very important element of the Working Nation statement&mdash;and the opportunities that provides. It is clear that there needs to be a far greater focus on the transitional arrangements that apply to young people as they leave school and go into college. Indeed, the whole path from school to vocational training to the workplace and so on needs to be far more seriously addressed than has been the case in the past. So the youth training initiative is an important part of saying to young people, `We are determined to do something about the level of youth unemployment; this is a real, concerted way of ensuring that we give real commitment to you and we are expecting real obligation in return.' Working Nation is not just about the government taking the initiative but also about long-term unemployed people having opportunities and real obligations to take advantage of those chances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move now to other elements of the statement. There has been a big focus on a range of areas dealing with training in the regions of Australia. Again, I think that is part of ensuring that the skilled work force capacity across the nation is developed in the way it should be. Amongst other things, the regional development initiatives in this package include arrangements to fast-track the development of the international airport at Badgerys Creek. That is a very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numerous studies have identified the value of Badgerys Creek as not only an international airport but also an aviation facility for the broader Sydney region, as it will have a catalyst impact on regional development in western Sydney. It needs to be remembered that western Sydney is a very significant region of Australia&mdash;a region with over 1.5 million people, bigger than most of the capital cities of Australia. It is a distinct region and has particular characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McKinsey report identified a series of companies in western Sydney that are very much a part of the export drive in manufacturing, which should be what Australia is all about. Often that is not understood by people when they talk about regions and what opportunities exist. The real opportunities to create employment in those industries in western Sydney are unequalled in any region of Australia. The employment growth and investment in manufactured exports that have occurred over the last five years in western Sydney are greater than in any region in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing a region like western Sydney there is a capacity to see how important the transport hubbing and the convenience of the region are. We should utilise targeted public sector investment to encourage that development to occur and we should encourage the facilitation of much greater private sector investment in the region as well. That is what the Working Nation initiatives propose for regional development. It is not expecting a large amount of public expenditure; rather it is expecting constructively targeted public expenditure that the private sector will build on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">McKinsey's work makes it clear that our economic future depends on small to medium sized companies that are innovative, outward looking and have an export focus. That is precisely the sort of thing that exists in western Sydney and that is precisely the sort of area that Working Nation encourages in the future. I believe the Working Nation document, along with the budget, provides real opportunities for all Australians to share in employment growth in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The release of the government's Working Nation document was a cover-up by the government of the real reasons why we have a million unemployed people in Australia. In May 1994 more than 8,200 people in the Bendigo region were recipients of unemployment benefits from the Department of Social Security. The white paper, as the government called it&mdash;it has tried to title it Working Nation&mdash;highlighted the government's problems in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed to recognise that most of the difficulties caused by unemployment relate back to the policies implemented by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer. He became federal Treasurer way back in 1983. Most of his economic policies, which were implemented then, resulted in massive interest rate increases and a steady rise in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister became Treasurer in March 1983. At that time, the interest rate for housing loans was 12.5 per cent and it was 16 per cent for business loans. By December 1985&mdash;just two years after he became Treasurer; he had the opportunity to implement many of his policies&mdash;businesses were being hit with an interest bill of 21 per cent and more. Interest rates on business loans had moved from 16 per cent to 21 per cent in just two years and interest rates on housing loans subsequently rose to 17 per cent and more. It is not surprising that many thousands of small businesses went bankrupt under the Prime Minister's interest rate regime, which was quite tragic for rural and regional areas. I will mention some of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small businesses in the Bendigo federal electorate found that they were in extreme financial difficulty because of the massive increase in interest rates imposed on them by the Keating government. Due to the high interest payments, many farmers were forced off the land. They were forced to sell up&mdash;they left productive land which was contributing to Australia's export drive&mdash;take what they got for their properties and move into areas like Bendigo and Maryborough to try to find some form of work in another field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was quite obvious that it would not be possible for many farmers to be placed because of the difficulties small businesses in regional and country areas were having at that time with the massive increases in interest rates, which they were simply unable to cope with. Small businesses found that it was necessary to shed staff and reduce their work force. They incorporated members of their own family into the family business to try to help the business survive. The pressures on the family unit at that time were enormous. It is not surprising that many thousands of small businesses went bankrupt under that interest rate regime. In January 1993 the number of unemployed had grown to over one million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having created that problem, the Prime Minister now wants to spend about $5 billion of taxpayers' money to reduce the number of employed before the next federal election. Let us not have any doubts about the strategy. Working Nation is purely and simply designed to remove the long-term unemployed&mdash;approximately 300,000&mdash;from the unemployed figures prior to next the federal election. The Prime Minister is going to reduce those numbers by throwing $5 billion of taxpayers' money at the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any employment that is created through the Working Nation program will be short term. Employment under the job compact will last for only six or nine months. People who have been out of work for over 18 months will qualify for the job compact. They will be put into a short-term position for six or nine months and then, as a beneficiary under the job compact, they will be removed from the unemployment lists and the figures will start to look quite impressive. I can almost read the lips of the Prime Minister when he says to the press, `Here we go. The economy is coming good. We are reducing unemployment. The numbers of unemployed are decreasing month by month as we put people onto the job compact on a short-term basis.' It will all look very impressive to the unsuspecting Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of things that has come out of Working Nation is the fact that the government has finally addressed the question of a training wage. Honourable members might remember that, in the lead-up to the last election in 1993, the coalition spelt out to the Australian community that there was a need for a training wage to encourage the employment of young people in industry and commerce. This would enable young people to at least get their foot in the door. They would have the opportunity to gain some meaningful employment through training, which is the key to their ultimate success and long-term employment prospects. To give a person a short-term employment prospect of six or nine months work and then take that person off the job compact and replace him or her with somebody else who has built up 18 months on the unemployed list is not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has finally admitted that the coalition had it right. It was correct to have a training wage which would encourage the employment of young people. They would get adequate training for a long-term career and not short-term employment for six or nine months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation will not solve Australia's long-term unemployment. It will not make any improvements to unemployment because it has not made any improvements to the national economic strategies the government has in place. The government has gone off the rails in its regional development strategy. Regrettably, the government included the capital cities in its regional strategy. Instead of focusing on regional cities like Bendigo, Ballarat and rural areas, the regional policy, which was implemented by the government and which the government is focusing on, includes capital cities like Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Brisbane and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know of the political muscle of the capital cities when it comes to the distribution of funds.

I am grateful to the minister for what he provided to part of my electorate, but there is still much to be done by the government. Its focus is on the capital cities. Let us face it: the capital cities have much greater political muscle than regional areas such as Bendigo and Ballarat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the government's building better cities program would have concentrated on regional areas outside the capital cities of Australia and that the majority of money would have gone into building better cities outside the urban sprawl. The money could have gone into building better cities which would create job opportunities for young people throughout Australia. It would have been a very good way to stimulate economic growth in regional areas outside capital cities. But the Keating government decided that it would put most of the money into the capital cities. The real difficulty lies in trying to address the question of high unemployment in rural and regional areas of Australia, and the government certainly has not addressed that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional development strategy, which the Keating government has put in place, has focused very clearly on these capital cities. Most of the money spent on major projects&mdash;in fact, the ratio is more than 10 to one&mdash;has been distributed to the metropolitan cities of Australia. It is quite obvious that that pattern will continue and that regional areas outside capital cities will once again become the poor relation, even though they have some of the highest unemployment figures in the nation. At various times, some of these small regional areas in parts of my electorate have had unemployment levels of 39 per cent. That forces people to shift their place of residence to a capital city in search of work. Of course, that affects the whole rural community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional development strategy that the government released some time ago contained some good recommendations. Surprisingly, the committee headed by Mr Bill Kelty of the ACTU made a very good recommendation with respect to the development of infrastructure in regional areas outside capital cities. But, strangely enough, the government did not take up that recommendation. That was one of the recommendations in the government's regional strategy document with which I agreed. Providing infrastructure to capital cities costs about 10 times more than providing it to some of these areas outside the capital cities. Even though the transportation and communications costs are slightly higher, the development of infrastructure in areas such as Bendigo would encourage metropolitan industries to relocate and new industries to establish themselves in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That recommendation was put forward by the Kelty committee, but it was not adopted by the government. The government still has scope to do something in that regard, but it has not taken the opportunity to do so. It has been focused simply on the prospect of removing the 300,000-plus people from the long-term unemployed list between now and the next election. It is simply a strategy to win at the next poll, and I do not think any member on the other side would deny that. They are very keenly aware of the problem that the high numbers of unemployed people is creating for them in their own electorates.

If any mistake has been made by government, it has been because it has not looked at our history to see what has happened in the past. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, I have been involved in considering the work force of the future. We have gathered some valuable information. We have received most of our information from business and academic organisations, political groups and other community groups. Quite a lot of national organisations have also given evidence to the committee. One of those groups is IBIS Business Information, which I mentioned before. It has clearly shown, through its submissions to the committee, that we are in danger of ignoring history, that some of the things that have happened in the past will happen again and that we ought to be working in recognition of those trends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a sense, IBIS Business Information is asking us to think about how people worked together before the Industrial Revolution. It has pointed out that, in a very real way, both unions and employers have what IBIS calls a subliminal gaoler's attitude. Employers believe that they have to keep people working in an area. Employees, some of whom descended from convicts, believe that they need to be regimented and they just want to make the conditions better. Big problems develop from that attitude, and we need to tackle those. For instance, at a time of recession or depression, there may be a need for people to move. I can remember a former minister for employment, Mick Young, telling me how much more mobile people were in the United States than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that we have had a tendency to put down our growing services sector. We have become blind to the reality that, in respect of world trade, our services sector, which was 10 per cent in 1950, is expected to increase to 50 per cent in the year 2000. Agricultural products, minerals and manufactured products are still important. We need to put a lot of effort into making sure that we add value here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to recognise the fact that the services sector is a legitimate sector. Unfortunately, just as a century or so ago people regarded mining as something that was done by the household or by the farmer and did not regard it as legitimate for firms to mine, we now tend to put down some of the service occupations. It is wrong for people to establish pecking orders and put down service occupations. That is quite offensive. It is the person who looks down on a waiter, or a doorperson, or a bouncer, or someone who is mowing lawns who has a problem, not the person doing the job. That attitude should not be allowed to infect the rest of society. Not only do these people have a legitimate occupation, but they may be developing towards another occupation through that job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My son started as a film runner for a computer graphics firm that he wanted to work for in London. Just as your son, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, started at the bottom, my son progressed from that job as a film runner and gradually insinuated himself into the firm. He was co-winner of an advertising award, and now he is in the United States making movies for people like George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. That is what can happen with people who are prepared to see a job as legitimate, although they may even want to stay in that particular job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point is the importance of outsourcing. It has happened continually. At the moment 51 per cent of an adult's work is unpaid housework, so housework provides an opportunity for outsourcing. If we can get work done by someone else in a fraction of the time and done more cheaply than we could do it ourselves, then surely it is worth trying. As well as that, business and farming people could profitably outsource. There are a whole range of opportunities which people can take through outsourcing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, I believe that we ought to go beyond what is within the employment paper and look at the opportunities that are going to come up in Australia and that, in fact, will be available to the whole of the world. One of the opportunities for outsourcing in business would be computer software&mdash;and that is happening already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In farming it could include harvesting and all sorts of jobs on the farm which are at present being done by the farmer, who very often has to buy expensive equipment, which he often holds on the property. For instance, in Sunraysia the government is putting in quite a substantial amount of funds for regional development. If the people there who lost their farms through the proposed mergers were to put their farms together, there would be occupations for those who wanted to take on contracting work, whether it be in harvesting, fencing, or any of the other sorts of jobs on farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Outsourcing provides particularly good opportunities for people in business. It is also a good opportunity for people in the provision of home services. Very often people would be glad to obtain a trusted and well-provided service. However, at the moment in families where both partners work, people come home and they have to get to work fixing the house up. If a trusted and well-presented service were available to people in the area of home duties, then it would fill a need. At the moment, potential users are inconvenienced by all sorts of things, such as washing dishes, looking after their swimming pool, helping their children with homework, minding aged relatives in the home, preparing meals, washing cars, cleaning house, minding children, assisting with study, and doing odd jobs and home maintenance. Very often they do not trust anyone to do this work, or else they cannot find a person of quality to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it will not be very many years before firms which can do this are formed. Already there are firms in the larger cities, like Sydney and Melbourne, which make themselves available to do paid nursing, for instance. I believe that a need has been established for home services. There are plenty of examples of people who can do it. For instance, there is a firm in Sydney called Dial An Angel, which people can phone for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are tremendous advantages, but the process will take quite a long time. What the government could do is encourage the process by providing a system of tax deductibility for outsourcing. This would take people out of the cash economy. At the moment they are asking for cash for work done and specifying that they do not want any reporting to the tax office. There would be an opportunity for an employing person to say, `I can get a tax deduction if I employ you, and I want to take advantage of that tax deduction.' Tax deductibility could be phased down from, say, 100 per cent in the first year to nothing in the 11th year. This would encourage employment, it would encourage industry to set up on a larger scale, and it would be of benefit for all involved&mdash;for those employed and for those employing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we could take the example of the job compact outlined in the Working Nation paper and we could specify, as the Commonwealth Employment Service does now, that people have to stick to the rule that there are no benefits if they do not take a job that is available. History shows that employment boosts have always come from the movement of services from home occupiers to outside providers&mdash;for instance, in the areas of tourism, catering, takeaways, restaurants and transport. When I was a child very few people went for holidays other than to the homes of relatives. Now people go for holidays to motels, to caravan parks, to all sorts of places, and a much smaller percentage go to relatives than previously. Laundry and dry cleaning is another area which has shown change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director of IBIS, Phil Ruthven, told of how he employed a firm called Jim's Lawnmowing. Jim would come around and mow lawns for him. Jim had four different lawn-mowers, so Phil asked, `Why do you have four different lawn-mowers?' He said, `There are at least four different types of lawn to mow, and I am much quicker and do a much better job if I use the right lawn-mower.' Now it is no longer Jim's Lawnmowing; it is a large enterprise which is doing work all over Melbourne. That is because those people are specialists, they do the job quicker than the householder himself or herself can do it, and they do a good job because they use the right equipment for the right service. We ought to be recognising the legitimacy of these services at the same time as we are adding value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be supporting the Working Nation package right through my electorate, and I believe other members are taking advantage of the packages within Working Nation. What I have said before does not get away from the fact that we need to skill and that it is far better to skill people here in Australia than to bring people from overseas. It is far better to skill the unemployed, particularly if they have been unemployed for 18 months or more, and encourage people to employ them through the incentives that are mentioned in the Working Nation paper. It is far better to say to anyone below 18 years, as we are now going to say under the application of this paper, `You can't get unemployment benefits anymore. Either you are at school or you have a job or we will train you.' So I believe there will be great benefits, particularly in the area of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister at the table, the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee), helped develop the recently announced $10 million package for the south-east forests of New South Wales that requires a local committee to be formed.

It is for me a great disappointment that in 1994 a federal Labor government has given up on employing Australians. The Labor government no longer believes in a full employment policy, it has no prescription for rebuilding our industries that it has devastated, and it has no plan of action to put back to work all those Australians who not only want jobs but need jobs for their health and sanity. Here we are in mid-1994 with approximately 900,000 Australian men and women who desire paid work without jobs. In May of last year we had over 423,000 individuals classified as long-term recipients of income support for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that the unemployed, the underemployed, the discouraged job seekers and the dependent children of adults without work total in excess of two million Australians directly scarred by the lack of employment opportunity. Yet with this paper, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, the government has addressed unemployment but not employment. It is not a vision for the future and how we will employ Australians but a series of packages and measures which will act to ameliorate the disastrous effects of unemployment on individuals' lives. In that respect, I find no great fault with the paper. I am not sure that all the programs will work the way they are intended to; I am not confident that the competition that is proposed for CES will be successful. However, essentially the problem is that the white paper is not a paper on employment; it is a paper on unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Labor has given up on any goal of full employment is no more amply demonstrated than in a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when speaking to the white paper on 4 May. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions are tailored to meet the needs of the unemployed in the modern Australian economy. They will serve Australia for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>That says a lot, does it not? It says that the Prime Minister believes that this package of measures will serve the unemployed but not that it will find them useful, real employment. The Managing Director of BHP, Mr John Prescott, said of the white paper:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The resolution of unemployment will only come through fundamental growth and what would help growth is an idea of where we want to be in the future. Too much of the debate so far has been an economic debate.</PARA>
<PARA>John Prescott said what many in industry are saying: that we as a nation need a vision or a strategy&mdash;or a goal&mdash;for the future that recognises that full employment depends on economic growth, not programs; and that the economic debate over the past decade or so has concentrated on theoretical economics to the detriment of debate on the very practical opportunities and constraints faced by Australian producers of goods and services in both the domestic and international marketplaces. We in Australia need industry and we need jobs to fulfil the desires of Australians for products and services and useful work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went through a long period from the mid- to late-1940s until the early 1970s when Australia knew not what unemployment meant. We once reached the grand rate of 3.17 per cent unemployment, which was considered the limit beyond which a country could not sustain its people. Now we have lived with 11 and 12 per cent unemployment. We talk about considering five per cent unemployment to be the absolute minimum level that we have any chance of reaching. I do not know what the minimum level is, but I am confident that there must be many actions we can take to try to repair the problem in order to make employability and employment a reality for more and more Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Back in 1945 the Curtin Labor government issued a white paper on full employment, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential condition of full employment then is that Government spending should be high enough to stimulate private spending to the point where the two together will provide a demand for the total production of which the economy is capable when fully employed.</PARA>
<PARA>I am not sure that I really agree with the conclusions of the white paper, but it was written by the bright young economists of the time&mdash;when there was a great shortage of them, I might mention&mdash;and really introduced Keynes to Australia. Keynesianism is an economic policy which is very comfortable with socialism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 the government has released another white paper on employment, but it is essentially a series of training programs and other labour market programs designed to ease the burdens of the long-term unemployed. The paper does not deal with the creation of employment opportunities in a positive sense. It is not an industry policy and there is not political agreement among the Labor Party, Liberal Party, the coalition of industry or even the community on how to reach full employment or even what it is. The white paper conveys no sense of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long period when Australians were fully employed was a time when our agricultural products and the outputs of our mines were sold to the rest of the world at good prices and a time when we did not need to market them because the world was eager to purchase them. All we had to do was figure out how to grow them, produce them, process them or dig them out of the ground and transport them to other countries. The income from those commodities then provided us with one of the highest standards of living in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that income generated, we then built a manufacturing industry behind one of the highest tariff walls in the world. So Australia was in every sense an isolationist nation. We were an island nation continent in the South Pacific surrounding by a huge wall which was in many respects impenetrable. Behind that wall the manufacturing industry we built was, in many cases, inefficient, displayed poor quality and, in most cases, had no idea of commitment to service to the customer&mdash;because it was not necessary. The industry protected by tariffs, the competition was not available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1970s when Whitlam came to power and we had the first of two major oil shocks that Australia felt the effects of during the 1970s, when Labor went riot and increases in the price of labour went through the roof, and when Whitlam in one fell swoop whacked 25 per cent off the tariff rates, our manufacturing industry went into spasm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1962-63 manufacturing industry represented 26.2 per cent of the gross national product of Australia. However, by 1992-93 it represented only 14.7 per cent of the gross national product of Australia. All manufacturing nations in the Western world have experienced some decline in manufacturing as a percentage of their output. The telecommunications industry, the knowledge industry, the transport industry and the service industries have each increased in importance but no other nation has gone so far towards destroying its ability to make the products and supply the services that its citizens require for daily use as has Australia. We have destroyed in essence the very basis of what helps supply our needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are faced with the problem now that every time Australia comes out of a recession, when people start to gain confidence, when people want to go to the stores and buy, they have to suck in imports at a great rate. So our spending on imports increases, not our spending on Australian produced products and services. Why? It is because too much of our manufacturing industry is gone. Too much of it has been blown away and too much of it is too small and too diverse to obtain any critical mass to be able to truly influence the world marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really have only two significant world class companies that can structurally affect the market anywhere else in the world. The first of those is BHP. BHP today is not very happy with this government. It is not very happy with economic prospects in Australia and so it is investing offshore. That is because of the difficulties placed in its way in terms of resource development by the Mabo legislation and by the government's lack of commitment to reducing the current account deficit to enable us to survive after the recession without having an inflated economy. So the investment that BHP, a world-class player is making, is unfortunately not in Australia. It will ultimately benefit Australia but it certainly is not going to provide Australians with jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second world-class company that we have is Telecom, now called Telstra. Telecom, particularly now with competition from Optus, has become the second most significant provider of telecommunications services in this part of the world. It is second only to Japan. Telecom has a tremendous opportunity to take with it into South-East Asia all those small and medium sized companies that supply it with engineering services and supply it with products that it needs to build a telecommunications network. But this Labor government is now talking about selling Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that if Telecom is to continue to be able to supply the infrastructure that we need in Australia for a modern, high speed telecommunications system, and if it is going to be able to compete in South-East Asia, then it needs capital. But the government has not got the capital to give it to enable it to grow at the rate at which it should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have two concerns about Telecom. I hope the government agrees to privatise it. But I will tell you what, if you do decide to privatise it by hiving off yellow pages or white pages or mobile net and leave us with the core but without enough critical mass to haul all the other bits and pieces with it into South-East Asia, then you will have done Australia a great disservice because we will have lost one of the jewels in the crown. We will have lost one of our only two significant world-class companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if you are going to sell it, sell it to Australians. Do not sell it to overseas interests, because overseas interests will not use Australia as the base to carry us into South-East Asia. The small and medium sized companies in my electorate that manufacture for Telecom, that surround it with world-class products and world-class services, will not get to South-East Asia because they will not have the vehicle to carry them there. By all means sell it to give it the capital to expand, but make sure that you sell it as an entity and you sell it to the moms and pops of Australia, not to the Yanks, not to AT&amp;T, not to Bell Pacific, not to Bell Atlantic, and definitely not to the Poms either.

Too often we ignore history or, in the case of some of our leaders today, distort and lie about history. Let us look at the history of probably the greatest manufacturing entity that has ever existed in the world, the United States. How was the fortune of the United States of America built? It was built on protection, protection on a scale that Australia never conceived of. The average level of protection in manufacturing in the United States was between 50 and 60 per cent. What the Americans had was a policy of enormous competitive protectionism. There was enormous competition within their own community, and it was this competition that made them very capable of taking on the world, but their industry certainly was protected from international competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This occurred up until 1983, when the United States decided it would declare class war on its own people and adopted the policies of free trade. What this has bequeathed to America is enormous loss of prestige, enormous loss of economic power, debt out of control and a burgeoning underclass. The underclass in America, probably 20 per cent, is living a life which I would certainly not like to see in this country. I do not believe you can hold a country together when you deliberately set out to build such an underclass.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States says that its problems would be solved if only the wicked Japanese would lift all their tariff barriers and other sorts of barriers.

America has lost $300 billion in this mad cause of international trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should add that average wages in the United States are now down to 1954 levels. That does not mean that everyone in the United States is getting less: some people are obviously getting a lot more, and some people are getting none at all. There has obviously been an enormous increase in the gap in the wealth and lifestyle that different people enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that the same thing is starting to happen in Australia. Wages in this country are now down to 1974 levels, and yet we boast about it. We say, `What a good thing this is.' Once again, it does not mean that everyone is getting less: some people are getting a lot more, and some people are getting a lot less. How has this come about? It has come about quite simply. We have blitzkrieged blue-collar jobs and middle management jobs. That is where the trauma lies in Australia today. People talk about youth unemployment, but a far greater problem is middle-aged unemployment. For them there is less hope and less opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the blue-collar culture&mdash;whether the feminists like it or not&mdash;it is seen as a requirement that the male be the breadwinner. What have we done? We have taken away the blue-collar worker's job and we have replaced it with jobs for his wife and jobs for his kids&mdash;part-time jobs, low paid jobs&mdash;but not jobs for him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said&mdash;it was said by the member for La Trobe and it was said by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;that tariffs destroyed the Australian manufacturing industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, then, as today, all economic decisions were made on one or two bases. Economic decisions are made either on the basis of fear of loss or on the basis of hope of gain. The idea was that by inviting in the nice Americans we could not fail. General Motors knew how to build cars. It could not fail. I think the firm was sustained by a $7 million loan from the Bank of Adelaide, guaranteed by the then federal government, and so we got a second-class American car&mdash;the Holden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had we designed a car for Australia, it would have been a car with unique properties. At that time, because we had large distances to cover, it probably would have been a six-cylinder car, with high ground clearance because of the condition of a lot of our roads.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are going to have a manufacturing industry, I am not suggesting a return to complete tariff protection, although I do not resile from tariffs where they may be necessary. But you have to be intelligent about it; you have to decide what industries you want. There are clear categories. One category is those industries for which we have a strategic need, industries that we would need if the world were to catch fire tomorrow and leave us isolated. Those are the industries that may need some tariff protection. I note with interest that Israel has done this very well.

It does it by buying Australian wool and value adding it. We are moving in the right direction and, despite enormous opposition, the Australian company Austops, set up in Parkes, is doing very well. It is looking to expand because it has its order books full for two years. It is turning out a world-class product at better than world prices. We have leapfrogged the technology; we are now the best tops makers in the world. There was a very good article on Austops on page 2 of last Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>&mdash;for those of you who read the provincial press. It is industries such as this that are going to make wool Australia's largest single export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another category that should be considered is industries employing what I call Australia's native genius, Australia's intellectual property. Something that is a world beater that has been developed by Australians should be kept in Australia. I was privileged recently to look at a company in Western Australia, Merlin Engineering, where two brothers, Daryl and Ra Wheeler, have developed a unique product. It is a hydraulic motor which embodies the attributes of two different sorts of hydraulic motors. At the moment you can have a vane type hydraulic motor that gives you high speed but very little torque&mdash;a characteristic of all vane type motors&mdash;or you can have a motor which gives you enormous torque but very little speed. If you could marry those two properties, you would have something which is saleable in the world. This is exactly what the Wheeler brothers have done; they have developed a motor that combines the properties of both types: they have a positive displacement, high-speed hydraulic motor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ramifications of this are just enormous. With this technology we could grab hold of world leadership in trucks. The car industry has gone; we cannot go back there; it is too late. But we are a big user of trucks by world standards, and we are a user of big trucks by world standards. With this type of motor you can revolutionise truck design; you can make a motor by putting these motors in each wheel; you can make trucks safer, more reliable and cheaper because you do away with expensive gear boxes and transmission systems. They are safer because they include dynamic braking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the mining industry, they would be an enormous leap forward in Haulpaks. The honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) said that there are only two world-class players in Australia. Of course, that is not true. We are a world-class player in the mining industry generally. By world standards we are a big miner; we have the most efficient mines in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is needed to establish industries? Two factors are self-evident: a large customer and a state-of-the-art customer. In mining, of course we have both of those. Why then do we not have a manufacturing industry that services them? There is another imponderable but just as critical factor, which is government will. That is what is lacking in the establishment of a manufacturing industry to supply the mining industry in this nation. In fact, we are taking our management and our technology offshore; we are going to show Third World nations why we are the best miners. We are going to give them our knowledge&mdash;and then we will simply not be able to compete with their wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talk of value adding, but you cannot value add our mineral product very much, because the market is Asia, and Asia does not want value adding. Asia knows that value adding means jobs and it wants to do it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) in the debate on Working Nation and it is a pleasure to be able to agree with him. I will pick out three or four points that he made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found myself very much in the mould of the nationalists rather than the internationalists, because I believe that Australia has too much to offer to allow itself to be submerged by any other philosophy. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie touched on the media. This debate on the white paper deals with very fundamental issues about the direction Australia should take, and I suppose it is appropriate for me to say here that my great disappointment during the 12 months I have been in this job is the trivialisation of the issues by the media. There are only two or three people who can come to grips with the issues in a thorough way. It is a difficult task, but to me too often the media are looking for the entertainment value and thereby trivialise serious issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of the US underclass raised by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has always been of concern to me. Although I have great respect for the Americans and they are our great allies, we are Australians and we must always remain so. We have much to protect and much that we should not borrow from our US allies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of unemployment of the middle-aged, particularly during this decade, is a very sad indictment of this country. Long-term unemployment is very much an issue that has to be grappled with, and the point about self-esteem and the ability of the leader of the household to give leadership to that household is a very important one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were another two points made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that I enjoyed listening to. One was the matter of the Japanese example and the quite astronomical protection in that country. It is pleasing to see removal of some of those barriers, but we must not underestimate or trivialise the way that the Japanese have protected their own economy. The second point he made that I enjoyed related to wool. It is wonderful to hear someone so confident about wool. As a wool producer I got quite a lift out of that. Even I have not been so bullish about the wool market as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is, but it is a pleasure to hear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my contribution today to the debate on Working Nation, I want to talk about the ambitions of this country and the government's role in helping Australia to fulfil those ambitions. One of our most basic ambitions is to have a job, and we all know this is an ambition which for many is difficult to fulfil these days. The white paper purported to help us towards our ambitions for a job. However, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sent a clear message to regional Australia that it should not hold such lofty ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering questions on the white paper, the Prime Minister said there would always be an unemployment problem in country towns. I must inform the Prime Minister that in my country town the unemployment rate is actually less than two per cent. Sadly, that is not the case in many others. He simply accepted that problem as a fact because the government cannot bear to extend any creative thinking towards regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also spoke of the aim to have 2,000 people to administer the new one-on-one case management system for the long-term unemployed. The Prime Minister said he felt that this was ambitious, and appropriately ambitious. I think it would be appropriately ambitious for the Prime Minister to say, `Yes, we can give more jobs to the regional centres. Yes, we can develop jobs outside of urban Australia.' However, this seems to be an ambition which the Prime Minister does not think is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also referred to Kelty's task force and its consultations with regional Australia. The task force recommended that the regions be encouraged to help themselves and specifically that regional economic development boards be established. This is a clear demonstration of how little the government knows about regional Australia. We have had development boards for years now. What does the government think regional Australia has been doing? Does it think we have been sitting on our backsides waiting for the government to help us attract industry and investment to the regions? If we had waited for the government's support and assistance, the unemployment problem in regional Australia would be even worse than it is now. The main thrust of Working Nation's ambition for regional Australia has already been up and running. The government had nothing new to offer regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister also spoke of a need for regions to understand what they do best and focus on community objectives. Again, regions know very well what their focus should be, but their main problem is trying to get this government to take some notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can cite two simple examples in my own electorate of Grey. The first is that Whyalla is competing to have a titanium dioxide pigment plant established in the town, and the council and the community have been running a petition for government support by way of tax incentives. The council and I attempted for some weeks to have the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe), our Deputy Prime Minister, personally accept that petition. It took many weeks for the minister to reply. When the reply came, he said that it was a matter best referred to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). This is the kind of response that the regions find quite disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second example relates to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). Councils on Eyre Peninsula have been striving for some time to have the minister visit the area to look at the decline in their agricultural industries. Despite numerous representations&mdash;and I was assisted by my colleague Senator Ferguson in this matter&mdash;we have received no response at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government regards regional Australia as a foreign country. The government cannot jump on a plane and visit regional Australia. It takes a special effort or a special task force. The government has to get people like Kelty to bravely step out of the city and talk to those strange regional people. Like a foreign country, regional Australia is left on its own to create jobs and growth. I believe regions have to take the lead and develop their industries and create jobs. However, government clearly must contribute towards this. The contribution from the government so far is half-hearted at best. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper, which I have previously called `Training Nation' or `Stagnation', received its fair share of criticism, as you would expect in a vigorous democracy. Even before the release of the white paper, Richard Blandy of Melbourne University said that it would probably argue that restoring full employment was simply not feasible and that the term had even lost its meaning. This is true. Our standards and our ambitions for full employment are constantly falling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tragedy that the UN standard for measuring whether a person is in full-time employment is whether a person has worked for at least one hour&mdash;I repeat, one hour&mdash;the previous week. How on earth can one hour per week constitute full employment? The hole in the unemployment figures frustrates me and no doubt frustrates many others who are interested in the true number of unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is getting more and more difficult to ascertain the number of unemployed as the government moves people into the different training schemes or onto welfare benefits. That was the true aim of the white paper: to muddle the unemployment numbers again, to move people into training schemes and temporary jobs which only add up to a bandaid on the huge problem of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently spent time in the Pitjantjatjara lands in the north-west of my electorate. The similarities between the Aboriginal youth of those communities and the unemployed non-Aboriginal youth in the regional cities of my electorate were startling. Both groups are experiencing a kind of social dislocation. Both have all but given up looking for work. Both are involved in substance abuse. Both are involved in petty crime. They have similar habits: sleeping in and amusing themselves with recreational activities during the day, and roaming the streets or visiting pubs and clubs late into the night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These groups have built up a kinship and reliance on their friends. When one does not have any money, he or she can rely on the rest of the group until the government cheque comes through. These groups do not have a lot of faith in the institutions of our society. Many of them do not have a clue about the so-called work ethic. It simply is not part of their culture. The development of this new culture in Australia is a crisis that we all need to be aware of. It is a culture which this government has very much helped to create. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister claims that a decade of Labor has created one of the most sophisticated social democracies in the world. I do not think we have become sophisticated, but rather we have become so bland and so afraid that we have no solutions to unemployment and, as a result, we have no work ethics or standards to hand down to our younger generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this age of unemployment, how can we teach our youth what it means to have a job? In this age of reliance upon the government cheque, how can we teach our youth what independence means? Just look at their role models. Thousands of children are growing up in homes affected by unemployment. Countless children see their parents at home all day without work. This government says that it does not want two groups of Australians, the haves and the have-nots; however, there are clearly two groups at present, and these young people I spoke about represent one group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I want to turn to the matter of interest rates. There has been some discussion in the last week or so about rising interest rates. I took the trouble to get a few figures just before I came in here. The domestic debt&mdash;that is, the public, private and household debt&mdash;in Australia is about $600 billion. A one per cent interest rise on that comes out at about $6 billion. It is interesting that $6 billion is just the figure that the government has put into Working Nation over four years. The point I want to make there is the general point that the interest on our domestic debt, when it rises by one per cent, is $6 billion per annum. That staggered me and I was very surprised to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net foreign debt is $169 billion. Quite often we get a little lost in the hugeness of these numbers. I will never forget the headline some years ago when it was published on the front page of the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>. It made everyone just about turn off because it was too big a number to even contemplate. If we take a one per cent increase on this $169 billion net foreign debt&mdash;and we can talk about whether we take the loan long or short term, but most of this debt is short term and I think the numbers are still relevant&mdash;that would mean a $1.5 billion rise in costs to our domestic economy just through foreign debt. It is $6 billion to the domestic economy in terms of the domestic debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are winners and losers in that, but who is the main winner? I would suggest that one of the main winners is the government through taxation and the generation of revenue. So the government spends this $1.5 billion, and there we have, with all the activity of the $6 billion rise in interest rates, the government being the beneficiary. To me that is one of the very cynical exercises of this reliance on debt. Debt is used not only to provide those consumption items that people need to have, but also to generate revenue and help the government balance its books.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude with a quote about the unemployed from the Prime Minister. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not going to leave them in the lurch. We are going to put out our hand and pull them up behind us.</PARA>
<PARA>This Prime Minister, when he was Treasurer and now as Prime Minister, has been reaching back, he would have us believe, for 11 years; he has been reaching back and pulling people up for 11 years. And we still have nearly one million people unemployed. I just wonder how long it will be before the Prime Minister acknowledges that he has contributed much to unemployment in this country by the sort of interest rate regime that he has put in place. He has gone through this nonsense of painting us as uncaring when he has done more damage by this whole business of his interest rate regime and at the same time claiming that he is reaching down to help pull people up. I find it most hypocritical and, as a parliamentarian, I find that it demeans this place. </PARA>

We will develop best when our development springs from the inspiration and commitment of the people who live in their sense of place. The goal is to put Australia to work. The aim of the Working Nation paper is to set those goals, give direction to them. These are policies for economic and social strength. By employing our people we are economically and socially stronger. We know what we would like to happen in our town, in our farm, in our suburb and in our environment. As the Kelty and the McKinsey reports both revealed, there is inspiration and commitment in abundance. The task now is to harness our local strengths and ideas in a strategy which will enable those regions to grow strong economies and create employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we need to look inward to know who we are, what we can do, who has the skills and the best and the most efficient way of using them. Then we need to look beyond our regions and find niches in the mainstream markets in Australia and abroad. A lot of this has already been done and done at a local level. At the local government level in Tasmania, councils have been going through a dramatic reform process. Many have already been working on strategic plans, and changes in local government structures may have caused some upsets for traditional views. But they are honing down to this very important level to be much more efficient and effective organisations. We are beginning to participate in the modern Australia, to be part of the modern economy and thus reach out beyond our boundaries to the global economy. Each level must play a role. The Commonwealth is to provide strategic assistance of a kind that will enable the people of the regions to help themselves by investing in their own communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strengths and weaknesses of the regions mirror the problems that face Australia as a whole. The consequences of recession and restructuring in different degrees are the same, along with the social problems, so the solutions must be similar. A regional development strategy must apply to the regions the same principles and programs as the national strategy applies. Industry and trade policy, export programs and the removal of impediments to finance and investment are policies for the regions. Labour market programs, training and education, and reforms to social security are also policies for the regions. The proper aim of a regional development strategy is that the people of the regions can, by their own efforts and ideas, share in and contribute to the nation's future growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Lyons covers 61 per cent of the island state of Tasmania. Tasmania is seen as one region but is organised by various state and federal government policies as a series of subregions. Because of this, none of the regions functionally fits the Lyons electorate, making it difficult at times to assist in a strategic development. For example, most of the public servants live in the city, making it hard for many people to access them from remote country areas. Part of the federal government's assistance will be to ensure that those people can have the same advantages as the city people with access to programs and finance that can help them assist their region. It is aimed at helping people to think around problems, adopt new approaches and continue to develop promising old ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already there is evidence of Australians thinking smarter and across national boundaries. Remodelling old ideas, as mentioned in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> yesterday, is one such way. For example, Horizon Brewery has used the Mondragon cooperative model for its expansion process. The principles that the cooperative espoused have formed the basis of a successful 1990s style investment fund, where the investors have the final say in how the collective cash is managed and what types of investments are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key regional development infrastructure changes identified in Working Nation is the ability to look at different ways of raising funds and assisting small investors to invest in their own future and that of their children. The Horizon Fund is one such approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same paper yesterday there was another story about a new $40 million wool plant to be established, marking an Australian company's first major move into upstream processing&mdash;a move long overdue, in my opinion. This tops processing company has estimated that the local tops making capacity will nearly double by the end of next year to about 60,000 tonnes, and this is still less than 10 per cent of the world volume&mdash;there is still a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania, new markets are being identified; we are thinking beyond our traditional boundaries. I have been looking at the possibility of putting Tasmanian fine foods on the plates of Saudi Arabia&mdash;I spoke about it this morning on radio in Tasmania. One of the world's richest areas, which has a culture of entertaining its friends and visitors very lavishly, should look no further than Tasmania for its delicacies, such as salmon or asparagus or a bowl of strawberries. If we can establish links with Saudi Arabia, it is an easy jump to the other Arab states around Saudi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to think smarter and to help others to think beyond their state boundaries there is a need for the training that leads to developing new ideas. The Working Nation paper develops the theme of making sure our education and training are keeping up with all the other new developments; education and training are part of the overall strategic plan. Better skills promote better ways of doing things, and being more familiar with your region means new ideas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the government nor the public service must think that it is exempt from change. All must participate in the learning and the desire to assist others to learn.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening very carefully to the contributions by various members of the government on the subject of this very ironically entitled Working Nation paper. I am struck by the pious, self-serving, even smug set pieces which speakers have been delivering, in which each and every one of them has failed to address the fundamental structural problems of the economy and the way we work and produce goods in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no good speaker after speaker burying his or her head in the sand and thinking that the problems afflicting the nation which are causing high employment&mdash;a huge foreign debt and month after month of balance of payment deficits&mdash;will go away. Quite the opposite. Whilst the economy is in something of a boom&mdash;although it is arguable as to what extent&mdash;and there may be a succession of economic statistics apparently favourable to the government, the fact is that the cycle will turn and turn much quicker than any of us who have the interest of the nation at heart would want. We are caught on a boom-bust cycle, and the government, by its very failure to address the long-term problems of the country, is condemning the country to a continuation of the cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of the major issues that the government has squibbed on, to use a colloquialism. The first and most important, to my mind, is industrial relations. The cost of employing a person is prohibitive to small business and even medium-size business. And large business continues to shed labour, even in the face of improved economic data. The cost to business of employing people in this country is just too high, as high across the board as 40 per cent of the wage itself. For those 800,000 small businesses in Australia, the idea of employing a person, without a massive wage subsidy or under a training program as provided in some circumstances by the government, is fanciful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of managers, both in the public and private sector today, is measured by how many people they can lay off, so as to improve, firstly, productivity and, secondly, costings. It is a terrible state of affairs when the laying off of people automatically results in improved cash flow, profit and performance. There is something disastrously wrong with the industrial relations system in this country if you get badges of honour and promotion in large companies according to how many people you have managed to let go&mdash;whether by voluntary or involuntary redundancies&mdash;and in small business by how few people you can avoid putting on in the first place. There is something very immoral about that concept of labour. It is something that has beset this country for a very long time and, despite the mass of industrial relations legislation presented by the government in the past few weeks, nothing will be done to alleviate the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of labour can only increase under this government's laughably termed `industrial relations reform'. The inflexibility and rigidness of both the wage fixing system and the influence of the trade union movement in the workplaces will continue, if not worsen, unabated. That is what is so terribly important to understand. I do not think workers have for one moment benefited from this government. Real wages have demonstratively deteriorated over its 11 years in office. Rather, it is the inflexibility, it is the work practices, it is the demarcation separations, which are the disincentive to employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not represent the true and lasting interests of workers, as evidenced by the number of workers who have ended up in unemployment queues. The government also backs away from the hard questions of reform. We all remember, only a few days after the March 1993 election, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announcing, with all of the boasting and bravado for which he is known, an industrial relations revolution which would see genuine workplace reforms leading to bargaining between employers and employees who were genuinely able to strike their own arrangements. In the absence of that trust or that line of communication, the relevant trade union would represent the worker. He quickly backed away from it and, some 12 months later, we saw presented to this parliament the hopelessly complex, detailed and unworkable legislation which killed off reform and was drafted largely by the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the many amendments and suggestions we made to improve the legislation, it went through largely unchanged, thanks, as always, to the Australian Democrats in the Senate, who are always willing to do the Labor Party's bidding in some sort of trade-off for one of their weirder and more wonderful individual pursuits. And, of course, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has come back into the parliament seeking changes in an attempt to improve that initial legislation, which is an admission he got it wrong in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The power of the trade union movement to veto reform continues. Let me take as a very stark example the coal industry, for which I have responsibility as the opposition spokesman on resources and energy. The same Minister for Industrial Relations promised on 19 April 1994 that, once and for all, he would put an end to the renegade tactics of the United Mineworkers Union, which has conducted three strikes over the last nine months and has cost the coal industry&mdash;and, therefore, many ordinary Australians&mdash;hundreds of millions of dollars. He vowed to overcome, once and for all, the United Mineworkers Union's contempt&mdash;to use his words&mdash;for the decisions of the Coal Industry Tribunal, by bringing the Coal Industry Tribunal into the mainstream Industrial Relations Commission jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Coal Industry Tribunal is a total anachronism. It is an antiquated body which is separate and apart from the Industrial Relations Commission. It sits out there all by itself, having been established in 1948, when there was just a domestic industry; and now of course it is largely an export industry. The minister promised legislation, but the House rises tomorrow and there is no legislation on the table. Many weeks after the minister's commitment, there is no legislation in sight. Round 1 has gone to the United Mineworkers Union. It would come as no surprise to anybody on this side of the House if the United Mineworkers Union and its acolytes within the Labor Party here in the House eventually succeed in forcing the minister to totally capitulate and preserve the Coal Industry Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not in the interests of Australia, let alone of the workers whom the United Mineworkers Union seeks to represent, for the Coal Industry Tribunal to remain.

The industry has a mere 0.3 per cent of the nation's labour force, yet it accounts for 12 per cent of lost days because of industrial disputes. In 1993, when there was only the one national strike&mdash;there have been two national strikes in 1994; the Australian Bureau of Statistics has not yet caught up&mdash;the industry lost 3,288 days per 1,000 employees, because of industrial disruption. The all-industry average was 108 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coal industry, with this industry specific industrial relations system, the Coal Industry Tribunal, lost 3,288 days when the all-industry average was only 108 days. That says it all. The strikes and the actions of the United Mineworkers have disrupted markets and cost jobs, yet the government is paralysed. The Minister for Industrial Relations promised legislation to reform the coal industry and abolish the Coal Industry Tribunal but we have not seen the colour of his money, and I do not think you should be holding your breath while you wait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of quick points before my time expires. Continuing this theme of resources, I turn now to uranium. The Labor Party has got itself economically and philosophically in a complete knot over this issue. How can uranium mined from Roxby Downs in South Australia or Ranger in the Northern Territory be somehow cleaner, more moral than the uranium that lies untouched in the earth waiting to be mined but prevented from being mined by the government's three-mine policy? It is breathtaking hypocrisy by government members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They keep putting up this point that the market is saturated and that there is no economic return anyway. I do not accept that, looking at the economics of it, particularly as these proposed uranium mines need to come on stream to take advantage of the generally agreed upturn within two and three years from now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in any event, why should a government concern itself with the potential economics of the private sector? The principle is wrong. We do not make decisions in government to protect an industry from itself so long as, naturally, consumers or shareholders enjoy the protection of the law. There is no earthly reason, except for emotional and ideological obsessions, for this three-mine policy. It is disastrous for Australia's national interest and for many of the Aboriginal communities that want uranium mining to proceed. The left wing, together with segments of the trade union movement, is surely vetoing any rational assessment of this aspect of public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can continue with other examples of where the government has abysmally failed to address fundamental problems which affect Australians and stupidly hurt our capacity to provide jobs. The waterfront, cabotage and coastal shipping are all well-known areas. There has been inadequate reform across the board. The government can put up some initially impressive figures to show in various industries how there has been micro-economic reform, but they are hopelessly relative and meaningless as they are relative only to what has gone on before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, in comparison to our international competitors we can never release the foot from the accelerator of reform. We must day in and day out drive forward with common purpose between employees and employers for greater and better efficiencies and productivity. We are all in this together. Despite this simple fact, extremists within the trade union movement have inordinate power to impede and in some cases completely stop the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other areas of policy where the government can improve our economic performance and provide better jobs. However, we see the government unable to muster consensus within its own ranks on even the most simple and straightforward decisions, such as privatising ANL. That company is losing money hand over fist, particularly because of government indecision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So on all those matters&mdash;industrial relations, the coal industry, the uranium industry, the ports, coastal shipping and privatisation&mdash;this government has failed the vital test. The vital test is simply whether it is acting in the interest of all Australians, with the end objective of providing jobs. Sadly, the answer is no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend today to speak in detail on the fine points of the Working Nation white paper. This has already been done ably by my colleagues on this side on the House. What I intend to do is make some comment about the historical context of the white paper. I believe that Working Nation represents for the 21st century what the Chifley government's white paper of 1945 would have meant for postwar Australia if a Liberal government had not been elected in Australia in 1949.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is correct when he attributes much of Australia's economic problems of the 1990s to the sleepy 1950s. In that so-called postwar boom, a strategy, if you could call it a strategy, was implemented that in reality not only was disastrous relatively for the 1950s but laid the foundation for economic problems of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The Chifley government had developed its white paper on employment in the mid-1940s as part of a plan for postwar reconstruction which, if implemented, would have laid the foundation for planned and sustainable economic growth for Australia in the postwar environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That white paper emphasised the need for trade unions and business to work together, as well as all levels of government, including state and local government. The 1940s white paper also argued for an efficient Australia-wide employment service, which was to ensure mobility of labour, to develop training and to provide vital information concerning the labour market for the formulation of economic policy. Instead, the Menzies government, with the particular complicity of the then Country Party, simply allowed the entry of foreign corporations into the manufacturing sector and then protected them with tariff barriers. There was no planning and no forecasting. The beginnings of Australian manufacturing in the 1940s were overtaken by the gradual foreign acquisition of Australian manufacturing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much attention has been paid to the lack of support for Australian research and development in that period. Whilst the rhetoric of the Liberals was anti-union, the government, through the period of McCarthyism and the red scare of the 1950s, was quite happy to assist tame-cat unions. Basically the deal was that they accepted the economic status quo and concentrated solely on wage determination. Unfortunately, the enthusiasm for strategic planning of the 1940s waned. But the chickens came home to roost in the early 1970s. The nature of the international system began to change and the Australian economy was not adjusted to change. Such was the Menzies legacy. The indicative planning mechanisms used in Europe were absent in Australia. For many reasons, capital at that time became much more footloose and internationalised. In Australia, for various social and economic reasons, the participation rate of women in the work force escalated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some, though not a majority by any means, of the former less developed countries began to develop strategies to attract manufacturing away from OECD countries like Australia. Japan, of course, was the first and best at this. But particularly in countries other than Japan low wages and non-unionism were always the keystone of these strategies. Slowly the focus of world manufacturing shifted from the OECD to Japan and later to the Asian tigers, Taiwan, Thailand and South Korea, for example. Even the United States felt the pinch, despite the overall strength of the US economy. The Australian labour movement and the ALP grappled in the 1970s to find policy solutions for these changes. Some, like Gough Whitlam, sensed that tariffs and protection were part of the problem, so they saw the answer in the reduction of tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, the Liberals could not make up their minds about tariffs either in the 1960s. It was a big issue for the Liberals. It cost Billy McMahon the prime ministership for some time. They still had no policy except for McEwenism, which was simple&mdash;an ad hoc example of the early Menzies no-policy solution. Unemployment began to grow as manufacturing in Australia declined. Then we had the Fraser government, which had no policy answers at all. Nothing like a plan or strategy was adopted by the Fraser government. Malcolm Fraser simply blamed the trade unions, maintained the Whitlam level of tariffs and did nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1983, something clearly had to be done. The ALP went to the election that year with the accord as one of its major policy promises. The accord contained the seeds of the white paper which we are debating today. It revived the concept of strategic planning for growth and employment, which had not been part of policy since the white paper of the 1940s. With the accord, the trade unions, revitalised by the demise of NCC influences in the 1950s and 1960s, took up the baton that would have been taken up in the 1950s if Menzies were not Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unions turned their back on a simple focus on wages policy alone and focused on the role that they could play to improve Australia's industrial efficiency, not only to stave off the effects of de-industrialisation, but also to build up Australia's export capacity. However, the trade unions in Australia accepted the accord on the proviso that the Australian standard of living through the award system be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who preceded me in this debate, made the completely hypocritical statement that somehow real wages have not risen. In the last 10 years, Mr Deputy Speaker, do you remember any office holder of the coalition, any shadow spokesman, any opposition member, supporting a wage increase for workers in this country? I cannot. Every time the ACTU made a wage claim, what did we hear, either from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) or the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock)? They would say, `No, it is not the time,' and yet they have the hypocrisy to come into this place and talk about real wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobs were created in the early period of the Hawke government. The number of industrial disputes drastically declined. Though the accord process became more and more concerned with the wage fixation regime, the ACTU continued to call for a more strategic approach to industry planning. A document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Reconstructed</EMPHASIS> was produced by the officers of the ACTU. Again, that document contains some of the seeds of the white paper that is before the House today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay a tribute in particular here to someone who was vilified by the Fraser government, and that is Laurie Carmichael, who was one of the architects of that early policy. I do not think there is anyone in Australia who has the dedication that Laurie Carmichael has to the idea of the importance of training in Australia, and now what Laurie Carmichael is saying is orthodoxy, but when he was talking 10 years ago it was new and innovative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the Liberal Party of Australia rethink its policies of the 1950s and develop some sort of policy mechanism that included planning that had been practised 20 years before by its equivalent parties in Europe? No. What it did was to begin to mimic the policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. That is what it did. These policies were based simply on an attempt to destroy that earlier postwar compact I referred to between even tame-cat unions and the government over wages. It was an attempt to destroy the trade union movement, again merely mimicking the Asian tigers. However, that policy failed to halt industrial decline in those countries, and it may have even accelerated it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor in government is faced with the reality of the continuing global restructuring of the world economy and with the problem of unemployment, which is faced by all comparable nations. The problem of long-term unemployment is acute in Australia, as it is in other OECD countries. Long-term unemployment is one of the major focuses of this white paper. I think it was the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) who highlighted the fact that long-term unemployment is faced by older people in the community&mdash;middle aged people. We always talk about youth unemployment, but middle aged people who lose their jobs quite often find it hard to adjust and to retrain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure whether it is a matter for humour or whether it is just sad, but so often in this chamber government members make speeches on critical current issues and devote nearly all of their time to talking about what Robert Menzies was doing 30 years ago or what happened in this country 40 years ago. Whilst, obviously, some components of their speeches may be relevant, we are here to talk about what is happening in this country today, particularly what has happened in this country in the past 10 or 11 years, since the government has been in office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about Menzies, there are a couple of points to be made. One is that during the Menzies time we were actually living in a different world, and the whole globe was living in a different world. Whilst there are some things you want to compare, the reality is that it was a different world. But if you want to compare, the facts are these: unemployment was low; inflation was low; the standard of living of Australians was better compared with the rest of the world than it ever has been since; we did not have the international debt that we have under this government. So if we want to talk about Menzies, we have to accept that they were pretty good times for the times that they were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, that fact is always conveniently forgotten by those on the other side who, in the last 10 years, have managed to pretty well bankrupt this country. We now have an international debt of nearly $200 billion, and that is an absolutely phenomenal increase. We have seen a phenomenal rise in unemployment. In my electorate alone it has gone up by nearly 700 per cent in the lifetime of this Labor government. I think it is important that we recognise that there are lessons to be learned from history, but we can dwell too much on talking about what happened 30 years ago when we ought to be concentrating on what is happening now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here to debate the government's document, Working Nation. It is a fairly thick tome but, of course, it largely tries to disguise the realities of the situation because the government is not able to actually fix the problem. It is something of a non-event, it seems to me. I want to talk about a couple of aspects of this document, in particular the matters concerning Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;indigenous people. It is an area in which I have taken a particular interest in the four years since I have been here. I am also going to talk about the situation in my own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My electorate of Aston is an eastern suburbs seat in Melbourne, and it is an overwhelmingly young electorate. I have a lot of young people, and a lot of young people in this country today face the prospect of going through the school system, coming out of the education system at whatever stage and finding it very difficult to get jobs. This document offers more training by putting them on artificially contrived schemes and getting them off the unemployment lists for a few months, but it does not actually create jobs. That is really what, it seems to me, young people in my electorate are looking for. A lot of youngsters say to me, `What is the point of studying at school? What is the point of taking the HSC? What is the point of going to university because when I come out I cannot get a blooming job anyway?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a young electorate. I also have more mortgage payers than any other electorate in this country. My electorate is the mortgage belt of Australia, and we are seeing what the markets think of this sort of document and the budget that followed it a few days later. Interest rates are starting to go up. It is interesting that in my electorate two or three years ago, when interest rates went through the roof under this government, there was massive hardship, massive social dislocation. What we need to see, and what the government has failed to deliver this year, is some sort of savings policy, some incentive to get people to save, so that we do not have to start going overseas cap in hand and borrowing overseas money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People want to see, and the many hundreds&mdash;in fact, 6,000-odd small businesses in my electorate want to see&mdash;some investment incentives to give them some assistance in terms of updating their business and starting to let them be more efficient in the way they do things so they can compete with imports and compete successfully overseas. The 6,000-odd small businesses in my electorate want to see less paperwork for the government. At the moment most small businesses in this country spend an absolute fortune on government paper and regulations. That needs to be significantly reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the small businesses in my electorate want to see a reduction in taxes, particularly the taxes that are charged on business products and those products that are going to go overseas, so that they can be more successful. Most small businesses in my electorate want to see more flexibility in the industrial relations field, because if they can have the flexibility, then, of course, they are going to be able to employ more people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those sorts of incentives were provided for small businesses rather than artificially contrived job creation or training schemes, those small businesses would be better able to hire more people. There are about 800,000 small businesses in this country. If each one of those businesses took on one extra person there would not be an unemployment problem in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are young people being trained for? The disillusion is very real. What about the women who are increasingly looking for jobs these days? We have a whole new social revolution. That is not addressed in this document. I agree with the previous speaker's comments in regard to the mature aged unemployed. We often forget that the mature aged do not get the publicity in the current unemployment situation. A mature aged bread winner is often by definition the sole income earner of the family. For a man 45 to 50 years of age who has perhaps worked for the same company for 20, 25 or 30 years and is retrenched it is not easy to retrain. Often the sorts of jobs that he can go for are the jobs that are disappearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He goes home and he has the indignity of having to tell his children that he cannot get a job, that he cannot support them, that he has to go on the dole. His and his family's lifestyle have to be curtailed. There is the worry and stress that go with that and the prospect that perhaps he will never work again, even though he was promised an upturn in the economy a few years down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the long-term unemployed it seems to me we are in severe danger of creating in this country, as has happened in other countries, an underclass and the social consequences that come with that of crime, substance abuse and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whether we are talking about the young, about women, about the mature aged unemployed or about the long-term unemployed, this document does not do the things that are necessary to actually create jobs. Working Nation does not address the issues. It hides the number of unemployed under other headings. It provides training but not the jobs. Let me quote the Australian Youth Policy in Action Coalition, which quite correctly says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The white paper produces training but not jobs for young people. Labor can take the first step, money for training, but it does not know what to do after that.</PARA>
<PARA>The Labor government can always find more ways of increasing taxes, and it is increasing taxes. We have not had the promised tax cuts. We are raising more revenue from tax both directly and indirectly as a result of the current budget. It can always raise more money from the taxpayer but it cannot follow through with jobs for young people. It does not deal with the other issues affecting labour costs, such as the restrictive award provisions which will continue to inhibit the capacity of business to grow and provide more jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Businesses, particularly those smaller enterprises that I was referring to, are also concerned about the new industrial relations regulations and provisions relating to termination which we have seen in this place in the last week or so. If a prospective employer is concerned that if he hires somebody he cannot get rid of them if they do not perform, that is obviously going to discourage that employer from hiring in the first place. So it has become a positive inhibitor to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is becoming more and more unattractive for employers to provide permanent full-time employment. We have seen that over the past 10 years. The percentage of casual employees in the workplace has risen from around 15 per cent to well over 20 per cent. The question has been asked: why does the `training wage' have to be subsidised by taxpayers rather than being able to be determined by negotiation between employers and employees, at no cost to the taxpayer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the accord protects the status quo. Rather than allowing some flexibility whereby the unemployed can negotiate directly with an employer, it takes away the bargaining power of the unemployed. It is this fundamental inflexibility in our working arrangements in this country which discriminates very specifically against those who are unemployed at the moment. But that is the accord; it protects those who already have jobs but does not look after those who do not have jobs. The government's attitude is to throw money at the problem but not fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another example of rhetoric is trying to improve employment for indigenous people but not actually succeeding. There has been a lot of big trumpeting around the country that the 1991 census showed a drop of 4.5 per cent in unemployment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. However, we must recognise that those Aboriginal people are still almost three times as likely to be unemployed as a member of the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not highlight the fact that up to 70 per cent of all unemployed indigenous Australians have been without a job for more than 12 months compared with 46 per cent of unemployed people in the broader community. Nor does the government highlight the fact that the average income for indigenous Australians has declined. Nor does the government draw attention to the fact that the overall employment situation for young indigenous men living in towns and cities has worsened. Nor does it admit that there is no evidence that there has been any reduction in the overall dependence of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The major strategy to addressing the severe unemployment problem in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community is the community development employment program, or CDEP. This is a work for the dole scheme. I and the coalition support it as a concept. I believe that it could be extended to other parts of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's funding&mdash;$234 million in 1992-93, or 26 per cent of its budget&mdash;is expended in the CDEP scheme. We should also acknowledge that a significant proportion of that money&mdash;over 60 per cent&mdash;is offset and clawed back by the government against social security payments, giving only a net cost to the government of about $93 million. So it is all a conjuring trick. We are spending this large amount of money here but we are taking it back there. What we are actually spending to try to deal with these issues is much less than what the government would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Even more important is the wider context of addressing the tragedy of unemployment in the indigenous community. The government trumpets a success in employment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It talks about the 22,000 people who are employed under the CDEP. In reality, that hides the true level of unemployment, because they are not real jobs. It is a useful, constructive scheme, but it does not provide real jobs. It does not provide a long-term answer. Whilst we certainly support the CDEP, it has to be understood for what it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no forward path from the CDEP scheme. There is no method of getting further long-term sustainable economic jobs. This year, the government has cut back on the money that it has allocated to the Commercial Development Corporation in ATSIC to try to provide those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is all there in the ATSIC review of the employment policy for indigenous Australians, which is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The review of the Aboriginal employment development policy</EMPHASIS>. In fact, the government should have read that review before dreaming up its token section in the white paper in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In this document&mdash;time precludes me from reading it&mdash;there are four meagre dot points. The point is that over 90 per cent of the money it is offering will not be there this year. Over 80 per cent of it will not be there until after the next election. There is a net $28 million in it of which $3 million will be spent this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is offering to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is a con. The AEDP review lists 59 firm recommendations which could have been put into effect to create some real jobs. It seems to me that this document is a sham and a fraud. It will not do the job. The government ought to hang its head in shame. There is no question that at the next election the people will deliver their verdict with a thump. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was remarkably restrained throughout his whole speech, as was the Assistant Treasurer. I want to turn to some comments that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) made. I understand that the honourable member for Gippsland is now the opposition's resource spokesperson. Two weeks ago in this chamber he did not make a bad speech, especially for the honourable member for Gippsland, on the coal industry. After the speech I congratulated him on it. I rang a few of my friends in the miners federation and said, `He is learning a little and he did not make a bad speech. I think you should go and talk to him.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today he returned to the old National Party `kick a head' speech. He was talking about the Coal Industry Tribunal, which there is debate on at the moment, and he was talking about the number of days lost. I do not know where the honourable member for Gippsland gets his figures from. His figures are most certainly very different from mine. I would suggest&mdash;I do this in a spirit of friendship with the honourable member for Gippsland&mdash;that he goes and talks to the federation instead of just talking to the coal producers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a coalmining area. I will go down a coalmine with him in my area on the south coast. I will arrange for him to meet with the leadership of the miners federation. I think he would learn a little and it would save him the embarrassment of coming into this House and constantly trotting out this nonsense about the coalmining industry. He just displays his ignorance in this area. He is not an unintelligent person, although he tries to disguise it. I am sure that, if he came down and had a meeting with me and the miners federation, we would put him right on some of these areas. I know he is keen to learn, and we will do our best to assist in his education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then further compounded his ignorance and displayed his lack of knowledge to the House by bringing up the question of cabotage again. The issue of cabotage is very interesting. There are very few countries in the world that do not have cabotage. We will maintain cabotage in this country, as we should, and why should we not? I will tell honourable members why we will maintain cabotage. Two tankers have gone down off the South African coast in the last couple of days. The coast around Cape Town is being polluted with oil.

I am delighted that the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) is now in the chamber because, if I have time, I have a few comments to make about his contribution the other day. The opposition wants to introduce to the Australian coast ships such as those which are polluting the South African coast at this very moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said time and time again in this chamber, the shipping lane for most of our shipping is through our premier tourist resort, the Great Barrier Reef. The opposition, I am sure, will not be satisfied until it sees the Great Barrier Reef, our premier tourist resort, awash with oil. And it will be awash with oil unless we stop these ships of shame, these rust buckets that are trundling up and down the coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you of all people know this because you represent the Illawarra area, as I do. We see the ships that come into Port Kembla. You have been with me to inspect some of these ships which are in a disgraceful condition. They go up and down the Australian coast, mainly from our area, taking coal to Japan. If one of those ships were to go down&mdash;it is the bilge that would do the damage there&mdash;it would create irreparable damage to the Australian coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the honourable member for Gippsland talking about selling off ANL. As I said in this chamber on Monday, opposition members have those cheap flags, made in Taiwan, on each of their desks as some sort of nationalistic thing. If they are so keen to have the Australian flag fluttering, or rather limply sitting, on their desks, why are they so ashamed to see the Australian flag on Australian ships? That is the question they have to ask themselves. They come in here and talk about the Australian flag, wrap themselves in the Australian flag and display it on their desks, yet they do not want to see the Australian flag on Australian shipping. While ever I am in this chamber I will argue for Australian flagged and crewed shipping sailing under Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Wannon in his contribution made much of port charges. He very cleverly avoided saying that I had a briefing last week with representatives of the Australian shipping industry. I was not the only member there. Also there was the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville), the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) and the honourable member for Sturt (Mr Pyne), who are all from the opposition side of the chamber. Representatives of the Australian shipping industry in Sydney raised with us the cost of Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major increase in costs at Australian ports over the last few years has been in port charges. Who imposes port charges? The honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp) would know. It is not the federal government that imposes port charges. It is the state government. Of what political persuasion are those state governments? What happens to be the political persuasion of the state governments in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia or Western Australia? If one wants to find the culprit for increasing port charges, one should not look to the federal government; one should look to the state governments, who actually impose the port charges. That is where the cost comes from. It does not come from us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own personal view is that we actually should take over the ports, but I doubt that I would get a lot of support in that line. So all I am asking is that when members of the opposition come in here and want to debate these things, especially as it refers to the Coal Industry Tribunal, as it refers to shipping or as it refers to cabotage, they have a little bit of honesty in what they are saying. When some of the claims that have been made are investigated, it is found that there is no substance there at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition has its way and cabotage is abolished in this country, and if the rust buckets of the world are permitted to go up and down the Australian coastline, eventually someone will pay a tremendous cost. It will probably be the taxpayers of Australia as it is in South Africa. A clean-up will now have to go on around Cape Town because these ships have gone down. The taxpayer there will have to pay for that, as indeed in Australia it will be the taxpayer who will have to pay when one of these rust buckets inevitably goes down, which it will. </PARA>

He is one of the architects of the system, and what is he doing? He is championing a federal industrial relations agreement. Obviously, he does not believe that Victorian laws are as good as ours when it comes to flexibility and agreement making.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In less than two years, the cries of dissent from Victoria have become one great chorus. Only last week, another 10,000 Victorian workers&mdash;this time the state's independent schoolteachers&mdash;gave up and joined the federal system. Even the minister concerned, Phil Gude, was proposing to change his legislation late last year. We know that and the press of Victoria know that. He would have changed it were it not for the fact that he was overruled by none other than Jeff Kennett at the very last moment. Now we have the head of Victoria's Employee Relations Commission&mdash;the body created by Greg John, Phil Gude and Premier Kennett&mdash;adding her voice to all the other voices in saying to the Victorian government that its laws are unjust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her annual report the commission president, the appointee of the Victorian government, Susan Zeitz, has told the government that its own legislation should be changed. She has pointed to federal and New South Wales industrial relations laws for inspiration. Mr Gude has admitted to the press that he has had that report on his desk for some weeks, but he is refusing to table it in the state parliament. He does not want us to know what is in it. That is the truth of it. I will give the House just a flavour of what is in the report; I quote one paragraph from page 5. President Zeitz said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of any provision for the independent scrutiny of individual and collective employment agreements, other than for the purpose of enforcement, is a matter of concern. It is appropriate that there be a mechanism for scrutiny of such agreements and for the ability to intervene and vary such agreements where it is established that they breach minimum requirements or that they are otherwise unfair.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the creation of the Victorian government telling the Victorian government that the law does not work and saying it should be changed. How much more evidence does Victoria need? Already several hundred thousand Victorian workers, many of them with the full cooperation of their employers, have fled the Victorian IR system and now come under federal awards. Today it has been reported in the papers in Victoria that the Victorian government will challenge its own employee relations commission to overturn a decision brought down by that commission which reintroduced a limited form of compulsory arbitration. The Victorian government should cash in its chips and surrender now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. Honourable members may be aware that this weekend Melbourne University will host an important international conference of women in agriculture&mdash;the first conference of this type to be held. The organisers of this conference contacted my office about a fortnight ago concerning a particular problem they perceived where women, particularly women working on family farms, are disadvantaged in the way in which the law of compensation operates in terms of personal injuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has long been the case that someone who suffers an injury at work can receive compensation, not only for the pain and suffering resulting from the negligence but also for specific economic loss. While the law has long recognised that someone experiencing the benefit of unpaid labour can be compensated for the loss of that unpaid labour, persons actually performing unpaid labour have not been so easily compensated by our legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of particular interest to women working on farms, as often such women will not be partners in a formal legal sense. Nonetheless, they are making an enormous contribution to the maintenance of the property and the earning of income. Yet our legal system, it is claimed, does not properly recognise this contribution. In response to this request, I have referred the issue of compensation for unpaid labour, which applies in a broader set of circumstances than on Australian farms, to the Australian Law Reform Commission. The commission has told me that it will consider the issue in the second part of its important inquiry into equality before the law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case there is any confusion, those opposite should understand this: we are undertaking a due diligence process in order that the full facts of ANL's performance can be carefully considered during the remainder of this year with a view to doing everything we can to achieve our objectives. Let me restate those objectives. They are to see a strong presence from ANL as an Australian owned and Australian flagged company operating with Australian crews under Australian award conditions. In order to do this, we have to guarantee that the company itself has a sound financial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has never shirked its responsibilities in tackling the capital requirements of ANL. Let it not be forgotten that in 1983 we inherited the run-down shell of a company which was completely bankrupted. It was the Hawke Labor government that injected a total of $160.5 million into that company as a debt for equity swap and as a cash injection to prop up ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that it is a matter of concern that we want ANL to perform a lot better. Posting successive losses, as it has in its annual reports&mdash;audited by the Auditor-General and presented to this parliament since its incorporation in 1989&mdash;is of concern to the government, as is its performance this year. As the House should be aware that, rather than a $5 million loss for the whole year, as at the end of March it was projecting a loss of some $16 million; that is, a consolidated loss for the first nine months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. The question of poverty and inequality is a very important one, about which we have seen some comment and debate in recent times. A variety of observations have been made by the opposition. We had an MPI debate a couple of weeks ago. As I said at the time, the issue is inherently complex. It is not sufficient to simply look at cash incomes when making judgments about people's material wellbeing. A range of factors, including cash earnings, have to be taken into account. You have to look at social security transfers and the provision of goods and services, such as medical services and education services, by government. You have to look at the asset holdings of various categories of people, the amount of benefit that they derive from holding those assets and so forth. It is a fairly complicated issue.

Material affluence was at an all-time high. Australia was not the world-leader in equality, but it still ranked around the middle of the dozen most equal countries in the world.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a world-leader when it comes to social mobility; that is, both privilege and disadvantage are less likely to be inherited in Australia than in any other country. There is disadvantage, of course, but one of our more positive findings is that disadvantage in one aspect of life is often offset by advantages elsewhere. For instance, the aged in Australia do not rank high in terms of income. However, they do rank high in terms of home-ownership, and in other material comforts.</PARA>

<PARA>I think that puts into some sort of perspective the comments of the Leader of the Opposition and other opposition spokespersons. While professing tremendous patriotic fervour, they do their level best on every possible occasion to run down this country and portray it as the worst of all. Despite the difficulties of the recent recession, this remains one of the best and most equitable countries in which to live in the world. That fact has to be underlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion that I just quoted and the comments that I made earlier highlight the importance of getting more comprehensive and meaningful measures of material wellbeing. This is particularly important from the point of view of the social security portfolio, where we have to make judgments about the adequacy of payments and the relative priority that we give to improving different categories of payments. As a consequence of that, I have asked my department to embark on a substantial project to look at ways in which we can get more meaningful and conceptually sound indices of material wellbeing. I expect that that project will produce some very useful results in forming our efforts to further improve the adequacy of our social security safety net.</PARA>

Yesterday your colleague the Treasurer advised that superannuation guarantee collections to an aggregate of $1,200 would be untaxed and administered by the ATO without cost to the investor. He went on to say that the contributions would be invested in government instruments with the interest being applied to offset the cost of collection operations. From a consumer affairs perspective, do not these two positions represent a contradiction in terms? Further, given the parlous state of the ATO's Child Support Agency operations and given the track record of the existing super funds in the treatment of consumers, can the government guarantee that the interest component will cover such collection operations?

I am very pleased that on 10 June&mdash;along with the honourable member for Jagajaga, the honourable member for Scullin and the Victorian health minister, Marie Tehan&mdash;we announced an agreement in principle of the integration of the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital with the state public hospital system. I am sure that members of the opposition, particularly those from Melbourne and other areas of Victoria, would be interested in this matter. It might save them a lot of stamps and it might save me a lot of time replying to them by mail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integration of the hospital with the state system should take place, all being well, on 1 January 1995. The agreement that has been negotiated with the state will guarantee the hospital's future as an acute care teaching hospital. At one stage, it was a bit touch and go as to whether the state would take it but, at the end of the day, after a lengthy period of negotiations and very constructive consultations, it represented a very positive outcome, not only for the 81,000 entitled veterans and dependants in Victoria, but also from the approximately 2,000 staff at that hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that we were able to obtain from the Victorian government a series of undertakings which safeguard the special needs and requirements of the veteran community, including the retention of some of their special services such as the rehabilitation work group, the psychiatric and psycho-geriatric service at the hospital, as well as representations from the veteran community on the hospital's board of management. There is also a preparedness to keep and maintain the chapel, the memorial rose garden and the Gallipoli garden, and to ensure that they remain accessible to veterans. Integration will ensure that the Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital can continue to serve veterans, war widows and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state health system will receive a payment from the Commonwealth government of more than $500 million over four years to guarantee the rights of veterans to access high quality services in Victorian hospitals&mdash;plus, of course, we have given them the hospital.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still a number of matters that have to be negotiated during this next six-month period. There are a few important, sensitive matters, such as industrial issues et cetera, but I think that they can all be overcome.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the bottom line is that the government will continue to be responsible for the health and wellbeing of the 81,000 or so Victorian veterans, war widows and other entitled people.

To that effect, the Disability Discrimination Act is an important piece of legislation. The act, of course, is based upon the premise that much good can be done not simply by litigation but also by education and conciliation. When the act was brought into place, the government committed itself to a process of ensuring that there were appropriately funded bodies to enable people to have access to the remedies that the act provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To that effect, we entered into consultations with all the interested disability groups, including the HIV/AIDS peak organisations, the disability peak organisations and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Their recommendation was that the best vehicle for providing this assistance was through the community legal centre movement, which is a very flexible community-based organisation, which would enable us to provide direct representation across the country in a most cost-efficient way. We have committed ourselves to providing $750,000 per annum to advocacy support services to make sure that the act is available to the community and is made effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as the direct representation that can be had through accessing community legal centres, we will be sponsoring the production of educational material firstly to ensure that those working in the sector have simple and accessible explanations of the act and how it can be best utilised and secondly so that those who wish to provide direct personal representation can have as clear information as to the act as possible. We will be making that information available in a variety of forms, including braille, sound recording, computer disk forms and the like, so that the disabled community can have access to the important information that will be provided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He does indeed. He grievously misrepresents the road funding position of this government. Rather than any halving of funds for roads, this government has maintained and indeed made a huge contribution to the national highway system whilst at the same time untying formerly tied grants to both the states and to local government. So to the honourable member's figure of $820 million for national highway construction must be added $350 million, which just happens to be the value of the now untied grants to the states, as well as an additional sum of $326 million which is being paid as untied grants to local government.

Since we untied the road funds, the states have been siphoning off funds from roads and putting them into consolidated revenue. This year, $52 million of federal funds earmarked for roads have been siphoned off by the honourable member's political confreres in New South Wales. They are the people who have been robbing road construction in that state. They are the people who are responsible for his electorate not getting its fair share of road funding.

Immediately after initial reports on that, they will have seen people associated with the bond markets in Australia pointing out how changes to the interest rates in the long-term bond market here are a product entirely of movement elsewhere and not addressing the fundamentals in the Australian economy. They will then have seen as a coda to each of these stories, rather like a John Clarke interview, some spokesperson for the opposition&mdash;either the leader or deputy leader&mdash;effectively barracking for bond market interest rate rises against ordinary home owners and small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The oddity of that presentation, like a John Clarke interview, is matched only by the ignorance of the way in which their propositions are put.

They fundamentally conduct the economic debate between themselves in the lingo of 1930s economic debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed recently that their quaint nomenclature in the economic debate is now exceeded only by their ignorance of movements in interest rates domestically. For example, today the opposition leader earned himself the ire of Westpac by totally misrepresenting the position of Westpac on fixed interest loans.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the statement to them that they ought to worry is a mischievous statement. A mischievous statement implies motive. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition's motive was not that people should necessarily take to the trenches as a result of what he had to say; in this case, his defence on motive has to be ignorance. It can be only that, because he has intervened in economic discussion in this country on this basis since he took over the position of leader. It is a case of all once over lightly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that this will be of particular interest to the opposition's own smoking gun, the member for Mackellar. I am very pleased to have this timely question from the honourable member for Fowler. Only last week I again experienced first-hand the discomfort caused by smoking on international flights. We all know that that discomfort is greatly accentuated by the enclosed environment of an aircraft cabin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I inform the House today that I am pressing the management of both Qantas and Ansett for the extension of smoking bans to their international flights. I am sure that this will be a move welcomed by the travelling public and, indeed, warmly welcomed by the airline staff of both Qantas and Ansett. The government has acted and shown leadership in the past on the question of smoking bans. We banned smoking on all domestic flights within Australia in 1987 and we extended those bans to all services operated by international carriers between airports within Australia from October 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has continued to be at the forefront of focusing international attention on this very issue. At the 1992 International Civil Aviation Organisation assembly it was Australia that took a leading role as sponsor of the motion urging member countries to progressively restrict smoking on aircraft and to implement a complete ban by 1 July 1996. That motion was, of course, passed. Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US are now in the very final stages of concluding an agreement to ban smoking on non-stop flights between these four countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia supports these agreements being open to adoption by other countries. This will be the very first multilateral response to the ICAO resolution. In approaching Australian international carriers I look forward to further cooperation from the airlines in this very important area of public health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, yesterday a major report to government entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the structure of nursing home funding arrangements, stage two</EMPHASIS> was released from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health. I ask: what is the propriety of a major report to government being released outside the parliament when the parliament is in fact sitting? What privilege does that document attract if it is not actually released in the House or the Senate? Does it mean that people who give evidence to that inquiry are compromised in that they are not covered by parliamentary privilege? Will you request that the government ensure that major statements are actually tabled in this House in accordance with normal precedence?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that the honourable member has raised involved issues concerning a series of events which commenced with the appointment of the officer so named in 1989, and highlighted an anomaly in the Public Service Act in relation to SES equivalent officers of the parliamentary departments, I am advised. Following extensive preparatory work, the case was settled out of court, as the honourable member indicated, on the advice of the Australian Government Solicitor's office and counsel briefed by the Australian Government Solicitor's office. Payment to the plaintiff has been made and all costs disbursed by the Department of the Parliamentary Library. In total the payment amounted to $99,637.17. An amount of $6,122.91 was recovered from the officer for payment of debts to the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise with you, if I may, a question relating to the Parliamentary Library. I recognise that the library has entered into an arrangement with your consent, and I think on the recommendation of the Library Committee, that it close at 10 p.m. On occasions, however, by dint of decision of the government, the House sits beyond 10 p.m., as happened last night. There were a few of us who wanted to access material for the debate that was to come on in the House and we were unable so to do because the library had closed. It is a most unusual situation for the library to be closed when the House is actually sitting. Could you and/or the Library Committee look at examining the possibility of the library remaining open when the House sits on beyond the normal time?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was aware that the honourable member for Kooyong did experience some difficulties last night and I have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with the Parliamentary Librarian. As he points out, the decisions taken about closing hours have been the subject of ongoing discussion between the Library Committee, the presiding officers and staff of the library. It is appropriate, I think, that the closing times be reviewed when there is a clear indication as to when parliament is to be sitting, but I am sure the honourable member for Kooyong will appreciate that the circumstances of yesterday&mdash;I think the government introduced a suspension motion to the House only yesterday&mdash;meant that there was some uncertainty as to the actual closing time of the parliament, not only for last night but also for the remaining session. The point you have made is one worthy of consideration and I undertake that the Library Committee will have a look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is about aged care. For the benefit of honourable members, let me paint the picture. Everyone knows that our aged population is increasing. Today 11.1 per cent of Australia's population are over 65 years of age. That is over 1.8 million Australians. Twenty years ago that figure was 7.8 per cent of the population. In the year 2021, the year I turn 65, our aged population will peak at 15.6 per cent of the population. Of those 1.8 million Australians, 90 per cent still live at home, 84 per cent are independent and six per cent need formal care in their homes. Of the other 10 per cent, three per cent live in supported housing, 2 1/2 per cent in hostels and 4 1/2 per cent in nursing homes. That means that 75,000 Australians are living in 1,400 nursing homes. That is about 10 for every honourable member's electorate. Of the nursing homes, half are private, three-eighths are voluntary and one-eighth are run by state government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this matter of public importance I will be talking about the problems that nursing homes are facing and why they are facing those problems. I will also talk about dementia. I raised a question to the Speaker earlier about a report tabled yesterday. This is a major report by Professor Bob Gregory into the funding requirements of nursing homes. It was not released in the normal way. It was not tabled in this House, let alone subject to a ministerial statement or the opportunity for debate. It was released from the office of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence). When we look at the report we can understand why the government tried to sneak it out without much attention. It is a damning indictment of a lack of care of Australia's frail and vulnerable aged. I will read verbatim from the report. It found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need for substantial improvement in nursing home buildings around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the Government's funding formula, there is a complete lack of any incentive to maintain good quality nursing home stock.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Gregory got the Australian Valuations Office to do a survey of structural and design faults in nursing homes. The biggest single fault he found was that for people with wheelchairs or frames&mdash;and that is a lot of our frail elderly&mdash;the toilets were too small for them to be helped. Of the 75,000 Australians in nursing homes, 12 per cent&mdash;or about 10,000&mdash;live in rooms with five or more beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory found that the present funding system is not providing sufficient funds and is not attracting applications necessary for the placement and upgrading of nursing homes. He also found that, across the whole of the voluntary sector, if we are going to replace our nursing homes every 40 years&mdash;and many people would consider that far too long&mdash;we will have to find 670 new beds every year. Professor Gregory found that in the last eight years not once has that number of beds been found. In fact, we have come within cooee of it only once in eight years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is it happening? Nursing home funding is not easy to understand. You have to understand CAM, SAM and OCRE. CAM&mdash;the care aggregated module&mdash;is what they pay for care. It looks after nursing staff and the physical help that a patient gets. SAM is the structural component of it and includes knives, forks, tables, power, buildings and carpets. OCRE is other costs. CAM works okay and OCRE work okay, but there are serious problems with the structural component of nursing home funding that have consistently been acknowledged and consistently failed to have been acted on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bob Gregory found that, in the calculations the government uses to pay for its nursing homes, there is no provision for replacement of those nursing homes. That is why they are literally falling down. Bob Gregory found that, if you wanted to bring our nursing homes up to the standard required of current design and safety standards, you would need $540 million to $1 billion. Also in the calculations there is no provision for return on investment. Three years ago, a report showed that you would require $1.56 per patient per day to bring that structural component up to a reasonable level. That was acknowledged by the former minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), and it has not been acted on. Instead we have had delaying tactics&mdash;Gregory No. 1, Gregory No. 2 and now a round of consultations just to do what everyone knows needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next thing that has not been acted on is the differences between states. Victoria has the lowest number of nursing homes as a percentage when you look at the ratio of its elderly population to that of any other state of Australia. It is not surprising because Victoria has the highest cost structure of any state in Australia. In fact, you would need $1.11 per patient per day just to compensate Victoria for the average of the whole of Australia. Power and water costs more and there is a different structure of ownership of nursing homes&mdash;there is far more rented accommodation. Again, the former minister acknowledges this. Bob Gregory talks about this and nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One dollar and fifty-six cents a day or $1.11 a day does not sound like much, but $1.11 per patient per day works out to $22,000 every year for the average nursing home in Victoria. That is why people are looking to quit the industry, that is why the buildings are falling down and that is why the standard of the structures needs to be dramatically improved. As well, the government has changed the funding formula for replacing nursing homes. It used to be that the government would fund two-thirds of replacement costs and the industry would replace one-third. That worked. In 1991 the government changed it so that it provided one-third of the cost. The net effect of that has been that replacement has not occurred. Bob Gregory said that of 210 applications last year&mdash;15 per cent of nursing homes wanted to upgrade&mdash;seven went ahead. Not seven per cent&mdash;seven nursing homes in Australia. People want to do it but they cannot afford to do it. They are completely unable to do it. I will read to honourable members a letter from Ashleigh Lodge in Brighton, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The proprietors refer to what they cannot afford to do and to their patients. The proprietors of Ashleigh Lodge were thinking of quitting the industry. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot afford the following:</PARA>

<PARA>The second matter I want to raise in this matter of public importance is dementia. Of the 1.8 million Australians who are over 65 years of age, four to five per cent will have serious dementia. Brian Burdekin looked at this in his report on human rights and mental illness. I will read some of his findings. Approximately 3,000 Australians with dementia are still confined to psychiatric wards. I will talk about one of those in a moment. He found that inadequate support services in the community are forcing older people unnecessarily into institutional care. He found that outdated, inappropriate design and funding arrangements for nursing homes result in some residents with dementia being chemically constrained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are eight dementia specific units in Australia. One of them, Strathdon Community Lodge, is in my electorate. Strathdon lodge, which is run by the Uniting Church, is likely to close within the next two months. It is the standard setter for Australia. Next month, a delegation from Russia will visit the lodge to see the best in the country. The Uniting Church can no longer afford the drain on resources to keep it open. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you about two people I met last week at Strathdon lodge. The first person is called Gertie. She is 80 years of age. She has been at the lodge since April 1983. Prior to that, she lived in a large psychiatric hospital. She had been there for 53 years. Her life was spent in a dormitory style ward, with up to 20 beds. She had not spoken for years. She shared communal facilities with very disturbed people. Her family would often find her curled up in the foetal position on a chair. She was completely resistant to approaches from staff or family. Her only emotion was aggression when anyone tried to help her with personal care or hygiene. She had worn communal clothes and had not worn underwear since she was 26 years old. She was being medicated twice a day to sedate her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Gertie is a dignified lady, wearing her own clothes and taking pride in herself. She has started to speak again. She takes part in the activities of the lodge. She loves music and dancing. The point is that she was being cared for in far more expensive and completely inappropriate facilities. Her care today is much cheaper. That is the change in her. Where will she go when Strathdon closes? I imagine she will go back to the psychiatric hospital. Do not be shocked. Brian Burdekin tells us that there are 3,000 others with her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week I met another lady named Toni. She is 88 years of age. Previously she was in a nursing home, costing the government $102 a day. In the nursing home she was frequently found weeping. She frequently wandered aimlessly looking for something to do. She followed the nursing staff round, asking for her belongings and wanting to go home. Overnight she would not settle. She was sedated every night because she was constantly up and down. She would rummage through other people's rooms, which caused confrontation and fights the whole time. The staff coped only by drugging her. She has been in Strathdon three months. She no longer walks aimlessly. She no longer has outbursts of anger. She is a keen participant in daily activities. She helps with household chores. She is happy to sit up late at night. She goes to bed tired and is on no medication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that these people are being cared for in less expensive facilities. It is far cheaper to look after them in dementia specific facilities. However, time and again the government has failed to address the issue of dementia. Dementia cannot be funded as a specific unit. Two dementia specific hostels exist in Victoria. The government's idea of dementia is to get a nursing home, mainstream people, stick a piano in the corner and call that a dementia ward. It is nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People with dementia are physically well but hard to care for. They need specialised facilities. Those facilities need not cost more; they can save money. Because of some bizarre, bent, presumably ideological move to the mainstream, rather than recognising the specific needs of people with dementia, people like Toni and Gertie&mdash;my constituents&mdash;are likely to be back in nursing homes or psychiatric facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other areas of aged care, and my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) will touch on some of those as the second speaker for the opposition. This is the International Year of the Family. Families provide the majority of care for elderly Australians yet what assistance or encouragement do the carers themselves get? Very little. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to rural families that do not have access to aged care facilities? Is the government prepared to be innovative and look at shared, multipurpose facilities to replace country hospitals that state governments are closing down? No. It is being dragged to the table kicking and screaming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a plethora of programs in the area of respite care which desperately need rationalisation. What is happening to the home and community care program? There are three levels of government involved in that program. There is massive duplication, it reaches only half its target population and everyone involved in the program says something has to be done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens to people from non-English speaking backgrounds when they need age care? We had a wave of migration from South-East Asia from 1975 to 1985. Where is the planning for when those people reach retirement age, dement and lose the ability to speak English? The planning is not there. What about people from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds who require nursing home assistance earlier because of their health status? There is no planning whatsoever in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have detailed shows a failure of duty, a failure of responsibility and a lack of care. I will finish my speech by going back to the Gregory report and the findings of the Australian Valuation Office. The findings show nursing homes with small or insufficient bathroom and toilet facilities; inadequate ramps and a lack of wheelchair access; inadequate heating, cooling or ventilation arrangements; and chutes being used for both food and soiled linen. This is 1994. This is not something from the 1960s; this is happening today. The fact that aged care facilities have inadequate heating and insufficient bathroom facilities warrants explanation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is good to finally have a discussion in this House on social justice issues. The government welcomes the idea that there should be more debate in this parliament on social policy. This debate has been a long time coming.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member has not only lost the position of Deputy Leader of the Opposition but also been put out of the shadow cabinet altogether. Taking his place in the new shadow ministry are a range of dry people, including the new shadow finance minister, the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser), who does not give a damn about social justice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can there be more cuts in the budget and more money given to social policy? That is a contradiction.

They cannot have both propositions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has a record of massive spending in the area of aged care. Before the election of the current Labor government, aged care in this country was a disgrace. If it were not for the federal Labor government taking control of aged care and providing massive increases in spending in aged care, the aged of our community would have nowhere to go and no programs to support them. The overwhelming proportion of the funding for aged care in this country does not come from state governments; it comes from the federal government. The federal government which has put this into place is the federal Labor government, which has a record of very significant spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year alone, $1.7 billion will be spent on nursing home care, which is just one aspect of aged care. But the honourable member for Chisholm says that that is not enough or that not enough is done with the money. That is an absurdity. Of course, there are problems, and I will come back to those in a moment. But, as I said, if the opposition is serious about doing something about the problems, it should support financial spending in those areas instead of crying crocodile tears about its concern for the aged. If those opposite had won the election, they would have cut out of the federal budget more than $10 billion in spending on social programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heart of the honourable member for Chisholm is in the right place but, unfortunately, he is of a tiny minority within the Liberal and National parties that is concerned with social policies. As was clearly reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> the day after the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) became the Leader of the Opposition, instead of moving to a more moderate position, the opposition put many people in the shadow cabinet who were from the dry side of economics and who were on the record as calling for cuts in spending on social programs, including those in the area of aged care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chisholm asked how the funding has progressed over the years. Let me say this: funding in nursing home care has continued to grow each year. This means that the government is addressing actively the increasing dependency of the nursing home population. Since we came to office, funds for frail, older Australians have increased dramatically and are well above increases in the cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, the government has increased even further funding to aged care. This budget has a strong focus on special needs groups. Not only is this government increasing funding, but it is also contributing to the better quality of life for older Australians in a range of important areas, and the opposition knows that. We have a major initiative which targets frail, older people who have insecure housing. This means that flexible services will be available to rural and remote communities that could not otherwise support a stand-alone nursing home or hostel. The government also announced a major initiative for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. This is a most important breakthrough which is based on the views of the communities themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also made a commitment to the needs of people with dementia. The honourable member for Chisholm mentioned dementia in his contribution. The government has spent more money on dementia and, contrary to what the honourable member for Chisholm said, it has special programs in the area of dementia care. This is the first government, state or federal, to introduce programs directed towards dementia care. So for the honourable member to get up and say that our idea of dementia is to put people to one side and give them a piano is a misrepresentation. We are funding a whole range of programs in the area of dementia, including research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gregory report is important. The first report was important, as was the second one. When the report was released, what did the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) say? Did she reject the report? The minister said that the report obviously found certain shortcomings and that the government would examine the best possible way to address those shortcomings raised by Professor Gregory. She did not say that we were going to run away from the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again say to honourable members that if we are going to spend additional moneys on nursing homes, as Professor Gregory says, we have to bite the bullet. There are several ways of doing that. One is to increase spending on nursing homes in the federal budget. Will the opposition support that or will it get up and say, `You are spending too much money in social policy areas,' as it has been saying over a number of years? Will the opposition support us if we put into place such a scheme? Does the opposition support increasing charges&mdash;another option mentioned by Professor Gregory&mdash;for people in nursing homes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation with aged care is very clear. There has been a massive increase in the Commonwealth's responsibility in this area. We face spending even more in the future because we have an ageing population. If we on both sides of the House are to be responsible in the area of aged care, we have to adopt a bipartisan approach to making a long-term commitment towards it. It is a question of getting agreement with the opposition parties that aged care is an area of social justice where we can make a commitment to spending. There is no doubt that there will be a need for even more increases in spending on aged care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Chisholm mentioned that there are some specific areas of need in aged care, such as people from non-English speaking backgrounds. Since being given responsibility for the access and equity agenda in relation to this matter earlier this year, I have been discussing with the minister and the Department of Human Services and Health what we can do about aged care for people of non-English speaking backgrounds. In the next six to eight weeks, I will be announcing a series of new initiatives in this area&mdash;a series of initiatives which have been carefully thought out and which will be targeted at achieving outcomes for people of non-English speaking backgrounds. There is no doubt that the honourable member for Chisholm is right: we have to address this question. But he did not come up with any constructive suggestions. All he came up with was, `Here is a problem for you.' This problem has been around for some time. It is only today that we heard from the honourable member&mdash;from anybody from the opposition parties, for that matter&mdash;about the need for something to be done in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that we will be addressing this question in a series of projects, not only through ethnic specific nursing homes and hostels but also by a substantial extension of the concept of clusters in nursing homes and hostels, which are directed towards ensuring the formation of particular cultural and linguistic groupings in homes and hostels and ensuring that they are serviced by people who speak the appropriate language and who are familiar with the particular cultural background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the Gregory report. The government has been waiting for this report for some time; it has not procrastinated.

The report by Sir William Keys was supposed to be finished but we had a problem with the industry, which wanted more time for consultation. How are we to get action in the area of capital development and new investment in nursing homes? The honourable member talks about nursing home proprietors and hostel proprietors wanting to get out of the industry. That is the case only in some sections of the industry; he has exaggerated the problem. We have to consult with industry groups and with the organisations representing those groups to make sure that we put in place systems, practices and approaches which they consider suitable, and on the basis of which they will be investing in nursing homes and hostels in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to support the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) today in raising his concerns, first of all about the fact that this report was released not in the parliament but elsewhere. I say again, as I have had to say before, that I feel somewhat sorry for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous) because again he is left to hold the fort and the minister, the honourable member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence), is not here. I do not criticise him at all. He does very well to defend her, but she should be here not only to defend the government's position but also to listen to what others in this place have to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report by Professor Bob Gregory, which has been sat on despite the parliamentary secretary's denials, reveals the crisis facing Australia's nursing homes and the industry. It prompts us to think of the whole area of aged care. In nursing homes, though, which look predominantly after the frail aged, Professor Gregory relates this crisis directly to the 1988 introduction by the government of a new funding formula and then the 1991 budget decision to halve the level of funding provided for upgrading nursing homes. He estimates that upgrading the existing stock may cost as much as $520 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Gregory raises other points. There is a need for a substantial improvement in nursing home buildings, but because of the government funding formula there is a lack of incentive to maintain a good quality of nursing home stock. Eighteen per cent of residents live in rooms with five or more beds, and toilets are not large enough to allow carers or walking frames in with the residents. The present funding system does not provide sufficient funds, and does not attract the applications necessary for placements and upgrading of nursing homes in the voluntary sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on and on, but it is probably just necessary to look at the fact that Australia does have an ageing population. The member for Chisholm has given us some vital statistics on this fact. We are all growing old, therefore this matter is relevant to all of us. Whichever side of the House we sit on, no-one can say we should be disinterested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EPAC report states that the percentage of people over 80 by the year 2051 is going to be extraordinarily high. Many Australians, of course, do remain fit. I am happy to say longevity runs in my family. My father, who is 81, has been on the tractor recently trying to beat the rain and my mother, who is in her 70s, helps him. That is a good sign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to my own old age, and hope to remain active. A great number of people do the same. There are aged Australians caring for other aged Australians. There are women nursing their husbands who are dying in their late eighties, and then where do they go? There are women and men who came here as migrants in the 1940s and 1950s, and while the men went out to work and learned English the women stayed at home and still do not know how to speak English. These people are now being cared for in aged hostels and nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we think of aged care, we have to think of those who are not as independent as they once were receiving home care from the HACC program. Then there is the community care package, the hostels and the nursing homes. There are criteria for assessment under which people will be judged as to what they will have. That is fair enough, but it gets a little complex. For instance, the government has been a little tardy about talking to people working in the industry. It may not have been necessary to have so many reports if there had been more consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The director of one nursing home to whom I recently spoke claims that the authorities are not prepared or unable to acknowledge the level of care required for dementia sufferers. Their needs are quite different from the needs of those with obvious physical frailties or disabilities. There is general agreement that there must be some measure of assessment. The emphasis, though, is on physical rather than mental health. There are 14 questions which must be answered, and they go something like this: Is the patient incontinent? What about the skin integrity? What special nursing is required? Is there physical aggression, verbal disruption, behaviour problems, vision, hearing, speech comprehension? What is their mobility? What are their toilet requirements? What are their washing and dressing requirements, eating requirements and their level of independence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This classification for nursing homes residents equals nursing hours which, in turn, equals dollars. This assessment is a funding tool and does not equate to care given. It gives little recognition for dementia. There is no classification, either, for palliative care, but palliative care is being given in nursing homes. This equals many hours of specialised care. One nursing home has a patient on a ventilator. He is not incontinent, he is not physically aggressive, he is not verbally disruptive. Therefore he scores few points and therefore few nursing hours and few dollars but in fact requires one-to-one care from between three to six hours per day. Prior to his admission to the nursing home he received 24-hour care which was HACC funded and therefore cost the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Problems for carers are becoming more complex. Once people did not live so long and when they were particularly ill they were cared for in more acute settings. These are the problems to be looked at. The government from time to time jokes about the fact that we have been on the opposition benches for too long. I wish that we had not. Having been in government for that degree of time, the government has had responsibility. There has been neglect. The nursing home industry has been waiting since 1991, when a departmental review recommended that there should be an immediate $1.56 per resident per day increase as a component of federal government funding for changes to make the industry viable. The industry says, `We look forward to the consultative process, but we have been waiting for ages and it does not seem to happen.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept the fact that finding government funding for a  whole lot of different programs is difficult. I am not saying money grows on trees, but there should be more flexible arrangements. Those people who fear&mdash;like I fear&mdash;that in their old age they will not have adequate care and who are prepared to put money away should be given the opportunity to perhaps pay for a standard of care or contribute on top of that government funding. When we have that mix of financial arrangements there will be more money to go around. There will be more money for capital expenditure on those homes, which will benefit those who come from a poorer sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A safety net will exist so that the environment in which they are being cared for will not have the same chute used for rubbish and linen. Dementia sufferers will not be rescued off the streets in their dressing gowns, or perhaps having discarded some portion of their clothing, causing embarrassment to their carers and their families. There should be proper facilities for them. This situation will only get worse as we live longer because, the longer we live, the more dementia sufferers there will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have concentrated largely on the nursing home problems because the report prompts me to do so today. But the home and community care program has come under the microscope recently with the public inquiry held by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. It has been most interesting. There has been a bipartisan approach to many of the areas we have been following up. But unofficial rationing has been taking place in the HACC program because there have not been enough funds to go around; evidence has been given to that effect. Evidence has been given that the young disabled are fighting for the same HACC dollar that the frail aged are fighting for. Evidence has been given that people who have been assessed as needing hostel accommodation are being cared for in their homes. Certainly in my own electorate I have found people in hostels on the 4 or 5 level who really should be moving into nursing homes as they rapidly change up to the 2 or 3 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office was recently instrumental in finding a nursing home bed for one of my constituents who had nowhere to go and who was suffering badly from dementia. While investigating that I found that there were 75 people in public hospital beds awaiting admission to nursing home beds and that there was nowhere else for them to go. So I would like to draw to the attention of this parliament the fact that we need to be thinking about our aged and planning for them very carefully. It is no good trying to do everything once the real crisis of the situation is upon us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak to this issue. As the convener of the caucus aged care task force, I have taken a keen interest in this topic. It is interesting that both the opposition speakers have criticised the government's commissioning of reports. They say, `We do not want reports; we want action.' They say, `Not enough consultation has occurred.' Those reports precisely involve consultation. Professor Gregory was at great pains to consult all the players in those issues. While saying, `We do not want reports' they have also accused of us of dragging the chain and not responding to those reports. The most recent Gregory report has only just been released. There has been no dragging of the chain on that. One of the first things this new minister did when she came to office was to agree to the recommendations of the Keys report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both speakers from the opposition have outlined a situation in our aged care system, particularly in nursing homes, with which I do not think anybody on this side would disagree. That is precisely why this government has commissioned the reports that we have alluded to and why it is now acting on them; it has taken action. When this government came to office it found aged care in a very poor state: aged Australians were over-dependent in nursing home care, they lacked alternatives and they had no choices. People without choice often found themselves in nursing homes because there was simply no alternative support for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1981 the Auditor-General concluded that there was inadequate financial accountability for nursing home funding and no guarantee of quality for residents. A few years later, Senator Giles chaired a Senate select inquiry into private nursing homes and concluded that quality was very mixed, despite the good efforts of some providers, and that there was insufficient government regulation. That report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . poor treatment of the patient, unsanitary conditions, poor food, inadequate control of drugs, improper use of restraints (both physical and medicinal), assaults on human dignity and reprisals against those who complain.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the situation when this government came to office in the early 1980s. The government has taken considerable action in that time to rectify that situation but, as all speakers have noted, it is not an easy one; it does not happen overnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government has taken great action as far as spending money is concerned. Expenditure on aged care in 1992-93 was 170 per cent more than in 1983-84. Adjusting for inflation, the 1992-93 expenditure was 61 per cent higher than for 1983-84 compared to an estimated increase of 32 per cent in the target population over the same period. So to accuse us of inaction and procrastination is utter rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expenditure on community care services, which obviously involve the aged, has risen even more dramatically. Expenditure on community care services in 1938-84 was $61.5 million, while in 1992-93 it had risen to $342 million. This represents an increase of over 450 per cent over this period, or a real increase in funding of over 230 per cent. So please do not tell us that we are not spending enough money on this problem. </PARA>

Since 1986, the government has been implementing a strategy of aged care reform. This has taken a number of different angles. This is comprised principally of changing the balance of care away from nursing homes towards support for people living in their own homes and in hostels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home and community care program has been alluded to. As the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) has mentioned, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has been undertaking an inquiry. Certainly there has been duplication. Certainly there needs to be streamlining. I am glad that she admits there has been bipartisan agreement on it. The government has also introduced what are known as community aged care packages, which provide the equivalent of hostel accommodation in a person's own home. The opposition will agree that those choices are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Assessment for people going into nursing homes and hostels has also been streamlined. Gone are the days when we put granny in a nursing home because she was in the way. Aged care assessment teams assess a person's eligibility for a hostel or nursing home, and that is extremely important. Standards of care have also improved. We no longer have what we call regulations&mdash;the big policeman looking at us and saying that we can or cannot do something. Standards monitoring, which looks at outcome standards, is much more important. I will quote again from the Giles report in the pre-1980s:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . regulations . . . generally assess whether a facility is capable of delivering required services, not whether these services have been implemented or whether quality care has actually been received.</PARA>
<PARA>Quality care is what is important. That is what this government is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Support for carers has also been an important plank of this government's policy. The honourable member for Adelaide alluded to the fact that we often find aged people looking after aged people. Sons and daughters of ageing people are often left at home to care for them. Support for carers is an important part of our policy, and it is an important part of the HACC program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One issue that has taken a great deal of time in this debate is dementia. It is not an easy issue. There are no easy answers when people find themselves in a demented state, be it mild, severe or somewhere in between. It is not easy for the people around them, be it their family, carers or the people who look after them in institutions. I have had the privilege of visiting some dementia specific facilities. I am sorry that the honourable member for Adelaide has left the chamber, because one of the most impressive ones was in her electorate, where a facility was built specifically to care for people with dementia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national action plan for dementia care is again an important plank of this government's policy. Unfortunately, when Brian Burdekin put together his report, many of the actions and plans by the government were not in front of him. So many of his criticisms have become invalid because of that time lapse. The most startling thing is the people on the other side criticising this government for not taking sufficient action on dementia. Fightback said that the opposition would spend $10 million on dementia care. The national action plan spends $30 million, and we have now included an extra $12 million in this year's budget. So please do not call that inaction or procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, dementia care is extremely important. The $30 million in the national action plan includes demonstration programs, which I alluded to in an earlier speech in this place; funding to aged care assessment teams to better assess people with dementia and improve knowledge and expertise in the area of dementia; and more services for people suffering from dementia. An extra $12.3 million in this budget has been allocated for aged care assessment teams to set up psycho-geriatric units, which are extremely important. I have a psycho-geriatric nursing home in my electorate which I know is in need of improvement. What do we do with people who are a danger to themselves and sometimes to others? It is very difficult.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The committee's 57th general report deals with the committee's activities during 1993 and covers the work of the 30th and 31st committees. During the year the committee met on 33 occasions and presented nine reports. The estimated cost of public works on which the committee reported was just over $252 million. Projects ranged from the construction of a new transmission tower on the top of Mount Wellington to improve and enhance the scope of television and radio reception to southern Tasmania, to the refurbishment of historic Victoria Barracks in Melbourne to provide modern office accommodation, to the redevelopment of CSIRO facilities at Prospect near Sydney. The projects were varied in extent and function. All were recommended for approval by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As in previous years, the committee takes the opportunity to highlight a number of important matters in its general reports. A feature of the past year was the number of briefings from senior officials of departments, agencies and industry. Officers from the Department of Defence, the Defence Housing Authority, the Civil Aviation Authority, the Australian National Audit Office, Overseas Property Group, Commonwealth Fire Board, and Kelstrom Pty Ltd briefed the committee on a wide variety of matters relevant to inquiries and public works in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight of the year was the second public works committee conference, which was held here at Parliament House. Members of public works committees or their equivalents from the parliaments of Tasmania, Queensland, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory and the New South Wales public accounts committee, because of its interest in the private funding of public infrastructure, and representatives of the Commonwealth attended the conference. The conference addressed a variety of statutory and operational matters which are common to, or have significant ramifications for, inquiries involving the proposed expenditure of considerable public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matters discussed at the conference included: the use of consultants; the use of value management techniques to assess public works; follow-up procedures on works in progress; the private funding of infrastructure; and the impact of the untying of Commonwealth departments and agencies from a central government design and construction authority. It is planned to hold these conferences every year if the calendars of the various parliaments permit. The next conference will be held in Hobart later this year and we hope to see each state and territory represented, perhaps even Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of significant issues emerged during the year and these are described in the report. These relate to the provision of earth leakage circuit breakers and smoke detectors in Defence Housing Authority dwellings, the provision in all Commonwealth buildings of facilities for people with disabilities to ensure that right of equal access is maintained, and energy conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Public Works Committee Act precludes the committee from meeting overseas, although the committee is required to inquire into and report on overseas works such as embassies and high commissions. When members of the public works committee are on delegations or are overseas in a private capacity, they always inspect any work that is being considered by the committee. This anomaly has caused problems. The committee is unable to inspect existing buildings and sites proposed for work and to hold informal discussions with local staff and officials responsible for the design and construction of what are, after all, buildings which in some way should reflect Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore believes that the Public Works Committee Act should be amended to enable the committee or a sectional committee to undertake inspections overseas and for the resources to be available for it to do so. We have put this up before, but it has always fallen on deaf ears. As the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) is at the table, it may get a better reception this time. I have said before that it is much more prudent and effective if local inspections and discussions are held before committee inquiries, as is the case with other projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been brought home to us with a recent project, the Hanoi Embassy complex. Although we have the handicap that by the time it reaches us a project is essentially a fait accompli, at the design stage, I doubt very much that had we inspected this site we would have recommended the Hanoi project. We would also save the government considerable amounts of money with overseas inspections, as it would be much cheaper than flying bureaucrats and models to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion I would like to make special mention of a number of former committee members who retired from the committee, and the parliament for that matter, during the report period. Mr Lloyd O'Neil, the former member for Grey, and Mr Ewen Cameron, the former member for Indi, served on the committee from May 1990 to February 1993. I would like to thank them both for the contributions they have made to the committee and to the parliament. I should also mention the former Vice-Chairman, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), and another former committee member, the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott), for their contributions. I thank the committee members for the support they have given me during the year, especially the Vice-Chairman, Senator Paul Calvert. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, because of the nature of the work and the pressures we are increasingly under, makes tremendous demands on the membership and I thank the committee members for their hard work during the past year. The committee also thanks the staff for the friendly and efficient way in which they respond to the many demands members place on them. It is not always easy dealing with the committee members, but the staff carry out that work in a most efficient and friendly manner. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>Customs Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1994 and Excise Tariff Proposal No. 3 of 1994, which I have just tabled, contain alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1987 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which arise from measures announced in the 1994-95 budget and additional measures connected with the Civil Aviation Authority's charges for 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These alterations operate on and from 1 July 1994. The Treasurer announced on budget night 10 May an increase in customs and excise duties on aviation gasoline and kerosene for use in aircraft of 1.194c per litre. These increases are a further part of the process announced by the government in the 1992-93 budget of the phased introduction of full recovery of the costs incurred in implementing aviation safety standards and 50 per cent of the costs of safety standards setting and compliance. The rates of duty applicable to avgas are subject to further variation in respect to the duty collected and paid to the CAA to recover airways costs attributable to avgas powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed reduction of 7.521c per litre follows the adoption by the CAA of a marginal cost basis for the pricing of services provided to operators of avgas powered aircraft. This approach has been adopted in recognition of the fact that a large proportion of CAA facilities are put in place because they are required for regular public transport operations mostly undertaken by aviation kerosene powered aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alteration contained in Excise Tariff Proposal No. 4 of 1994 operates on and from 1 April 1994. This is the date on which the amendments contained in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Act 1993 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 1993 relating to the government's decision to combat fuel substitution came into operation. The alteration provides exemption from excise duty for crude oil and condensate for all uses other than as fuels, and where they are used as fuels, in the recovery, production, transportation or refining of crude oil or condensate. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)That:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)subsequent to the presentation and first reading of the Financial Management and Accountability Bill 1994, the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Bill 1994 and the Auditor-General Bill 1994 and associated memoranda, the Bills be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for consideration and an advisory report to the House by 23 August 1994; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the terms of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this reference to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA>In moving that the package of bills be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for examination and report by the fourth week of the spring sittings, I need to point out that in accordance with standing orders the second readings of this package of bills will take place in the next week of sittings; that is, in the first week of the spring sittings. These bills, like few others, will ultimately have an impact on the entire field of government activity, simply because almost every action of the government has a financial implication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JCPA was the body which initiated action to replace the Audit Act and the government believes that it should be the body to formally examine, in the first instance and on behalf of the parliament, the proposed outcome of this action. The government believes that with these bills having a large technical content input from the JCPA, it will assist the debate, which, as I have previously announced, is intended to take place in the spring sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government sees the referral of bills to the JCPA as akin to issuing them as an exposure draft. Members wishing to contribute to the consideration of the package should feel encouraged to do so, either through the proceedings of the JCPA or direct to the government. Either way, their views will be taken into account. Further consideration of this package will also occur in the government's own committee process. Our committees will be giving more detailed consideration to this package and any amendments forthcoming from the other channels that I referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a most important set of changes to the Audit Act, which I do not think has been much altered since it was first put in place in 1901. I think it behoves us to give this process a leg along, which means that we have to proceed with a reasonable degree of expedition. Otherwise it will get bogged down and then nothing will be achieved. I should point out that the committee that gave this consideration did so some years ago. It has taken a long time to get to this point because there has had to be an infinite variety of consultation through departments, through government business enterprises and, of course, with the Auditor-General's office and other aspects more informal of the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet has had a look at the matter and I think we are now in a situation where some structure has to be put into those considerations. These bills do put that structure into the further consideration. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts has done a fine job in this area thus far, so I think it is totally appropriate that we and the Senate should have its advice on how it thinks we have measured up to the sorts of things it thinks are important in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that members of my own party will want a bit of a further look at these things&mdash;I am sure members of the opposition parties also will want a bit of a look at these things&mdash;but the way in which we have ordered business in this place, which I think is very much for the better, means that if we are actually going to have this package through by Christmas there needs to be a formal introduction effectively right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A whole series of purposes is served by this process. The way in which we are doing it effectively creates something of the nature of an exposure draft without actually formally entitling it as such. From the arrangements we have informally with colleagues on all sides of the Senate, the passage of this by Christmas will be comfortable, provided that at the end of the day they like the product. The way in which attention has been paid these matters by all the people that I have referred to, I think, amply justifies decent handling of it by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, virtually by implication in the things that I have been saying, the government is not so proud of its authorship in this regard that it is going to take umbrage at getting additional advice from any sources and we look forward to the consultative processes yet in hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first thing that one must say about the white paper is that it is not about creating jobs; it is about training. As Professor Helen Hughes has said, it is not about getting rid of unemployment but about making unemployment palatable. The white paper is about training and other schemes designed to reduce the statistical levels of unemployment to conceal unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The schemes, training and otherwise, within the white paper have the potential to hide over 200,000 unemployed people from the unemployment figures. On a conservative estimate, when fully operational the jobs compact within the white paper could hide some 120,000 unemployed people, the parenting allowance could hide some 59,000, and the mature age allowance could hide some 30,000. The white paper is designed to make it appear to the community that these policies are providing jobs to fix the unemployment problem created by the choice of high unemployment policies by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to bring the 1980s boom to a halt, when in fact those people who have been the victims of those policies are to be put through yet more training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Training without job prospects is demoralising. The success of the white paper, in the end, will depend on whether or not the government policies that are currently in place will actually bring about economic growth. The figures that the government has put into the budget&mdash;figures derived from the Treasury estimates of growth over the remainder of this decade&mdash;lead to the inevitable and sad conclusion that by the end of this decade unemployment is likely to still be of the order of seven per cent, even if there is no further downturn in the economy. That means that many of those who are currently finding it impossible to get employment face the prospect of continuing and prolonged unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me today I want to comment particularly on the training proposals in the white paper. At the centre of the white paper's job compact is the training wage. It must be made quite clear that the concept of a training wage is one which the coalition has advocated for quite some time. Indeed, it advocated it before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of the training wage recognises that unemployed people excluded from the work force can obtain jobs if there is sufficient incentive for employers to take them on. These are training jobs. Whether they will obtain sustainable jobs will depend entirely on the growth in the economy and on whether enterprises find it appropriate to take on people to meet the growing demand. But let us focus for a moment on the prospect of giving unemployed people at least a temporary job, in many cases to gain the first work experience that they will have had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last election the coalition put forward a proposal which we called the Austrain scheme, combined with a taxpayer funded user-buys scheme for young and older unemployed persons. The great strength of the scheme which the coalition put forward was that it combined a major financial incentive to employers, which increased the longer a person had been unemployed, with a commitment by the Commonwealth to fund training in a very flexible way that met the needs of employers and unemployed people. It was a system which provided genuine choice as to the kind of training which would be undertaken by the employee, thus ensuring that it was the best possible training for the future opportunities for the formerly unemployed person and that it was training which met the demand from enterprises and from trainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At long last the government has recognised that a training wage has a role to play. It has taken a long time to get the ACTU even to that recognition. Unfortunately, the government has already run into significant problems with the scheme that it has tried to put in place&mdash;a scheme which has some significantly different features from those which the coalition advocated. The problems that the government has faced with this scheme are self-inflicted problems. They have occurred because the government has allowed the training agenda to be dominated by the needs and demands of the trade union movement for a training system which can be used to expand the scope and influence of the power holders in the government's centralised industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems have occurred for the same reasons that the government has run into difficulties with its superannuation policies&mdash;noted this morning by the press who commented adversely on yesterday's statement of the Treasurer (Mr Willis)&mdash;its education policies, its tax policies and its industrial relations policies. It is a relentlessly sectional government. Every major policy decision must be forced through the ACTU approval process and be subject to an ACTU veto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has defined the training wage in a way which meets the requirements of the ACTU. It is to be based on a single national award. The training element is to incorporate the Carmichael training agenda, with its unsatisfactory implementation of competency based training and its bureaucratic and costly accreditation arrangements. The training wages proposed and approved by the ACTU are higher in some cases than the minimum rates currently payable under existing awards. The problem with this approach is that it means the government has had to present the employers&mdash;that is, the people who are going to have to offer the jobs&mdash;with a fait accompli. There has been no satisfactory discussion with those who are going to have to employ people under the training wage. They have been told by the ACTU and by the minister on behalf of the ACTU, `Take it or leave it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The employers who have been placed in this very difficult position have acted with goodwill. They want a workable training wage system. They have expressed a range of concerns: the level of wage rates for young unemployed people, the role of trade unions in the accreditation of training schemes, and the extent of costly and bureaucratic accreditation processes which may apply. Despite these concerns the employer representatives have gone along, hoping that their members will find the arrangements workable but knowing all the time that, if they do not, the training wage scheme as proposed by the government in the white paper simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The employers have to take on trust the fact that the state tribunals, which generally provide coverage of employees in clerical and retail occupations&mdash;two of the key areas which have to be expected to play a role in the implementation of the scheme&mdash;will provide a flow-on of the conditions embodied in the single national award. As usual, the states too have simply been left out of the consultation process in setting up the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such was the level of concern expressed by the employer organisations over the ACTU approved training scheme that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) was forced to cut five days off his overseas trip last week and fly home to attempt to stitch up a deal with the employer representatives and ease their concerns. In the end, whether a deal is struck or not in itself means little. The only thing that matters is whether the terms in which the training wage are finally implemented are terms on which small businesses throughout Australia will be prepared to employ unemployed people. If the scheme is not attractive to Australian small business, it will fail. No amount of behind the scenes dealing, threatening and bludgeoning employers, is going to achieve that objective. In the end, those employment decisions are going to be made by individual small businesses themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By around November or December this year, we will get an indication of whether the deal which has been stitched up is going to lead to an effective training wage system, but it will be quite some time before we know this. I make the point very clearly that this scheme&mdash;the job compact&mdash;offers no hope in the near future to the great majority of the long-term unemployed, who are the victims of the deliberate high unemployment policy of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Even though the proposals are to be implemented formally in July this year, it will be literally years before many unemployed people will be offered jobs under the job compact. The compact is to be phased in over four years, and I do not think that people who have been unemployed for over 12 months are going to take much comfort from the fine print in the white paper which spells out clearly that people who have been receiving benefits for over 18 months `will have received a job compact offer by the end of 1997-98'. Under these proposals, that is how long some people are going to have to wait to get some benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the white paper was presented, a report of great significance on the training arrangements the government has established has been published. This report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Successful reform: competitive skills for Australians and Australian enterprises</EMPHASIS>, and was prepared by the Allen Consulting Group. I will refer to it in my remarks as the Fitzgerald report, after the executive director who handled the report, Dr Vince Fitzgerald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has been presented since the white paper with the white paper proposals in mind. It is quite plain that, in the view of the consultants, the white paper has not remedied the very serious problems in the government's existing training arrangements, which under the training wage are intended to provide the foundations for training. While framed in the forward-looking language that one expects of a consultant's report, the report is a damning indictment of the training arrangements the government already has in place, and it recommends a major change of direction in the nature of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the single most damning statement in the Fitzgerald report is the conclusion, which states that the government's training reforms `do not appear to have had a demonstrable effect on enterprises' decisions or productivity'. That is, they have failed for some six years now&mdash;since these training reforms were put in place&mdash;to contribute to lifting productivity or affecting the decisions of Australian enterprises about training. They have failed by one of the central criteria by which they have to be assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change of direction that the report recommends is towards arrangements oriented to the needs of enterprises rather than industries, which are responsive to the directly expressed needs of employers and those seeking training. In short, the report recommends the creation of a national training market based on user-buys principles&mdash;the very principles which the coalition advocated before the last election and which the government and its accord partners have been so reluctant to put into effect in the training area. The Fitzgerald report is quite clear. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the current approach to reform will not, without change, bring about the fundamental outcomes desired on a satisfactory scale.</PARA>
<PARA>The report recommends that immediate action should be initiated and completed by the end of this year to put in place the machinery needed to measure the actual outcomes in skill formation and enterprises and the links to enterprise productivity, together with employment outcome measures for individuals and a range of other tasks which the government must set about implementing if, according to the report, there is going to be any successful outcome to the training initiatives in the white paper and the broader national training agenda. Unfortunately, we have a government whose training agenda, like so many of its other agendas, has been motivated entirely by the politics of policy making within this government. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a lot more fortunate than the honourable member for Ballarat, given the fact that I chose to be a member of the Australian Labor Party, that is for sure. Unemployment was the major issue at the last federal election and it remains a major political and social issue in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During 1992, when in a recession, unemployment was unacceptably high&mdash;over 11 per cent. I recall the glee and the smiles at the time on the faces of the opposition leader and the frontbench opposition members. They loved the high levels of unemployment that existed in 1992, for two reasons. Those opposite see unemployment as desirable. As friends of the bosses, they want to drive the price of labour down. Consistent with the theory of supply and demand, the bigger the pool of unemployed, the bigger the supply of labour. In that way they can keep the price of labour down. That is the cynical way the opposition views unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other reason opposition members relished high unemployment was that they saw it as an electoral winner. Given that we were in government and that we had unacceptably high levels of unemployment during a recession, the opposition thought that was the way to win the federal election in 1993. So for those two reasons our opponents&mdash;the Liberal-National Party coalition&mdash;relished the fact that there was high unemployment. They did not care about the unemployed, the ordinary people, and the social and human tragedy that ensues from unemployment; they were just looking forward to their electoral prospects. I guess they thought that the higher unemployment was, the lower they could force wages down. That was quite obvious from the policies they took to the election in 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot today from previous speakers on the other side, particularly from the last speaker, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), about how similar the government's initiatives in the white paper are to their Austrain proposal. Nothing could be further from the truth as far as I am concerned. We dubbed the opposition's Austrain proposal `Aus-slave' because it was really about forcing people's wages down to slave wages. There was no training in the Austrain proposal. That is the big difference between our proposal and their proposal. Our training wage is about providing training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our whole emphasis in this area, since the Carmichael report, has been on skilling and training the work force, whether unemployed or not. We have had some great successes in that area. I will talk about them later. The opposition's policy was to reduce people's wages&mdash;I believe it was by $3 or $3.50 an hour&mdash;depending on age. Those opposite wanted to bring in Austrain and a youth wage of around $3 a hour. They wanted to sell off the CES and cut people off the dole after eight months&mdash;the unemployed that they are so concerned about! The Jobsback policy, which the opposition took to the election, is the younger sibling of Fightback. That is one of the reasons it was resoundingly defeated in the 1993 election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following our election victory, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and this government set about addressing unemployment head on. We recognised that unemployment was the major political issue that faced us in 1993 and faces us for the next three ensuing years. The Prime Minister and the then employment minister made a number of statements to address unemployment. A task force was set up within the caucus. I was privileged to be a member of that caucus employment task force. We set about addressing the problem of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment. There was about a million unemployed people when we came out of the recession. The statistics showed that, of those million or so, at least 300,000&mdash;it is probably more like 400,000&mdash;were long-term unemployed; that is, they were unemployed for over 12 months. That was a serious problem that we saw with the cycle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, when unemployment was high as a result of the recession, long-term unemployment went up. When employment grew throughout the 1980s in the period of the Hawke government, unemployment came down, but long-term unemployment did not come down by that much. It then went up further during the recession in the 1990s. Statistics and graphs presented by experts, such as Dr Bruce Chapman, showed that long-term unemployment was becoming entrenched and a real problem. The caucus task force looked at that issue and consulted widely with people in the community. We received hundreds of submissions. Everyone had an idea about what to do on unemployment. Many worthwhile submissions were received by that task force. As I said, we received very significant advice from experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the task force also talked a lot amongst themselves about the real causes of unemployment. I think we need to go back and look at unemployment over the last couple of decades. Quite apart from the fact that we were in a recession, there were some structural reasons for the unemployment figures. There are more women seeking employment&mdash;which is a positive thing&mdash;since the great equal pay cases were fought and won in the early 1970s as a result of the efforts of the trade union movement, the same union movement that is vilified and harassed by the opposition. So trade unions were the ones responsible for equal pay for women. Following the revolution in women's issues, more women quite rightly sought to participate in the workplace. Even though it was a very positive social development, in terms of overall participation, it increased the size of the labour market. So, naturally, there were pressures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was offset to some extent by the fact that, since 1983, the number of students staying at school until year 12 has increased from about 30 per cent to about 80 per cent. That means considerably fewer young people attempt to enter the work force before the age of around 18. As I said, 80 per cent of students stay at school until year 12, whereas 10 years ago only 30 per cent stayed at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to elaborate on technological change except to say that, with computers, automation and info-technology, work that was formerly done manually is now done by computers. That means fewer jobs are required, particularly in the case of unskilled and routine types of jobs. So fewer jobs are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform has been very positive in the 1980s, but a by-product has been more unemployment because fewer people are required to do the same amount of work. We have debated tariffs, the lowering of tariffs and the removal of protection. The reality is that that has cost jobs in some industries. So in the short term that is a problem which has added to unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all those long-term structural problems which are a feature of the 1990s, we were in a recession from 1990 to 1992. Now we are in a very strong economic recovery. We have come out of a recession. We have very high levels of growth and are in a recovery. The opposition does not like that. Just as it enjoyed having high unemployment before the last election, it is now very concerned about growth. We hear a lot of platitudes from the opposition about how it is a low quality recovery and that we had better watch out because interest rates will rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had this nonsense last week about interest rates rising in the near future. What intrigues me is comments from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) about the boom-bust cycle. They said, `It is no good having all this growth and economic recovery because we are only in a boom-bust cycle. We will have recovery, then a boom and go bust again. It is dreadful. The sky will fall in.' I find that intriguing because I thought that booms and busts in economic cycles were an essential feature of a capitalist economy. I thought that the coalition was a party of private enterprise and market capitalism. What are we seeing here? Are we seeing the Leader of the Opposition becoming a new socialist in Australian politics?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only guarantee&mdash;if there is one, and I am not sure that there is&mdash;that we will never have a boom-bust cycle is by having a totally planned command economy, such as that in the Soviet Union. So what does the opposition want? Is it saying that we should not have boom-bust cycles, that we should not have economic cycles but have a planned economy? That just goes to show how much nonsense we get from this desperate opposition. It is absolutely desperate to know what to do, given that the government has won the so-called unwinnable election. The opposition missed its chance at government when unemployment was high and when economic circumstances suggested that there could be a change of government. There was no change of government. Those opposite missed their chance. They now find that there is an economic recovery, unemployment levels are reducing, jobs are increasing and that this government has presented a magnificent white paper. The opposition has to resort to negative tactics like having stupid little flags on its benches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The caucus task force took a number of submissions and produced a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Growth plus</EMPHASIS>. The task force identified that, while we need market driven economic growth to create jobs and sustain the recovery, we need more than that: we need a social side; a human side, if you like. That is where initiatives such as the job compact come in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as recommending that the government develop a job compact, the task force recommended that there be greater flexibility in hours of work, more opportunities for part-time work and a case management approach taken to unemployment. That initiative has now been adopted in the white paper. In addition, we recommended that the CES be revitalised. This initiative has also been incorporated in the white paper. The task force report was subsequently presented to the expert committee which in turn produced a green paper. After further community consultation this led to the Working Nation document which was presented to the House on 4 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper contains the very important job compact initiative which will apply to all those who have been in receipt of jobsearch or newstart allowances for over 18 months. The job compact will include more intensive case management, training and support to ensure that unemployed people are ready for jobs when they become available and a training wage, which has been criticised today. I think the comments on that matter speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training wage was embraced and agreed to by the ACTU, the representatives of the trade union movement, which, after all, is the legitimate representative of workers&mdash;the people of Australia. I make no apology for the fact that the government thinks it is very important to get the union movement to support initiatives in the labour market. I believe case management will be very important and widely available. The one-on-one case management model will apply to all recipients of the youth training allowance and the newstart allowance, the short-term unemployed who are considered to be at high risk of becoming long-term employed, people who are not on the job compact and all recipients of the job compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other feature of case management is competition. Case management will be provided by the CES and the CES will receive a boost in resources and get more and better trained staff to implement the initiatives contained in the white paper. There will also be the opportunity for community organisations such as Skillshare and private sector organisations to provide this case management. ESRA, the Employment Services Regulation Agency, will oversee the whole process. It will have an important role in ensuring that these very important initiatives in the labour market are implemented successfully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to stress the importance of the regional development initiatives contained in the white paper. One of the keys to better employment is to provide jobs close to where people live in the growing regions of Australia. In terms of growth, there is no region more important than the Macarthur region in south-west Sydney which is the area I represent. I have been working closely with the honourable  member  for  Werriwa (Mr Latham), the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) in order to develop a regional organisation in the area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The member of the Australian Labor Party who has just resumed his seat, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland), is following the traditional path that speakers from that side of the House have followed for a number of years, the years which encompassed the beginnings of the recession. What those opposite cannot understand is that the recession was caused by the government's mismanagement of Australia. From time to time, there is public discussion about the ambitious 1980s and the way this government fostered the wheeler-dealers, the paper managers, across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent days, we have been regaled by tales of the Holmes a Court attack on BHP. I have said in this House before&mdash;and the member for Macarthur who is leaving the House will remember it&mdash;that it was his government that encouraged Holmes a Court's attack on BHP. Had the attack been successful, this government would have been responsible for the dismemberment of Australia's greatest national asset in relation to the economy and private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That attack and the mismanagement of government finances by the three Labor administrations in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria are the factors behind the recession in this country. They have set this country back years in its recovery. The honourable member referred to the recovery, but the opposition knows what caused the recession that is behind the recovery that is now occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the basis of the recovery? We all support the increase in sales and look forward to the promise the government has made in relation to capital investment and industry, which is yet to be fulfilled, but we know that so far the recovery has been based on debt. I pose this question to anyone who wants to discuss the issue: if we took the $13 1/2 billion deficit out of the budget, would we have a recovery? Of course we would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government may well say that the deficit is its instrument for bringing about the recovery. That might be so in the short term. However, the government is not just loading up the economy for our children; it is also loading up the economy in the immediate future. From here on, year after year we have to meet the increasing debt repayment. This will be a drag on the national budget for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper and the One Nation statement, which was presented to the House a year ago, are spurred on by the government's guilty conscience about the recession and the need to do something for the Australian people. The government might be successful here and there and, when it is successful, I support it, as any Australian would. We have to do what we can to get out of this enormous recession. Its after-effects will live on not just in an economic sense but in the psychology of Australians. I say to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, that the Australian people will not forgive the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have before the House the Working Nation white paper. Page 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a White Paper on employment and growth. We take the view that the two are inseparable; success in one will complement the other. The Paper might even be taken to mark the end of the old debate about economic and social goals. The policies in this White Paper derive from the premise that those goals are indivisible.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course they are indivisible. If we are going to have success in producing long-term jobs for those middle age people and youths now out of work, we will have to have growth. What does the white paper say about growth? We find many references in the white paper to training, the job compact and the creation of employment. But we need to look at the basis upon which employment is to grow in the future&mdash;and I do not mean the debt to which I have already referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper gets thin when it refers to the matter of growth. The references to regional development start on page 17 of the white paper and run out at page 21. Then there is another page and a half on industry development.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague at the table says, it is all done with mirrors in the economic sense. Let us look at some of these structural matters. If we are to create more jobs, I would have thought the government would have come out with some physical program which would assist the development of Australia. I would have thought we would be looking to the four corners of this great land and its natural resources. I would have thought we would be saying, `We'll get ahead of the time here. We'll put a railroad here. We'll support a port here. We'll work with state governments to provide the infrastructure for the future jobs of Australia. We'll encourage private enterprise through the taxation system and be deeply involved in those matters.' But, no. All we get is the sort of throwaway statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made when questioned about Working Nation on a radio program. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You've got to see this, not in terms of the way you help regional areas as by just throwing a bucket of money at them. That's proven not to work. I think what works is regional communities who know what they're doing for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a half-truth. Of course, regional communities have to know what they are doing for themselves. In most instances, they know what suits their region. What they need is assistance in order to complement their own work and activities in regional development. But do they get it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the road program. I do not refer to part of the programs. I refer to all the identified road grants for roads in Australia that are given out by the Commonwealth. I wish to make an interesting comparison. The aggregate of road spending in the years 1983-85 was equal to that of road spending in the years 1991-94. No progress was made in that decade. There was no increase. In fact, in the intervening years, there was a very real reduction in road funding in Australia from the Commonwealth government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, over $2,000 million was spent on road funding, and $1,600 million or $1,700 million was spent the year before. This figure was increased because, in his One Nation program, the Prime Minister promised $600 million more to increase the quality of Australian roads. But, as soon as that year was over, he reduced the amount of funding to the roads of Australia by some several hundred million dollars. It was a fraud. The Prime Minister increased the road funding one year, but he is making up for it by reducing road funding in subsequent years. This year, about $10 million&mdash;a nominal figure perhaps&mdash;is being spent on road funding, which shows the direction of government thinking in relation to the Working Nation document, which is seeking to provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of Australians. Yet, in a comparable document which refers to road funding, the government has decreased the amount of road funding this year in comparison with last year. What a lot of nonsense! Nothing could be more important to Australian development than jobs and a proper transport system, and the government has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not neglect the question of excise. The government might say, `We're short of funds. We don't have the funding for roads that we would like.' However, the government's excise collections have increased from just over $7,000 million last year to $8,000 million this year. So the government has made an increase of $1 billion from the motorists of Australia, but it has decreased the amount being spent on roads by $10 million. It is a fraud. The road programs of Australia have been fraudulent for a long period, and never more so than under this Keating government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, there have been proposals to increase infrastructure. A former premier of New South Wales and a political colleague of the Prime Minister, Mr Neville Wran, is chairing a committee which is looking at the development of the Northern Territory. The economic round-up put out by Treasury just recently contains a report which shows some of the pros and cons of the Northern Territory, which has a great influence on the thinking of my state of South Australia because of the desire to complete the rail link between Alice Springs and Darwin. The report is worth reading. It deals with Darwin as a transport hub. It refers to freight rates, the development approach, the effect on defence and so on. But the government simply ignores this question. It has commissioned a study, which everyone knows is a way for the government to defer for as long as it wants the required facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have yet more prevarication in the face of enormous growth in Asia. The same economic round-up document shows a growth figure for China of just under 14 per cent for the year 1993. Korea shows a figure of over five per cent and Singapore shows a figure of about 10 per cent. We are looking at having a transport link from Adelaide to Darwin. This would be one more connection with one of the most fascinating growth areas of the world&mdash;Asia and South-East Asia. Yet the government has produced this white paper document which ignores all of the major physical development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that we have an enormous amount of debt. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 15 June was headed `Managing Australia's magic pudding'. It was written by Dr David Clark, Director of Community and Business Education. It is a non-politically written article. I am sure Dr Clark wrote it totally apolitically but, as much as he might have done so, the political message is there. Australia's debt has just gone ahead to a degree which no-one would have credited a few years ago. In relation to public debt interests, he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outlays on public debt interest . . . by the Commonwealth are estimated to increase over $1.89 billion over 1994-95 to $7.4 billion. Such outlays will total 7 per cent of total Budget outlays&mdash;only slightly less than what we spend on education and defence and almost half what we spend on health.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the debt structure that this government has created is costing with respect to the capacity of the country to produce services for its citizens. In another excerpt, Dr Clark writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1991-92 and the end of the fiscal year 1994-95, the Commonwealth will have created $51 billion of debt. Further deficits over the next two years will add at least another $15 billion. Assuming an average financing cost of 6.5 per cent&mdash;an underestimate if interest rates rise&mdash;interest payments will add an average $4.25 billion to the Budget deficit bottom line.</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat what I said when I began this dissertation: we welcome any attempt to solve the worst problem facing Australia, and that is unemployment. We acknowledge that a great deal of that unemployment can be sheeted home to the action of this government in this Working Nation paper. The recovery, so far as it has proceeded before the investment in plant and equipment has occurred, is based on debt. I think it is fair to say that this government is as deficient now in its management of Australia's physical resources as it has been in the past. Unless it can produce a plan in that direction, it will fail. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Had those opposite paid more attention to the realities of the economy when they were in government&mdash;as they encourage the government to pay attention to what they see as the realities of the economy today&mdash;Australia would not have had to undergo radical changes in such a short space of time to bring it into this part of the 20th century. We are dealing with the effects of that restructure, which had to occur, as well as a world recession of an incredible magnitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper on employment and growth is one of this government's greatest achievements. It will be recognised around the world as a model of mechanisms for dealing with unemployment. All countries in the OECD face these same dilemmas, particularly the Western countries. This white paper is critical not only to Australia's economic development but also to our social and community development. For the first time it gives all Australians&mdash;in a clear, constructive, comprehensive way&mdash;an opportunity to begin to understand the workings of government and the way government programs can interact across the areas of employment, social security and industrial relations policy. It gives incentives&mdash;imperatives&mdash;to individuals, businesses, state and federal governments and industries to achieve what must be achieved if Australia is to progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition talks a lot about growth&mdash;as well it might. It is being recognised&mdash;by the community if not by the opposition&mdash;that Australia's rate of economic growth is now considerable; it is certainly ahead of that of many other countries we would normally compare ourselves with. Over the last few weeks we have seen the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) attempt to talk down the economy yet again. It seems to be a feature of political life in Australia that those in opposition seek to make the worst of something rather than look at the reality of the economic development that is occurring. We have seen the media take the same approach. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media in this country has a lot to answer for. The approach it takes to, say, news, is an almost dog in the manger approach when compared with the approach of other countries. That same approach comes through with the opposition. Whether it be hares running or whatever the case may be, the media and the opposition continually try to make the worst of the situation rather than focus on some of the positives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence is a key factor in investment and growth. It continues to amaze me when I read newspapers from other countries&mdash;particularly the United States, where the economic situation is in many ways worse than it is here&mdash;to find that the media is constantly looking not only at balanced reporting and discussion, but at ways in which to stimulate the economy. If we in this country had been in such a position, many of the impacts of the recession&mdash;let alone the time we waited to overcome the recession&mdash;would have been eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the white paper in the context of all the work the government has done in the past 10 years. Business, whether it be industries or banks, or whatever the case may be, has never had a more productive opportunity to put its money where the mouth of capitalism is. We now have high rates of growth, a much more skilled labour market, drastically changed workplaces, reductions in tariff and quota protections and restructured industries. Capital market regulations have been relaxed; we have low inflation; we have tax reform to encourage productive investments; and there are more measures contained in this white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry development policies contained in the white paper build upon an environment which is already competitive through not only stable macro-economic and micro-economic policies and competition policies but also through the work that has been done to build competitive firms. It is important for business, particularly at a time when there seems to be some induced destabilisation or panic operating in some of the financial markets, that we focus upon what has been achieved and the strategies that are very clearly espoused within this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of building a competitive environment, the white paper points to the macro-economic stability of Australia today, the micro-economic reform that has been carried out, the export market access programs which have been developed over the past 10 years and which are even further enhanced and refined within this paper, the change in education and training, and the changes in tariff and dumping policies, where both government and business are becoming far more able to deal with some of the more minute differences and changes that occur. This white paper is full of initiatives which go to those lengths. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour market skills and the diversity of the labour market, which are very important in building a competitive environment, are enhanced through measures contained in the white paper. Another key element of the white paper's industry strategies is to build competitive firms. This white paper contains measures on innovation, science and technology, information, networking, the development and focus on leadership and management skills&mdash;one of the greatest weaknesses for many years in Australian business, better access to finance. I congratulate the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) for his efforts in regard to changes made to government purchasing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper contains measures to encourage exports and the focus on Asia.

Governments, treasuries and newspapers from time to time tend to deal with the economy as one great big aggregate. It is not. The Australian economy, like most economies in a large diverse country like ours, is made up of a series of economies. The Kelty-Fox task force went a long way to broadening our understanding of those regional economies and how they contribute to the aggregate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all come from different parts of the country. Different parts of the country have greater strengths and weaknesses, and different parts of the country have been more or less affected by the recession and, indeed, the restructuring that has gone on. The northern areas of Melbourne that you and I represent, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, are the most important manufacturing areas in this country. They have many great strengths. They have a skilled work force. They have good opportunities for growth in industrial areas. They are close to quite efficient infrastructure as well as areas of infrastructure which need even greater development. They have many of the things which have driven Australia for many, many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are people in other states who like to gloat at times and think of Victoria as the rust bucket state, but that could never be further from the truth. It is in Victoria that Australians drive around in Australian cars, wear Australian clothes and eat Australian food. It is one of the great manufacturing areas, but there are also many opportunities for changes and growth in different industries, which can be taken up, I believe, by sensible regional and economic development policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper talks about regional and economic development organisations&mdash;the Office of Labour Market Adjustment and area consultative committees. I believe, as I know you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the importance of making those processes work to help bring finance, business and industry together and to bring the government training facilities and the community together to make those strengths work for us. This area has been not only one of Australia's most productive manufacturing areas but also one of its central manufacturing area for decades, as it will continue to be and grow even further. It has now undergone incredible restructuring, and the people in this area need many opportunities, such as presented in this white paper, to make it strong again. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee met on Tuesday. I vacated the chair in order that the matter be discussed, and clearly indicated to the committee that I would not vote on any subsequent resolution of the committee about this matter. The committee, for the purposes of the item, was chaired by the deputy chairman. The matter was not resolved and a further meeting was held on Wednesday morning and again on Wednesday evening. I am pleased to report to the House that the committee, with me not participating, unanimously resolved as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d)recommends that, except for this resolution being reported to the House and to the Senate, no further action be taken.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, the committee was also very much of a mind to ensure that the goodwill necessary to complete the consideration of the report was not jeopardised by this matter. That is certainly my wish as chairman of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear to the House that I accept the decision of the committee. But as the accused I want to assure the House that I protested my innocence at the charge of breach of privilege. The committee was unable to establish that I had conveyed any one specific recommendation, let alone the 150 recommendations of the chairman's draft report, nor any of the papers or proceedings of the committee. I do freely and frankly acknowledge that I did state, or so-called leaked, the fact that the report was of some 600 pages in length and contained some 150 recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, to be frank, it did not seem to me that I was committing such a terrible crime at the time. According to the guidelines laid down, the committee was unable to find that there had been substantial interference with its work. So the committee has effectively concluded that there was no breach of privilege. The committee has found that none of the persons mentioned on Monday, including myself, has a case to answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sue Dunleavy and Cheryl Critchley are both guilty&mdash;guilty of being genuinely concerned at the very real plight of so many victims of the scheme. They are guilty of seeking justice and equity on their behalf, and they are guilty of taking a genuine interest in the work and future report of the committee. Together with so many of their colleagues in the print, radio and television media, I sincerely thank them, as do countless numbers of our fellow Australians. The committee would never have been able to organise the hotline or the record number of submissions without them. They have set themselves a very simple but absolutely vital task, that is, to inform the people of Australia&mdash;who in my opinion have every right to be informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges, in its report concerning the Public Accounts Committee, acknowledges that not all members or observers share the view that the present rules of privilege should be maintained. I firmly believe that these rules are more appropriate to an age of morse code, but in today's environment unduly restrict the public's access and right to be informed. I invite and urge the Committee of Privileges, having discerned the dissatisfaction with, and the inappropriateness of, the present rules as far as they apply to committees, to review and revise them to reflect contemporary standards and needs and have at the forefront of their deliberations the right of ordinary Australians to have the ability to be informed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, during this inquiry I have, as chairman, encountered what might loosely be described as unintended or intended obstacles to this inquiry. This may very well have been another. But I pledge to you and to all honourable members that I will not be deflected from the task of tabling the committee's report no later than August this year. I will not betray the trust placed in me and my committee by so many of our fellow Australians and, I might say, a Child Support Agency keen to change but looking for additional guidelines for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, this matter has caused the fulsome attendance of members at meetings of my committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interestingly, today the parliament has gained the opportunity to discuss the white paper on employment and growth, Working Nation, a document that may or may not achieve its objectives but certainly one that is extremely important. I have argued strongly that the parliament have more time to look closely at reports and white papers of this nature. I am extremely hopeful that when we return in August we will see the second chamber used much more consistently in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great coincidence is that today we are considering this white paper on employment and growth&mdash;and having a look at some of the subheadings as to how this government proposes to proceed with a financial commitment over four years of $6.5 billion and how it plans to assist small business, social security and many other areas&mdash;and yesterday the Minister for the Environment, Senator Faulkner, refloated the concept of a carbon tax. We are talking in this paper most particularly about addressing the problems of and creating employment for the 900,000 unemployed and, I think it is, the 350,000 of those who are now categorised as long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context we still have people saying we should tax energy. I could not think of a worse possible tax. I might have raised in this parliament before the hypothetical case of our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as a youth being spirited off to Russia to be brainwashed by the KGB for the purpose of sending him back to Australia to enter the political system with the intention of destroying our economy. We now know that the trip was not necessary. But on the other hand, had it happened, I am sure the Prime Minister's advisers and brainwashers in Russia would have told him, `When you get back there, tax fuel, tax transport, tax energy.' Probably no country is more reliant on transport than Australia. We are a very large country that has the huge benefit of having these resources to hand along with other raw materials, which gives us a huge advantage in being competitive in world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just to make sure that the government dumps another tonne of lead in the saddlebags of our employers&mdash;the people who have the best potential to fix this job&mdash;Senator Faulkner gets up and says, `Let's tax energy. Let's have a carbon tax'. I pointed out to the House the other day that there are some great initiatives in Australia in our export effort. I do not know how big it is today, but down in Tasmania there is a major exporter manufacturing wheels for motor cars. This manufacturer has had the good sense to locate its manufacturing facility right alongside the aluminium smelter. It takes liquid aluminium, as I understand it, off the smelter and turns it into mag wheels instead of&mdash;which is so common in Australia&mdash;letting the whole process solidify, shifting it somewhere else, and then remelting it and going through a manufacturing process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner should have got up and said, `We will give tax incentives to people who do those sorts of things'. I do not know why&mdash;the people of Victoria might want to give me some good explanation&mdash;we create steel at BHP in Port Kembla and then cart it all the way down to Melbourne to turn it into engine blocks. It seems to make a lot of sense to me to do it while it is still running. I have been in a major steelworks in Taiwan where they had huge liquid iron carriers that they shifted around the place. It is technologically feasible while it is still running hot to take it over to a plant that creates engine blocks and, instead of delivering billets down to Fishermens Bend or wherever they go in Victoria, make them straight away. We should give tax incentives to people who do that. That is preventing extra greenhouses gases; it is positive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no, this government's mentality is about imposing  more taxes. It wants to use the environment as a revenue raising measure. It has done it with fuel taxes, contrary to its promises in the last election&mdash;in a country where everything has to move on wheels, where there are huge distances between our resources and our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This white paper deals with a regional strategy. It quite correctly identifies our regions as being areas for development where there is a higher percentage of long-term unemployed people. How do we improve their lot by taxing everything that comes into their area?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In Western Australia, a company went to the regional town of Bunbury to make some batteries. It could not stay because all its customers were back in Perth and it was having to freight very heavy commodities back there. It was a good idea, and probably one that would have survived if we did not tax fuel. Why tax fuel in a country the size of Australia? It is silly, but it is revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard the Prime Minister, in his days as Treasurer, admit that the government was hooked on fuel taxes. There has been criticism of the Fightback proposals of the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), our past leader, which sought to remove the tax on fuel. I do not think that was a silly measure. I thought it was an outstanding measure to recognise that, in Australia, it is downright foolish to tax fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are here discussing a paper. We recognise that there cannot be jobs if business is going to be taxed, because business will always be the only creator of real jobs. We can have as many jobs in the public sector as we like&mdash;and there is an obvious need for many&mdash;but they do not produce the things that balance the books. They have to be paid for by the prosperity of the private sector. It is downright foolish on that first account to think that we are even contemplating a carbon tax. We signed a convention to commit ourselves to practices that will be debilitating to any outcomes written in One Nation. It is time that ministers who have given support to this document stopped dreaming up revenue measures that hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I reminded the parliament the other day that $800 of lead in the saddlebag of every car manufactured in Australia is applied through our present indirect tax system. That is not my figure; it is a Treasury figure. Yet we tell people to compete. We are a nation of raw materials, such as bauxite, steel, energy and coal. Why not give our exporters the advantage they need to compete even at home? I have reminded people time and again of people in your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, who have to pay $2,000 per week tax on every semitrailer they use to get their product into Melbourne and Sydney while their Brazilian manufacturing competitors bring their product in on the cheapest transport available in the world&mdash;namely, international sea transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have probably said enough about that, because there are so many other aspects of this white paper that I want to touch upon. We were promised case management. Case management would be an excellent idea in terms of the operations of the CES. My family associated businesses employ about 40 people. I am very conscious of the problems of the unemployed. Not that long ago I instructed my son, who manages those businesses, that we needed a handyman and that we should try to get somebody over 40, who preferably would have been long-term unemployed. There would be a training period in the sort of work that we would want that person to undertake. We were going to teach the successful applicant MIG welding, amongst other things. We thought that the subsidy available would be helpful during that training period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to the CES and wrote a specification which, to my mind, met the greatest need for the unemployed. Four weeks later, we had not had an applicant. I must admit that we had two or three, but they all had jobs. What did the CES do? It typed out a little card and put it in a rack. We thought someone of that age would be better for us in that type of work. In the end, I had to ring up the state director and say, `I don't want to complain, but would you please reconfirm what I hear in the parliament, which is that there are all these people in this older age bracket looking for work.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had our first applicant the following Monday. He is still with us. He went off the subsidy the other day, and we are satisfied with him. He has a good job. But how can people get jobs when those in the system are not ringing them up and saying, `We have a job for you, Smith'? Why does a member of parliament have to ring the state director? When we looked into the white paper and saw the funding allocated for this program, it became a joke. I worked out that the funding was probably $16.4 million. The Prime Minister said that the government was going to case manage 500,000 unemployed people. I worked that out to be $16 per head per annum. I just cannot see how it is going to work. It is silly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But, since then, we have seen ex-Premier Kirner being given a job on a special committee that will bring the private sector into case management. That is a good idea. I have reminded this House before that, some years ago, I attended a briefing from two outstanding Americans whom this government brought to this place for the purpose of advising it on placing single parents into employment. They were a very interesting couple who came from the state of Massachusetts. One was the director of social security; the other, his wife, was the director of the American equivalent of our CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They identified heaps of single parents with qualifications. The husband, who was paying the pensions, called upon his wife and the private sector to get these people back into the workplace. But fundamental to the American bureaucratic approach was putting a price on getting those people back into the work force. They were not paid a weekly amount or a pension. He said to his wife's bureaucratic department and to the private sector, `We will pay you $10,000 if you can train these people and put them back into a permanent job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was working, so the government brought these people here to advise it. But did the government pick up on the fundamental strategy? The fundamental strategy is that an incentive be given to the private sector to get these people back into the workplace. The private sector would also take the loss if it failed; that is private enterprise. No; the government sent them home, having paid a lot to get some very good advice, and ignored it. I do not know whether that is what Mrs Kirner is proposing. On the other hand, it would be a mammoth task if she were to get a job for all those whose jobs she destroyed in Victoria. We should be bringing in the private sector. Of course, $16.4 million for the proper case management of 500,000 people is laughable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some other aspects of the white paper worry me. I missed the opportunity the other day to speak about the pooled development funds. Both the Commonwealth Development Bank and the pooled development funds will be given opportunities and encouragement to invest in small business. It is a noble intention, but a look at the people who need that money will show that it will not work for two reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us first look at the very small businesses. The Commonwealth Development Bank cannot take an equity position in a family business if it is not incorporated. There is a notion called joint and several liability. The Commonwealth Bank, by investing as a partner in those businesses, would be liable for those businesses' entire debt. It would be totally impractical. The government said, `Let them form a proprietary limited company.' After this wonderful statement, we put up the fees for that arrangement in the budget. It is far too complex and difficult for small business. They just will not get into it, so they cannot get the money off the Commonwealth Development Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds involve medium enterprise. Medium enterprise needs a second board of the stock market. That is the sort of thing that governments need to be initiating. I know that that proposal was a disaster last time. That should not deter us from making it good and creating a market so that investors can invest in medium-sized enterprises, which is where the investment has to be. That is where this whole thing fails. It is all about spending money, but not about addressing the fundamentals or doing what the parliament is about, which is writing laws that allow business to get on with what it does best&mdash;employing people. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

There is a call for patriotism. I take note that the Australian flag is still very evident on the opposition benches. I have no problem with the Australian flag and patriotism, but I want to remind the House of what Samuel Johnson said about patriotism in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Boswell's Life</EMPHASIS>, volume one at page 545:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.</PARA>
<PARA>We should always be mindful of this because I believe that there is patriotism and patriotism. There is the cheap xenophobic ethnocentric form of patriotism, which I must say is the sort of thing the opposition has been floating&mdash;suggestions that our Prime Minister is less than patriotic because he wants to encourage a reasonable, mature, responsible debate about our constitutional arrangements, about how we as a country face the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It concerns me greatly that this sort of cheap performance may well encourage the lowest common denominator attitude in our community; it will hardly forward our national concerns and commitment. There ought to be a debate on the flag and there ought to be a debate on our constitutional arrangements. Part of real patriotism is how we forward this country's future. I believe that the white paper is very much a patriotic document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what is stated in the white paper, because I think it is a visionary document. It is a result of widespread consultation with not only the community but also some of the most significant minds in this country and it used the expertise and skills of a broad range of people within the government, in private enterprise and across this country. The white paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to develop the strength to compete in the world and maintain and increase our standard of living, we must make the most of all our resources. Greatest of all these are the talents and energies of the Australian people. When we waste them, we are weakened. When we employ them, we are made stronger. The policies described in this statement are policies for economic and social strength. The two go hand in hand, and with them go more opportunity, more fairness, more confidence and faith in our country and ourselves, more cooperation and cohesion in communities and across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>This is indeed a patriotic statement of how this country ought to run. I also want to indicate that this is the position of not only the white paper but also one of the chief employer groups of this country, the Business Council of Australia. In its bulletin of April 1994 it reports on a national business summit held in March of this year entitled `Investing in Australia's future: achieving the Australia 2010 vision', which has been an initiative of the Business Council.

<PARA>I am interested in the remarkable coincidence between the sorts of statements in the 2010 vision, as outlined by Mr Salmon, and statements in the white paper. Page 3 of the white paper summary document states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the White Paper we have set new national goals: new goals of economic efficiency, new goals for education and training, for our income support arrangements, for industry and for the regions of Australia. We have committed ourselves to a path by which Australia will enter the 21st century with one of the world's most sophisticated and efficient economies underpinning one of the world's most equitable and cohesive societies.</PARA>
<PARA>The key to this, which is made very clear in the white paper and in the Australia 2010 vision, is economic sustainability. I quote, once again, from the white paper. Page 3 of the summary document states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While economic growth is the key, growth alone will not suffice. The experience of the 1980s tells us that growth will deliver jobs to the new entrants to the labour market, and to some of those temporarily unemployed; but the long-term unemployed and the truly disadvantaged will frequently miss out. In this White Paper&mdash;the first White Paper on unemployment in 50 years&mdash;the Commonwealth announces sweeping changes to the Social Security system and landmark new labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA>This has been a great initiative and the outcome of the consultations. In reviewing, as the green paper did, what has happened through the economic cycles of the 1980s, it was quite clear that the long-term unemployed, approximately 500,000 Australians, were not going to be picked up with the new investment opportunities that have obviously presented themselves in more recent times. Therefore, it was of absolute necessity that the government deal with this as a matter of not only social justice but also economic efficiency. That is what many of the initiatives in the white paper are about. That is why over the next four years we are going to spend approximately $6.5 billion&mdash;because just as the government had to kick-start the economic recovery, it has to take responsibility for providing effective training and job opportunities for those people who will not be normally picked up as the economic recovery improves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to make some comments about the opposition's response to the economic good news. It is very disappointing to see the sorts of statements we have from the new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and his deputy, the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in relation to talking down the economy at a time when it is very important that we work together. A basic commitment of the white paper is the importance of government working together with the private sector, the trade union movement and communities right across this country. Here we have the opposition using cheap, political responses instead of basic policy development. I think the opposition leader's petulant performance on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> last night is all of a piece with this. I think it will become clear very soon that unless the opposition is prepared to develop some policies that will work it will be left behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will comment further on just how closely aligned business is with the government's direction. As I said previously, Working Nation is truly a patriotic document, a document that has vision that will take us into the next century and fit us for our position in the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Salmon says in his article, economic security will be elusive unless we as a nation improve the functioning of our economy and increase investment to generate employment. This is one of the most difficult options the government is facing and it was referred to in the National Bank publication <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Decisions</EMPHASIS> of June 1994. An article by Alan Oster, the chief economist for the National Bank of Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are clear signs that the economy has moved up a gear and appears set to kick-up further in the next financial year. The Statistician's latest National Accounts suggest that Australian output/income growth picked up to around the 4% mark in the latter part of 1993 and into early 1994. That growth momentum has in turn reached a stage where hours worked have picked up, and employment is now growing by more than 2% per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>He further states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main missing domestic ingredient in this rosy outlook is business investment&mdash;both the statistician's and the National's surveys point to relatively subdued expectations. Of course, the external outlook is also a vital ingredient. In that regard, 1994/95 growth among the major industrialised economies is expected to pick up to around 2.25%, and in the developing Asian economies to remain around 7%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With business confidence relatively high, private sector expectations improving and a moderate improvement in world economic conditions, we expect that Australian growth could be 4.2% in 1994/95&mdash;slightly lower than government's forecast of 4.5% released in the recent Commonwealth Budget. In composition terms, there are also few differences between the National's and the Budget projections for 1993/94 and 1994/95.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the article he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our latest findings point to both improving business conditions and confidence, together with an important pick-up in capacity utilisation. On balance then, our projections are for business investment to rise by around 15% in 1994/95, much the same as the government's forecasts.</PARA>
<PARA>It is therefore unclear where the federal opposition is coming from. I suspect that its only position is to attempt to talk down the economy in a very unhelpful way. In the short time left to me, I want to congratulate the government on having the vision and commitment to put together a sweeping document that covers income support arrangements and training, which is a vital component. I will conclude by quoting the Chairman of McDonald's:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Australian workforce is expensive and definitely over-regulated, it is possible to make up for those things . . . This is I suppose my biggest emphasis word I want to leave with you . . . it is simply a matter of <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">training, training, training and training</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 7 or 8 years ago, I sort of woke up, I suppose. I realised I was getting nowhere and I said to my people&mdash;hey, if we're to address this problem we have to come around it from another direction&mdash;we have to look at productivity side.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also nothing visionary about the white paper. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia, mentioned that many things were included in the white paper. She might have been right to that extent, but, unfortunately, there was one major missing ingredient: the paper failed to provide for long-term real jobs for so many people who have been out of work during Labor's 11 years in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Working Nation package will cost the Australian taxpayer approximately $6.5 billion. Unfortunately, it is not going to achieve what the government claims. The fact that the government has allocated $6.5 billion in a program which is going to be such a failure is clear recognition that the government's policies in the past have been unsuccessful. It is clear when we look at the white paper that that failure is going to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at the statistics which the government publishes each month to see an indication of Australia's unemployment crisis. Unfortunately, those statistics do not reveal the true picture. The unemployment statistics we receive each month do not include all the people who are seeking work but merely that proportion of them who receive newstart or jobstart allowances. What about the tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of people who do not receive unemployment benefits, people who are seeking work, people who are registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service but who do not receive any form of government benefit, certainly those who do not receive newstart or jobstart or maybe those people who are supported by their families? On the Sunshine Coast alone, there are some 6,000 people in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our official monthly unemployment figures tell us that there are about 14,000 people out of work on the coast, yet 20,000 people are registered with Sunshine Coast Commonwealth Employment Service offices as looking for work. In other words, about 30 per cent of the coast's jobless escape the official statistics. This is one example of how this government fudges figures and, of course, the white paper is yet another. The Sunshine Coast has the most rapid population growth of any region in the country and, unfortunately, we have one of the highest levels of unemployment, estimated at about 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government really should come clean. It should admit the gravity of the unemployment problem in Australia. It claims that there are almost one million people out of work. The reality is that the number out of work would be between one million and two million. This government is being dishonest. I think that is a tragedy and the government stands condemned for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment, though, is much more than a statistical problem. It is a social problem of the greatest magnitude. Loss of a job means much more than a person not going to work. It changes life for the whole family and often causes collapse of the family unit, which is the basic unit in our society. The situation is so grave in my own local area of the Sunshine Coast that the local Sunshine Coast Sunday newspaper recently ran a large feature on unemployment. Among the articles was a letter from a middle-aged woman&mdash;a desperate plea to the community to find work for her husband. It read in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last three years have been horrendous. We lost a child and three other family members, our home, car, his job and many other disasters. Finally after his being out of work for almost 12 months, we separated due to continual stress and he went south to find work. We want to reconcile but unless he can obtain work here it is almost impossible . . . We are not looking for pity or charity. We are both hard workers and believe in honest work for honest pay and we know we are only one family of the many victims of Australia's problems.</PARA>
<PARA>She is so right. Thousands of Australian families are going through similar disasters. Just as unemployment means more than a job loss, employment means much more than a job and a pay cheque. It promotes a sense of worth, self-esteem and pride. Over the last 11 years, more and more Australians have lost their self-respect, along with their jobs. They do not want government handouts, short-term training and retraining schemes; they want jobs&mdash;real jobs&mdash;and the opportunity to put one foot on the ladder of employment, the ladder of opportunity. This is the fundamental flaw in Working Nation. It has no strategy to create real long-term jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reduce unemployment and to create sustainable long-term jobs, we must create a conducive investment climate. We must free-up the labour market, not have the fiddling at the edges we have seen in this parliament recently. We need to encourage the expansion of the small business sector, the most important generator of jobs in Australia. In all of these areas, this white paper fails dismally. It is a fact that if every small business in Australia could be encouraged to employ just one person then we would not have an unemployment rate. This white paper does nothing to encourage those people to take the risk and to spend the money to put people on the payroll and give them an opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not opposed to all of the white paper initiatives. For example, we support the parenting allowance, the introduction of training wages, the shake-up of the Commonwealth Employment Service and the suspension of the training guarantee levy. However, with respect to the latter, we very strongly would seek the total abolition of the training guarantee levy. I believe that in due course the government will be forced to join us in that position. We do not&mdash;and cannot&mdash;support a policy document which seeks to hide more of the nation's unemployed from the official statistics. We cannot support a policy document that seeks to shuffle our jobless from the dole queue to a training queue and then back again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I receive many phone calls at my electorate office&mdash;I dare say that you do, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I dare say that even government members do&mdash;from people who have been sent to many training schemes.

Most people have a friend, a family member or an acquaintance who has been jobless. We all know someone who has been on the dole and out of work. Many people have had personal experiences with unemployment. These people know that training schemes without the creation of real jobs are an expensive waste of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Working Nation tells us nothing about how the government plans to encourage employment growth. Everything seems to be resting on the inflated growth and business investment figures the Treasurer (Mr Willis) forecast in the budget. Economists have already said that the government's growth projections are too high. The point should be made that if investment is going to happen then much of it will be overseas. Of course, that will do nothing for Australian jobs. It really is time that the government stopped gambling and introduced policies which will address unemployment. Better still, let the coalition take over government, because we have policies which will give hope to Australia's jobless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that history will record the white paper as yet another tragic Labor failure. It is important, though, to give industry the incentive to develop, expand and become more productive; to encourage industry to take on new employees; and to create a more flexible labour market by introducing real labour market reform. The government claims to be reforming industrial relations in this country. Of course, that is laughable. We are actually going backwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the industrial relations legislation the government has brought in is simply designed to give the unions more time. All this government has done is to make it more complicated, more difficult and more expensive for employers to take on new staff. Last year's Industrial Relations Reform Act saw to that. The government's industrial relations policies are not getting people back into the work force. We will now have higher labour costs, more bureaucracy, and more rules and regulations. If employers could possibly avoid getting caught up in the industrial relations web that Labor has woven, they will do so. Who would not? In other words, the government's policies will discourage employers from taking the risk; they will discourage employers from putting on people. </PARA>

<PARA>I will very briefly talk about the circumstances explained by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). The particular regulations did relate to the proceedings of the companies and securities panel, which is the takeover panel and a form of peer review on corporations' manners.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it turned out the Senate, on instigation of the shadow Attorney-General, then went this further step and said that it wanted these particular regulations to come forward and be agreed upon before these changes to the law would come into being.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past several years in Australia, ever-increasing pressure seems to have been placed on the family unit, particularly the traditional family unit&mdash;the representative one that most people still belong to, or aspire to belong to, despite some people wanting us to believe otherwise. The pressures on these families, and on non-traditional families, have increased because of the recession that created one million unemployed&mdash;hopefully, we are coming out of it now&mdash;and because of the policies of the present federal government which have resulted in the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, with a gradual disappearance of the so-called middle Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New sexual freedom, the creation of a new value system and many other influences are adding to pressure that is causing the break-up of families. I have heard many people speak of the amount of money spent by the federal government on helping to sort out the `spoils' when families fall apart through institutions like the Family Law Court. In the year 1992-93, $74 million was spent in this area. Keep in mind that this is only the amount spent by the government. If we add the amount spent on the legal profession by former marriage partners, the total cost would be difficult to calculate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency, operating within the Australian Taxation Office and with an expenditure of $56 million in 1992-93, collected $200 million from liable parents. We can see therefore that just in the areas of the family law court and the Child Support Agency, the federal government spent over $130 million in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that we are doing things back to front if we want stable families in Australia. We are closing the stable doors after the horse has bolted. Recently I inquired into the level of funding provided by the federal government to assist families with counselling before reaching the point of no return. We, who are married, or who have been married, realise that both partners have to work at the relationship and must continue to communicate. Sometimes when this communication breaks down, a mediator or counsellor can be of great assistance. That is where family and marriage counselling can assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was made aware of the real need for this service when I came into contact with the Riverina marriage and family counselling service. That service, like many of these services throughout Australia, is underfunded for the work that confronts it. Despite the best intentions of the Wagga Wagga branch, the average waiting time is 2 1/2 weeks. When busy, this can increase to five weeks. When a family faces crisis, these waits may be too long to save the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other counselling services in the Riverina, such as the Catholic Centacare service. This operates out of Wagga Wagga and Griffith, with a visiting service provided to Leeton. These services operate largely on government money, with some money being provided by Centacare and the Catholic Church. Not so long ago the waiting time in Griffith was three months. Thankfully, it is now down to three or four weeks, although that is still too long. The good news is that a service will soon be available in West Wyalong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from federal funding, each client is also charged on a sliding scale according to income. In 1992-93, the family counselling service was provided with an amount of $19 million by the Attorney-General's Department. While this is a substantial amount, it pales into insignificance when compared with the $130 million spent by the government after the family unit has already broken apart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that an increasing amount is being spent on marriage education, but this is reflected in the lowering of the amount spent on family counselling. It is obvious from investigation in my own area of the Riverina that not enough emphasis is placed on family and marriage counselling. I strongly support the work of those people in this area, even though they are grossly underfunded and, in some cases, work beyond their allocated time without pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal more I would like to say on the subject of marriage counselling, family skills training, marriage education and family mediation, but time does not permit me to do so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to express concern tonight about a proposal by the people who currently control the National Roads and Motorists Association in New South Wales to float the NRMA, have it listed and to issue shares to NRMA members. The NRMA was established in 1920 as a mutual organisation for motorists. In 1925 it extended its functions to include insurance. As a mutual organisation, the NRMA currently belongs to the members. So when directors claim that the NRMA will share $2 billion with its 1.8 million members, I emphasise that the 1.8 million members already own the NRMA. They need to be very careful about the implications of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the present time, as a mutual organisation, any benefits which accrue to the NRMA must be distributed to members in one way or another. The way in which they have been distributed is by making sure that the road service is subsidised&mdash;it operates at less than cost&mdash;and that any profits made by the insurance arm of the NRMA are returned to NRMA insurance policyholders by way of untaxed rebates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the NRMA who may be encouraged or tempted to accept the $500 worth of shares should keep in mind that a number of possible dangers are involved. The dividends that would accrue to them in the future as a result of their share ownership would be taxed, unlike the rebates and the other benefits which they get from their current ownership of the NRMA as a mutual organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a very strong possibility that that $500 worth of shares will be subject to capital gains tax. It is certain that, whatever arrangements are made for the $500 worth of shares, any appreciation in the value of those shares will be taxed in the form of a capital gains tax when, and if, those shares are sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a lot of people may be tempted to vote for that change in the expectation that they will then be able to sell their $500 worth of shares and finish up with $500 in their pockets. That may well not happen. If a capital gain applies to those shares, they will receive less than $500. In addition, if those shares are disposed of, there is no question that a concentration of ownership of the shares in the NRMA will become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRMA may fall into the hands of major institutional investors, such as insurance funds and other types of commercial and overseas investors. If, then, under those circumstances, the operation of the NRMA becomes profit driven rather than service driven&mdash;as it presently is as a mutual organisation&mdash;the roadside service will be required not only to pay for itself but also to pay in excess of the cost. This means that the subsidised service will disappear. It also means that the insurance arm of the NRMA will be required to pay as large a dividend as possible to the shareholders, in which case the rebates which have been made available to NRMA insurance policyholders up to the present time will disappear. Those policyholders will have to pay substantially more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRMA itself has put out material which acknowledges that over the past two years policyholders have shared $180 million in rebates. Those rebates will disappear, and that $180 million will go into the pockets of the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that, if the NRMA is spending at least $2 million to promote its preference for the floating of the NRMA, an equal amount of funds should be applied to promote the `no' side of the case so that members of the NRMA are given fair, balanced, objective and adequate information to make it possible for them to make their decision later this year. I appeal to the people not to be hoodwinked and not to be fooled. They should vote very strongly against the proposal, which is simply designed to entrench the present controllers of the NRMA through the arrangements under that corporate structure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to place on record my support for the International Year of the Family and to discuss some of the issues which face families today. It is immensely important that we have a year specifically set aside for the family because society is changing rapidly and we really do need to take a breather and consider what the family means. We have to consider what the family is. There has been heated debate about what constitutes a family and what support government should provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what it all boils down to is choice. We want more choices in child care, job structures, the way we live and so on. Men and women want more choices today than they traditionally have had. More women want to participate in the work force and men are also beginning to re-examine their traditional role. We now have paternity leave as well as maternity leave. The greater availability of contraception is also providing people with more choices. We also have growing choices in child care&mdash;although many would say not enough choices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These choices have an impact on today's families as people try to decide what is best for their family. The government needs to respond to our rapidly changing society and the new choices which society is demanding us to make. We need to support the family as an unit of love, care and support. After all, the family is a highly tuned and effective operation&mdash;the smallest democracy, as they say. The family is responsible not only for the upbringing and care of children and the care of aged family members but also for the support between partners. It is the place where we learn our values, develop our characters and what is important in life&mdash;respect for each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government also needs to recognise the different environments that families live in and apply policies which seek to treat all families fairly. I believe that families in regional Australia have less choices than families living elsewhere. If we live in a city we have a wider choice of schools and child-care facilities and we would probably also have more job choices. Our regional families, especially farming families, are suffering because of the choice they made to live in regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of our farming families are living well below the poverty line. There have been a number of reports into rural poverty. One of them was carried out by the Country Women's Association. The CWA has also been distributing food baskets to rural families. I have heard of a case where three food baskets were gratefully divided between 10 families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural decline is having extremely distressing effects on these families. Imagine the kind of stress it is creating and imagine how farmers feel when they cannot put food on the table for their children. Imagine how farmers feel when they have to ask their young children to work on the farm with them, often working long hours on top of their school work. Imagine how they feel when family members have to leave the farm to find work elsewhere and the feeling of dislocation this brings to the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar circumstances are experienced by city families living below the poverty line. However, the effect on regional families is compounded by the fact that government support is less easy to access. The farming family cannot hop on to the local bus and visit a government department or a counselling agency. We have rural counsellors who are doing a marvellous job but they are running themselves into the ground to help farming families in need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore place on the record my strong hope that the special needs of families in regional Australia are a focus in this International Year of the Family. The government must look at some equitable policies which recognise the specific difficulties of such families. In this, the International Year of the Family, we should be striving to ensure that no family working so hard and for so many days a year should be waiting for donations of food baskets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to end by highlighting some of the encouraging information gathered by my colleague the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), who carries out an immense amount of work on the issue of the family. He points out that 82 per cent of children are growing up in two-parent families, 65 of all marriages will last a lifetime, 72 per cent of households are couple households and over 80 per cent of young people say they do want to marry one day and expect their marriage to last a lifetime. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak on behalf of one of my constituents, a Mr Georges Deane. He is not only an Australian citizen but also a French Polynesian from Tahiti, a French citizen and an ex-member of the French army. He served with some distinction in Vietnam. Mr Deane had the opportunity of visiting his family last year but became ill while he was in Papeete. I am concerned about the treatment he received there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter to the public prosecutor at the Papeete court house in Tahiti he says that on Thursday 26, November 1993 it was very hot at his daughter's house, where he had been staying since he arrived from Australia. He went to bed at about 11.20 p.m., and at 12 p.m., he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I felt the thumping of a fist in my chest and I was out of breath, being able to breath only with difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA>He got his son-in-law to call an ambulance to take him to hospital. I know that ambulance services in Australia would respond more quickly than they do there. An ambulance arrived at 2.15 a.m. and gave him oxygen and injections and took him to Papeete in their vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the trip the attending doctor asked which hospital he wanted to go to. He said, `To the veterans' hospital at Mamao Territorial Hospital'. But that was full, so the doctor then decided to take him to Paofai Clinic and asked whether that suited him. He was suffering from a thumping pain in his chest, so he said, `Yes, I'll go anywhere.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he arrived at the clinic he was carried in on a stretcher and placed in a room where he was given oxygen. During the night he got no other treatment whatsoever. He was visited at 8.00 a.m. on 27 November by a clinic employee who demanded 100,000 French Pacific francs by way of a deposit. He had just arrived at the hospital by ambulance. He replied that he did not have that amount of money with him but he was covered by private health insurance in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That employee stated that the clinic's management would not accept any insurance from outside the territory. Mr Deane said that he was an ex-French army veteran and was affiliated to the veteran fund, but the employee replied that, even with his veteran card, he still had to pay 100,000 French Polynesian francs on the spot or he would not be treated. So the employee called his daughter and told her to come and collect him. She arrived a few minutes later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a long story, and I will not go into all of it. The important point is that Georges was not just concerned about his treatment. At least he had family there. He was a French Polynesian. He was a native of Tahiti. He spoke fluently not only in Polynesian but also in French. He was also concerned about the position of other Australian citizens who might fall ill in French Polynesia and be placed in the situation where, unless they can immediately produce 100,000 francs as a deposit, they may be tossed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had correspondence with Monsieur Gaston Flosse, who is the President of French Polynesia, and the prosecutor. I have also had correspondence with Senator Gareth Evans on the question of assistance to Mr Deane but, unfortunately, nothing can be done. My major concern was that, at that time, we did not have an honorary consul in French Polynesia. I am pleased that, following my letter to the foreign minister, he advised me that there had been an Australian consul in French Polynesia since April 1990 and that the Qantas manager was appointed honorary consul at that time. I had suggested that that would be a good way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, there was a delay with a change of Qantas manager. Even though the foreign minister agreed in April this year to the appointment of a new one, the French have still not approved that appointment. I make the point that, if Australian citizens are going to travel to an area such as French Polynesia, they should not get ill. They will be up for big dollars and many francs. I hope the French do agree to the appointment of the honorary consul as quickly as possible because it is a vital part of the safety of Australians.</PARA>

<PARA>I was curious to see what new policies the people of Australia could expect from the new leader of the Liberal Party. So I delved back to the records of the past&mdash;the records of the Menzies years. I refer to some of the policies which the people of Australia can expect the new leader of the Liberal Party to recycle. In his `forgotten people' broadcast in May 1942, Menzies said:</PARA>

He does not just want to keep Australia as a monarchy. He wants to bring back knighthoods, such as the one that his father had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Please do not think that this is just my imagination running away with me. There is plenty of evidence which indicates that it is not a Downer-Costello ticket, but that it is a Menzies-Downer ticket. The current leader of the Liberal Party went to Geelong Grammar and Menzies went to Wesley College. Both of these schools are part of what the old boys' network calls the `sacred six' of the establishment schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first ever leader of the Liberal Party, Menzies, went to Wesley. The next leader, Harold Holt, went to Wesley. The next leader, Sir John Gorton, went to Geelong Grammar. The next leader was that well-known establishment outsider, Sir William McMahon. Not only did he not go to the right school, but he actually came from the wrong state. This is probably why Sir John McEwen at first refused to have him as the leader of the Liberal Party. Following McMahon, the next Liberal Party leader was that well-known son of the establishment, Malcolm Fraser, who went to Melbourne Grammar, another one of the sacred six. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is not just the schooling; it is also the clubs. The only former Liberal Prime Ministers still alive, Gorton and Fraser, are members of the Melbourne Club. So is Tony Staley, who played hangman for the former leader of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson). Sir Percy Joske authored a biography of Menzies. In his book, he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Menzies has been criticised for failure to provide for talented leadership when he retired from the Parliament . . . however, if Menzies had not appointed A. R. Downer as High Commissioner for Australia in the United Kingdom, the party would, on Holt's tragic death, have had a Leader in the House of Representatives who could have inspired it to future success and prevented the political troubles which proceeded to harass it.</PARA>
<PARA>Was Sir Percy a futurist? Sir Percy was saying that the Menzies mantle would have gone from Menzies to Holt to Downer&mdash;that is Downer Sr, and not Downer Jr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation where Downer Jr strives to fill the shoes of Menzies. Should Junior fill these shoes, Australians can expect a part-time Prime Minister, just like Menzies, who was overseas for months at a time, attending tea parties at Buck House, watching cricket or dining with the House of Lords. The people of Australia should hope that Downer Jr never becomes Prime Minister. I can assure them that one Ming dynasty was more than enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Harvesting of Australia's biggest ever cane crop, with well over 30 million tonnes of cane in the field, began in many centres along the Queensland coast over the last few days. Sugar production in Australia is set to exceed last season's record 4.3 million tonnes, which is worth more than one $1.4 billion. Some 80 per cent of that will come from export earnings. The Queensland industry, which produces 90 per cent of the nation's crop, has 6,300 growers and directly employs 20,000 people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Colourful were the days when the canecutters came to town, creating a robust, if not sometimes fluctuating, economy. The boom and bust cycle of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Summer of the Seventeenth Doll</EMPHASIS> was very much a part of daily life. But in the mid-1960s there was a sea change. Critical to this change in the growth of the sugar industry was the cane harvester. The swinging cane knife was fast becoming history, and my electorate was the cradle of this new harvesting technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leading the revolution has been one Bundaberg company whose founders pioneered the design and manufacture of cane harvesting equipment. Established in Bundaberg in 1947, the Toft family company, of which Colin and Harold Toft were the foremost members, led to the formation over time of Austoft Holdings, which today is Australia's largest agricultural machinery manufacturer. This company is recognised as a world leader in this specialist area of engineering and hydraulic technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, Austoft Holdings celebrated a significant milestone with the company's 100th Allrounder cane harvester, 7,000 series, rolling off the production line in Bundaberg. The 7,000 series was produced in 1984 and sales for the company have topped more than $200 million, with approximately 64 per cent of the cane harvesters produced being exported to 30 countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chopper-style harvester is the Rolls Royce of cane harvesters, with its large capacity and ability to harvest both burnt and green cane in almost all weather conditions. It is a leading item of technology. Last year in Texas in the United States the company claimed a new world record for chopped cane from a single machine in one season when the Austoft Allrounder harvested 125,785 tonnes of cane. Such has been the success and popularity of this series 7,000 machine that Austoft has been able to capture 70 per cent of the world market in cane harvesters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is enormous potential for future growth in the global harvester market, particularly in the Asian region where much of the crop is still harvested by hand. As these economies grow, so too will the demand for capital and Australia, through companies like Austoft, will be in the box seat to take advantage of such opportunities. We have all heard the catchcry that Australia must become a more clever country. Here in regional Australia is an innovative agricultural machinery company which has been doing just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austoft is not just about cane harvesters. While the core of its business remains the design, manufacture and marketing of mechanical harvesters, the company has diversified into a number of areas. Austoft also manufactures self-propelled and tractor trailed infield transporters, plus hydraulic trench digging equipment, notably the Trencheroo and the Diggeroo, which are used extensively by Telecom, electricity authorities and the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this latest success for Austoft Holdings, with the production of its 1000th Allrounder 7000 series cane harvester in Bundaberg is in large part a tribute to the skills and commitment of the company's 370 employees and to its hard working management team of John McGrath, Les Lester, Mal Baker, Greg Weir, Mike Hochen and Noel Searl, to whom I extend my heartiest congratulations and wishes for the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stand in this House during the adjournment debate to once again bring to the attention of this House the incidence of suicide in our nation. On 18 June this year, I was invited to speak at a suicide seminar in the north-east of Tasmania at a place called Scottsdale. Scottsdale and the surrounding area has a very small population of some 3,000. Imagine my amazement when I walked into the room, sat down at the head of the room and then counted the number of people there. There were 107 people representing some thoughts on suicide at that seminar, which seemed to me a very large number. They were a very interested group of people. The seminar was organised by the North East Health Forum, the North East Community House and the North East Task Force. It was funded by the Scottsdale Lions Club, the North East Lions Club, Apex, Rotary and the Leo Club, plus the community house and the task force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the north-east of Tasmania were particularly keen to talk about this subject&mdash;a subject that a lot of people do not wish to talk about. Those who spoke at the seminar included Pat Igoe, who is the mainstay in the Launceston Lifelink; Mollie Campbell-Smith, a coordinator of community forums; Barry Johnson, who has been a youth worker for 23 years, including 10 years as an adolescent counsellor; and also many local interested people whom I will not name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some very interesting information came from the local policeman. He indicated to me some figures that I find rather astounding for such a small community. He said that in this year alone in the north-east of Tasmania there were five definite suicides and two possibles&mdash;the actual cause of death was not identified. In the 5 1/2 months of this year alone, there had been 17 identified cases of suicide in the 003 area of Tasmania. When I stood up to talk to those people at the seminar, I identified my own foster brother as being one of those statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people at the seminar were absolutely stunned by the incidence of suicide. It is an incidence that I have been trying to draw to the attention of people in this place. I hope that they will become aware of it. This morning at the hearing of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I offered some possible terms of reference for this particular issue. I quote part of an article written by Clea Hincks which appeared in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Examiner </EMPHASIS>on the Monday following the seminar. These statements are quite accurate:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmanian males aged between 10 and 19 are almost twice as likely to commit suicide than their interstate counterparts.</PARA>
<PARA>That is astounding. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Researchers based at the University of Tasmania are baffled at the findings that are set out in the latest Medical Journal of Australia, which is published by the Australian Medical Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suicide rate among Tasmanian boys aged 10 to 14 was 1.7 deaths per 100,000, compared with 0.9 deaths per 100,000 on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA>An eminent Tasmanian at the university, Dr Andrew Tulloch, was quoted in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was not understood why the rate was higher in Tasmania than on the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA>He was further quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"There are said a lot of things that need further study."</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same age bracket, mainland and Tasmanian females were less likely to commit suicide than boys, but the study found no significant difference between Tasmanian and mainland girls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Tulloch recommended that support teams be formed to provide immediate assessment and backup for self-harming adolescents and their parents.</PARA>
<PARA>Those things are included in the terms of reference that I offered today. We need to look at what role we can play as a federal government, and what support we can give, not only to those potential suiciders, but also to the families and the survivors of suicide, of which I stand here in this House as one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to talk about the family and the International Year of the Family. On 30 May this year, we had a private members debate in the parliament. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) called upon the political parties in this House to develop policies that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)aim to weld the family together and sustain it through adverse circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)in the taxation area positively discriminate in favour of the family; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)in the operation of the Family Law Act emphasise reconciliation where possible.</PARA>
<PARA>Listening to that debate, I was interested in a comment made by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no role in our society for a government to impose on people its good image of what a good family life is.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that comment is saying that the government is happy to abdicate in regard to encouraging people to live in certain ways. Empirical evidence is coming from the Western world&mdash;Great Britain, the United States and Western Europe&mdash;which indicates that certain family groupings are much more effective for a healthy society than others. It is not a matter of opinion. It is not a matter of persuasion of any political party. It is evidence that is coming through to us that says that children have a much better opportunity in life if they live in certain families. We as members of parliament have to affirm that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this, the International Year of the Family, a lot of statistics have been mentioned. I want to refer to one or two which very rarely get mentioned. We talk a lot about divorce and say that family life is breaking up. The statistics also show that 87 per cent of all first marriages in Australia are still intact. Yet we get the impression from the media and sometimes from government spokesmen that very few families are left intact. It is very important for us to understand that, even though there are difficulties in regard to family breakdown, the overwhelming majority of Australians live in intact families. The benefits which come from living in intact families are numerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research from a study in the United States shows beyond doubt that kids need both parents. The study found that children nurtured in two-parent families receive benefits, such as being six times more likely to live in financially adequate circumstances. The overwhelming majority of children in our country who live in poverty do so because of family breakdown and single parenting. This is not to say that the task of single parents is easy; it is not. We as a society must underpin the needs of those people. But at the same time, we must encourage Australians&mdash;particularly parents&mdash;to stick together, because it is that framework in which children are nurtured and our society will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also find that children in two-parent families are two to three times less likely to have emotional and behavioural problems. They are less likely to drop out of high school, less likely to get pregnant as teenagers, less likely to abuse drugs and less likely to be in trouble with the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a need during this International Year of the Family for us to encourage all Australians to try to live together in families in which two parents are available for the nurturing of children. Far be it from us to say that there is a great diversity of family groupings that are all the same and children will grow up no matter what those groups are because that is just not the case. The empirical evidence coming through from the social scientists right around the world is that children do better in two-parent families. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it appears that, at some point between March 24 and April 26, the government has got into the coalition policy book to find out what a sensible policy the sale of the AIDC might be.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either that or, when they were calculating the budget numbers, they came up a bit short and thought they had better sell something off to make up the difference. What is left of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill is an assortment of bits and pieces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960 stem largely from an external program evaluation of the National Standards Commission that was undertaken by Dr Kevin Foley in 1992. The review found that the commission was orientated more towards short-term objectives and was unable to provide a comprehensive strategic response to requirements of the national measurements system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Foley made nine recommendations, and the amendments proposed in this bill are largely a response to the recommendations and general thrust of the program evaluation. This bill also includes provisions to amend the Pooled Development Funds Act. Pooled development funds, as the members of this chamber would be aware, were an initiative that came from the One Nation economic statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The One Nation document said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has been concerned for some time about the difficulties small and medium sized enterprises can experience in obtaining equity capital. This concern was reinforced during the Ministerial discussions with industry . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The availability of equity can be a critical element for the success of small and medium sized firms. Small firms, however, often have difficulty in obtaining this form of finance because:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">they do not have access to the same range of sources of capital as larger firms, particularly as there is no reliable and easily accessible market for trading equity in small businesses, such as the Stock Exchange</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">adverse economic conditions have encouraged investors to concentrate on established larger and safer enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's response to this problem was to introduce the pooled development funds program. The program was designed to help small and medium sized Australian firms to obtain patent equity capital. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development's 1992-93 annual report explained the nature of the pooled development fund program in the following manner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PDFs provide patent equity capital for eligibility activities in companies with total assets not greater than $30 million, in return for concessional tax treatment. Investors in PDFs can elect to receive either tax exempt dividends or dividends with attached imputation credits.</PARA>
<PARA>The PDFs never worked. The industry department's annual report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date seven firms have been registered as PDFs. Of these, none has raised any capital although two are currently looking to the market for support.</PARA>
<PARA>The tax rate on pooled development funds was originally set at 30 per cent, but at this rate the pooled development funds attracted next to no interest so the government lowered the rate to 25 per cent. This bill before the House currently proposes that the concessional rate be now reduced to 15 per cent, half the original rate.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds have been an abject failure but they are only one of many examples of bad policy that we have seen in recent years from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One Nation, the statement that announced the introduction of pooled development funds, is held up as a model of ill-conceived economic policy. Investing in the nation was, if anything, worse, and the most recent attempt, Working Nation, is the most foolish of the lot, in my view. The changes to the pooled development fund scheme that we are discussing here today were of course announced in the industry statement part of the Working Nation document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways the failure of the pooled development fund scheme is symptomatic of the failure of industry policy over recent years. Pooled development funds were a rushed and poorly researched policy initiative, and that is why they did not work. Industry policy in general suffers the same disease. It is rushed and ill conceived and, at the end of the day, it does not produce the results we should achieve. That is why the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper described the industry statement as `industrial strength waffle'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could list a dozen examples of ill-conceived policy announcement from the industry statement, but today I will spare this government the embarrassment. The actual initiatives announced in the white paper were, for the most part, a hodgepodge of program adjustments and changes that had been building up in the industry department since Alan Griffiths, the former minister, announced the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members present today might be interested to hear a story I was told the other day by an insider. Apparently, Mr Griffiths' announcement of the industry statement was a mistake. We all know that it was a mistake, but apparently he did not mean to announce the actual statement&mdash;it just slipped out one day. So it is no wonder the statement was so full of rhetoric and twaddle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the rhetoric side of the matter, all we heard in the industry statement is that industry policy, in a post-protectionist environment, is all about building a competitive business environment and building competitive firms. This is hardly the visionary policy breakthrough that Senator Cook would have us believe it is, and a definition of industry policy is hardly what business was looking for from the statement. Business wanted to know what the government was going to do to create a competitive business environment and what it was going to do to create competitive firms. The answers to these questions are, respectively: nothing to do and not enough. But that is the way the government works&mdash;everything is done on the cheap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy announcements in the industry statement do not match the rhetoric. On balance, the statement is going to accomplish nothing towards building a more competitive industry and more competitive industry base in this country. It is unfortunate that the government did not take the opportunity when the statement was announced to say, `Sorry, we've got industry policy wrong and it is about time we started again.' As Steve Burrell, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, said in a column earlier this year, someone setting out to create a new public service would not create a monster called an industry department and charge it with responsibility for developing industry policy. It is a shame that the industry department was unable to spot the vital issues that it should now have ownership of&mdash;issues like micro-economic reform, competition policy and regulation reform. These issues desperately need a home in the bureaucracy and business needs an area in government to drive these issues along and keep them on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is a real shame that we are here today debating the changes to the pooled development funds, when we could be debating legislation that actually achieved something positive towards industrial development in this country. </PARA>

Despite what some people outside parliament might think, we know that there is a great deal of bipartisan, uncontentious legislation brought forward.

My congratulations and thanks to all involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill has two parts: to allow a reduction in the Australian Industry Development Corporation shareholding in its principal subsidiary, Australian Industry Development Corporation Ltd, and to increase the number of members of the National Standards Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIDC is a statutory corporation established in 1970. Its function is to foster greater Australian equity involvement in the manufacturing, processing or transportation of goods and natural resources. It is also involved in internationally competitive service industries. Australia has had a generation of economic change. This change is continuing, and AIDC is a major factor in keeping these changes going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The three areas of major activity for AIDC are the promotion of greater efficiency and competitiveness in Australian industry, the reconstruction of Australian industry to achieve long-term viability and competitiveness, and the promotion of new industries or companies that have good growth prospects. Efficiency and competitiveness are the centre and core of any economic policy which can hope to succeed, and productivity is based on these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Productivity is the source of real and lasting high wages and high profits. Economic soundness is really all about pursuit of productivity. Our competitors and markets in Asia especially are very soundly based on productivity. Australia can do it. Our rural sector is extraordinarily productive per hectare. Many of our service industries have made great leaps in productivity in the last decade. Industry as a whole can do the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment bill adds to the government's decision made in 1988. In that year, AIDC faced a capital shortage and went to the capital market by the agency of a subsidiary company, AIDC Ltd. In 1989 AIDC Ltd was partially privatised to raise capital for the parent corporation. However, the government retained 81 per cent of AIDC Ltd. This amendment bill today seeks to lower the government holding to 51 per cent. However, this is not a fire sale. The corporation will hold its shares until it receives a price that reflects the underlying value of the corporation assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation is well run and quite profitable. In 1992-93 AIDC reported an operating profit after tax of $35.9 million. As at June 1993 the Commonwealth's interest in AIDC's consolidated capital and retained profits was $165.5 million. The sale of AIDC Ltd shares transferred to the Commonwealth under the amendments proposed by this bill are estimated to raise approximately $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed new part IVB in clause 5 of the amendment bill will prevent the AIDC holding less than 51 per cent of the subsidiary company AIDC Ltd. The role of AIDC in helping Australian industry is largely unknown outside of specialist circles. However, its work is valuable and the corporation has a good reputation internationally. This is due to good management and the underlying value of investments in Australia and, of course, the underlying wealth of Australia as an economic unit. Commonwealth government guarantees extend to all the corporation's borrowings and other obligations of the AIDC group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the corporation launched a 10-year, $125 million Eurobond issue at 9.25 per cent. This was targeted at traditional European investment houses and it was well received and fully taken up. The AIDC is currently engaged in a review of its clients' requirements to see how it can best expand its range of services and products to meet their demands. Small and medium enterprises&mdash;the real engines of growth and prosperity&mdash;are the principal clients of AIDC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget and the white paper, the government showed its seriousness about initiatives to help small and medium enterprises by raising industry assistance spending by almost 13 per cent; a rise of $409 million to a total of $3.59 billion. These initiatives are aimed at helping the development of internationally competitive firms and overcoming market weaknesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my dealing with the owners and the operators of small and medium businesses, particularly in my own electorate of Lowe, I have heard the constant refrain about access to investment capital. These complaints I accept as valid. Of course, not all businesses have difficulty in accessing finance. However, given the importance for small business of access to finance, the government is adopting a strategy of helping to improve the interaction between banks and small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased competition in financial services has delivered some considerable benefits. However, the increasing complexities of the banking sector and the rapid changes in banking practices have led to some customer discontent. The health and the growth of the economy do depend on the proper financing of our small and medium enterprises. I am glad to see that the Australian Bankers Association has already developed a code of banking practice which relates to personal customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next stage is to examine the concerns of small business with a view to improving that relationship. The government will play a facilitating role in this process. AIDC Ltd is a key element in this government's and private investment's drive to improve our industrial performance. One of the major achievements over the past few years has been the building of a market driven, flexible, responsive, corporate culture to underpin the new strategy of AIDC Ltd. A further significant technological development has been the introduction of the new risk policy approval procedures, in order to ensure that AIDC Ltd can offer its clients the responsiveness to which they are entitled and, at the same time, limit AIDC Ltd's risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The placement of all problem loans and investments in a separate risk policy and procedure division has proved to be a crucial step in ensuring that AIDC Ltd exercises maximum control over its investment portfolios. A great deal has been achieved in containing risk, and this has meant that the rest of the company has been able to concentrate on developing and implementing its new business strategy. These amendments are useful to AIDC. They give it greater flexibility and a more market oriented approach, and both of these characteristics are desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AIDC plans to take an even more pro-active approach to its responsibilities. This is excellent news for the small and medium business community, which provides more than half of all private sector employment, and I am happy to commend this amendment bill to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was a fascinating speech we have just heard. It was completely unrelated to the matter of standards, which is the main subject contained in the legislation before this chamber today: the Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. This legislation deals with changes to the way in which the Australian standards will operate and the way in which the main body which administers standards, the National Standards Commission, will operate in Australia. It relates to borrowing powers and to all areas of the performance of the commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Standards Commission has a twofold purpose. It has the purpose of setting standards for Australian businesses, and it has a process to enforce the observance of Australian standards by Australian manufacturers and producers.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one hand, the government has a responsibility to see that standards are set at a sufficiently high level in our produce and in our manufacture such that they will maintain the proper reputation and reliability of our product. On the other hand, the government has a responsibility to ensure that the conditions and standards which are set are not so onerous as to be a cost impost on the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals before the House do not go to the nub of compliance, nor to the nub of unnecessary regulation and the paper war which is imposed upon small business, mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) in her erudite&mdash;but irrelevant, in terms of this legislation&mdash;speech. So I acknowledge that she has inadvertently opened up the whole debate to let us explore the way in which small business has been dealt with by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement purports to make life more productive and more profitable for small business but, as we have seen, practically none of that statement has been implemented. The government has basically walked away from it and has imposed cost upon cost on small business. If this legislation is abused, the National Standards Commission can make life unbearable for Australian manufacturers and producers by imposing on them precise and detailed requirements which are a cost burden and which are really a process of control and compliance unrelated to the market-worthiness of products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the whole range of compliance with standards in Australia, because I believe it is time that we reassessed this situation. In too many instances, Australian manufacturers and producers are required to observe standards which are in fact unrelated to the needs of the community; yet those who produce overseas need not observe the same standards. The way the process works is this: unless a product is notified to the National Standards Commission or to a state consumer body as being below Australian required standards, those products continue their unimpeded entry into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me recount to the House the situation two years ago when some dried apricots were imported from Turkey. Nobody complained about the quality, but they were far below the quality required of Australian producers. Having got these apricots into Australia, the importer found that there was no market for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that we moved as a nation and had blanket legislation requiring all importers to gain a certificate which indicates that the standard of their import is equivalent to the requirement placed on Australian manufacturers or producers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we should reduce tariffs, but let us reduce tariffs in such a way that like competes with like. We are not prepared to do that. The government has played with this matter for years. I have heard ministers and parliamentary secretaries speak on this matter from time to time. I refer the House to the joint industry policy of the Liberal and National parties that was issued as far back as 1989. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International competitiveness depends not only on price, but also on quality, service, design and reliability of supply. In the final analysis competitiveness, and therefore standards and quality of Australian goods and services, must be determined by the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next Liberal and National Party Government will actively promote a greater understanding of the importance of quality, especially for export purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that most Australians would support that statement. This is where the National Standards Commission comes into the picture. The policy goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that Australian manufacturers are not prevented from meeting the ever-changing needs of Australian consumers or overseas markets, we will remove unnecessary and inflexible, mandatory product standards.</PARA>
<PARA>That is where the government should be paying attention to the needs of small business. If the government was serious about trying to break down the cost impositions that its bureaucracy imposes on small business, it could start to deal with these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government is not going to do that: it is going to let the National Standards Commission go into a brand new world of investment, of freedom from parliamentary and ministerial scrutiny. That is what the legislation says: the government is going to let the National Standards Commission have its head. But instead of the government putting on the check that should rightly be put on the commission by asking it, `Are you being obtrusive? Are you nitpicking? Are you imposing too much on business?' the government is saying, `We are going to free this up and let the commission run its own course.' I think that is a coward's way through this process. It speaks poorly of the minister, and of his understanding of the need for small business to have unnecessary and inflexible mandatory product standards removed. </PARA>

<PARA>I give credit to the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, in so far as that was an area where he applied major pressure. He and Nick Greiner, the Premier of New South Wales at that time, worked together to advance far beyond the position of previous governments in the matter of mutual recognition of standards and mutual recognition of service provided by governments. It was a good move, but I think it has faltered now. I do not think the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is interested in anything much but French clocks and his appearance on the front page and how he gets on the front page each day. I have not heard a statement from him or a commitment from him that he is prepared to advance this cause. Bob Hawke was prepared to.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the biggest stumbling blocks that they face, a great part of the lead in the saddlebags, is to have an unexpected load of a competing product lobbed into Australia, which is of a lower standard and is not required to meet the standards that are imposed on Australians, either by Commonwealth or state legislation. This matter is legislated. Australian producers cannot avoid their responsibility. They will be fined and go to jail if they try to put onto the market a product of a lower quality. The amount of zinc on tin plate, the thickness of tin plate, the strength of welds&mdash;all sorts of standards are imposed for safety and other reasons on Australian manufacturers. We do it every day by legislation and state parliaments do it every day. Then we have got the inconsistency between one state and another. All our manufacturers have to build to what is the highest common denominator of these standards, and that imposes an additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give honourable members an example. If a company is manufacturing cans for the containing of tinned food in Australia it must look around the states of Australia to find which state has the highest standard. The company must then manufacture the tins to meet that requirement so that they will readily flow into the markets of each state. That is a simple proposition. But that procedure, which may be above the safety and health requirements&mdash;they are just commonsense&mdash;imposes an additional cost on that product and on the Australian consumer for the Australian product&mdash;honourable members know the logic of this. However, the importer, unless he is picked up by some alert consumer group or some opposing manufacturer within Australia, can import into Australia scot-free of the standards. It is only if he is picked up by the department of consumer affairs or a consumer group in a state  and then notification goes through to the Australian customs department that the customs department can block the product at the front gate as it comes in. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should add that the honourable member for Banks has been courageous in some of his statements over the last few weeks. He matches the comments that Dr Theophanous has made and that the former minister, Mr Gerry Hand, used to make, but nowhere else in the Australian Labor Party is there the courage to have the government make laws that are in the best interests of Australian manufacturers. In this regard, I need to draw to the attention of the House the work that has been done by Harry Wallace, the President of the Australian Owned Companies Association. I do not agree with everything that Harry Wallace has done or said, but he has endeavoured, with his organisation, to promote the benefits to Australians of supporting their own companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been a number of publications and honourable members will be familiar with the Aus Buy reports listing the companies that they need to buy from in order to support Australian companies. But we do not need to go to that extent. What we need to do is just have a fair situation where the Australian manufacturer or producer competes on the same grounds that apply to the importer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that there are honourable members of long experience in the chamber. I signify the presence of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie). I know he was supportive of the policy of the coalition in 1989, a continuing policy that recognised our need for fairness and consistency. The government has not done that. Under this legislation, as we change the operations of the standards association and we make the amendments to the industry, science and technology legislation, there was a first-class opportunity to impose across-the-board sanctions to imports. That would then be implemented by Customs and every importer would have to produce a certificate saying, `This product that I am importing fulfils the Australian standards.' Nothing could be simpler. It is a simple administrative process and the government chooses to ignore it. Shameful!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise for the first time in the Main Committee and, to use football parlance in relation to the World Cup at the moment, I am not sure whether it is quite like playing away from home or playing at a different time of day but, nonetheless, we will see how we go. Today, we are here to debate the Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which is a omnibus bill which amends the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act, the National Measurement Act, the Patents Act and the Pooled Development Funds Act. I do not wish to speak on the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act today. I will concentrate my comments on the other three acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding the amendments to the National Measurement Act 1960, the National Standards Commission is a Commonwealth statutory authority established in 1950 and operates under the National Measurement Act 1960. The commission has a responsibility for advising the government on the scientific, technical and legislative requirements of the Australian national measurement system and has specific responsibilities for coordinating the national measurement system, for legal metrology, for trade measurement and for the completion of metrification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are to put in place the recommendations of Dr Kevin Foley following a program evaluation of the National Standards Commission. The amendments will expand the expertise available to the commission and bring its administrative functions in line with similar authorities. In particular, the amendments will provide for, firstly, an increase in the number of members of the National Standards Commission from eight to 10, and secondly, for an increase in the limit on contracts which the National Standards Commission may make without ministerial approval from $100,000 to $250,000. Thirdly, the National Standards Commission will be vested with power to invest its money and, fourthly, the National Standards Commission will be vested with power to make grants and provide other financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to these amendments, I say the following: the increase in commission members was a recommendation from the report of a program evaluation of the National Standards Commission conducted by Dr Kevin Foley in 1991-92. The increase in membership will allow the commission to expand its skills, perspective and experience into increasingly important areas such as the quality assurance movement and measurements in analytical chemistry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dollar ceiling on contracts has not been amended since 1987 and now corresponds with the minor capital items limit which is included under the running cost arrangements. Contracts entered into in the past by the commission related to the provision of testing equipment which is funded over a number of years to meet the commission's responsibilities to maintain a testing capability to the international standard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission, which is under scrutiny from industry, and which is expected to pay for the operation of the laboratory, must follow best business practice in the management of funds. The facility to invest funds will ensure funds earned through the patent examination process are maximised, so reducing the need to increase fees. This investment power is in line with similar authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the Patents Act 1990, the amendments to the Patents Act 1990 are extremely minor. When the definition of  the Australian continental shelf was amended in the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 by the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994, there were a number of consequential amendments necessary to bring other pieces of Commonwealth legislation into accordance with that definition. The Patents Act was inadvertently omitted from that list of acts. The proposed amendment seeks to rectify that omission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the act that has probably attracted the most interest in the debate today and that is the amendments to the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992. The PDF program introduced by the government in 1992 is designed to encourage the provision of patent equity capital to small and medium sized Australian businesses whose primary activities are not retail operations or property development. The Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 enables the registration of companies that will provide long-term patent equity capital to small and medium sized Australian companies. The PDFs and their shareholders receive concessional taxation treatment. The program gave effect to the initiative announced in the One Nation statement designed to alleviate the problems experienced by small and medium sized Australian firms in obtaining patent equity capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become necessary to increase the time period in section 24(5)(b) of the Pooled Development Funds Act during which audited statements are applicable. The purpose of specifying audited statements under section 24 is to establish a mechanism for a PDF to verify the size of the potential investee company. This is important because a PDF may not invest in a business having total assets exceeding the limits specified in the PDF Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the existing wording of section 24(5)(b) of the PDF Act is that it prevents all registered PDFs from investing in established businesses during the period from 1 July until about the end of October each year. During this period current audited statements that are less than 12 months old generally are not available to be used to determine the size of the investee company. Section 24(4) requires that the last audited accounts of the investee company are to be used to determine the size of that company before a PDF can invest and section 24(5)(b) requires that the last audited accounts must relate to a period that is less than 12 months before the investment is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PDF Act does not provide the board with any discretion in this situation to approve investments that do not satisfy this timing constraint. Therefore a change in the legislation is the only practical solution. For example, if a PDF wishes to invest today in an established business, the business would have audited accounts for the financial year that ended on 30 June 1993. These accounts are acceptable as they relate to a period that ended less than 12 months before the investment. However, on 1 July 1994&mdash;in only a couple of days&mdash;these same audited accounts are no longer acceptable under section 24(5)(b) as they relate to a period more than 12 months before the date of the investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some four to six months from 1 July the investee companies will not have available audited accounts covering the year ended 30 June 1994. Therefore, during this period PDFs cannot invest in such companies. It is commercially impractical and would be expensive to require a potential investee company to undertake a mid-term audit just so a PDF can invest in this time period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extending the time period under section 24(5)(b) from 12 months to 18 months solves the problem. Companies under the Corporations Law are required to produce annual audited accounts for the most recent financial year within six months of the end of that year. Implementing this change will have the result that current audited accounts will always be available at the time of a PDF making an investment. This is not tinkering at the edges, as the opposition suggested in the Senate when the bill was debated there in May. It is correcting an unforeseen administrative consequence of the original act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial response of investors to the PDF program was disappointing. However, the government has remained committed to the objectives of the program and has reviewed the program after consultation with industry groups. The government identified a gap in the market supply of patent equity capital for SMEs and set out to address that problem. However, it takes some time from the introduction of a new program until the private sector responds and commences operations. Also, it is difficult to determine the correct balance of incentive required to encourage investors without being overly generous. The government, in announcing the further changes in the white paper, is acknowledging that there is a need to be more generous than originally thought necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eleven PDFs are now registered. Three PDFs have raised $35 million between them and two of the PDFs have either invested in or committed all of their available capital to eligible businesses. The other PDFs are positioned to respond quickly to the white paper changes once they are enacted.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the announced changes new PDF registration applications are being received by the PDF Registration Board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of a review, the Prime Minister announced in the white paper a number of changes to finetune the program. The main features of the changes are a reduction in the rate of company tax from 25 to 15 per cent on the profits a PDF derives from investing in businesses and a relaxation of the PDF operational rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other initiatives include improving the flexibility of the PDF rules by increasing from $30 million to $50 million the total asset limit of companies in which a PDF may invest; increasing from 20 per cent to 30 per cent the proportion of raised capital that a PDF may invest in any one business; giving the PDF Registration Board a discretion to allow PDFs to invest in excess of the prescribed 30 per cent limit in any one SME investment, so long as it can be established that this is not intended to avoid tax provisions and the PDF agrees to meet the prescribed limit within an agreed time frame; removing the restriction that PDFs may not invest more than five per cent of their capital in start-up enterprises; and raising the limit on ownership in a PDF by investors, other than banks and life offices, from 20 to 30 per cent while maintaining the board's discretionary power to vary this restriction. Bank and life offices may own up to 100 per cent. The revised arrangements will improve the access to capital by small and medium sized Australian companies and address imperfections in the capital markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak in general terms now on the subject of industry policy, which the previous speaker, the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) entered into. Industry policy is essentially a balancing act. It is about setting parameters and encouraging investment but also about certainty and security being in place so that the private sector, which must be the basis for this investment, knows what it is dealing with, what the projections are for the future and how it can understand clearly when the government will and will not provide assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this government's point of view we have tried over the years to adjust our policy to the needs of business. We have not always been successful but we have always tried to do that in a way that provides certainty, in a way in which the system is designed so that that assistance that we are able to provide is structured to affect those industries which can use it and whereby we maximise the advantage to the country. I really stress that question of certainty and continuity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The danger that we see in the opposition at the moment is that we have a situation of no policy whatsoever and, quite often, differing views are announced. As we all know, this Committee and the main House are forums where members of all sides can raise issues of concern to them and can expand the dimensions of policy debate and be in a situation where a range of issues can be covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views within the opposition are often quite markedly different. The former opposition leader (Dr Hewson) and the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) both have a view that tariffs must be cut. They have stated that view many times and of course it was a major part of the Fightback program. </PARA>

Then, only recently, the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was saying that we need to increase tariffs; tariff increases are what we should be promoting. Probably the best example at the moment of that is the new opposition leader, the man for all seasons, Alexander Downer. The media commentators and honourable members on this side of the House have picked up that he is trying to be all things to all people at all times.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Downer also criticised the movement of Australian businesses offshore. Yet he said he was not opposed to it, and acknowledged that economic internationalisation was "inevitable". He also indicated support for government financial deregulation and rejected any return to greater tariff protection.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Downer said the solution to increasing foreign ownership of Australian assets was an increase in national savings, but has not revealed his policy for boosting savings. He said the solution to Australian business moving offshore was more competitive tax regimes, infrastructure and (presumably) labor markets.

The comments that have been made, and were raised last night with Kerry O'Brien, about the question of interest rate policy and that question about certainty and continuity in policy are an issue for the country as a whole.

The coalition will be supporting this legislation. I would, however, like to take the provisions of this bill slightly further and consider the government's general approach to Australian industry. I intend raising only a couple of points and I will keep my contribution relatively short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the government's almost complete reliance on Australian industry to underwrite the cost of its `hide the dole queues' scheme, it would seem likely that it would be doing everything possible to assist business in whatever way that it could. One would expect a reduction in the burden of taxes, charges and regulations which are imposed on businesses and industry. One would expect certain incentives to be offered to business to grow and expand. One might even expect a stable policy environment to allow long-term planning by business and industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the exception of the temporary suspension of the training guarantee levy, this government fails on all three counts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, it has stolen it but, unfortunately, it does not have the guts to go all the way and abolish it totally. Of course, that is the tragedy of this government. It has not got the guts to bite the bullet on many of these issues. One of the great impediments out in regional Australia is the fact that many businesses out there pay higher salaries to attract skilled workers to the area. So they have a greater commitment&mdash;a tax liability, one might say&mdash;in the area of training guarantee levy, workers compensation, superannuation, payroll tax, all those taxes which are taxes that this government seems to think business can pay and still survive and make a profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry in Australia is still overburdened with the payroll tax, albeit it is a state tax; the superannuation `tax', because it effectively becomes a tax on businesses; and wholesale sales tax. We know that in the budget of last year wholesale tax rose one per cent across the board, and it is going to rise again this year. It is yet another tax on businesses. Day after day, government members come into the House and say that they have achieved this year's budget without any increases in taxes. They fail to remind their constituents and the Australian consumer generally that they put up massive increases in taxes in the 1993 federal budget, and those increases are still impacting on and still having implications for industry this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Industry is lumped not only with the cost of these taxes, but also with the administrative headache of meeting pedantic, inflexible and unrealistic guidelines and regulations. On the subject of incentives, the federal government has in the past offered a very useful and effective incentive to invest&mdash;and we acknowledge that&mdash;in the form of the general investment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This allowance of 10 per cent was taken up by many of my constituents in the electorate of Maranoa, and I am sure it was taken up in many electorates around Australia. I have heard many good reports from other parts of the country where the allowance has been particularly useful to small and medium sized enterprises in regional cities and towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the downside, the allowance was plagued with bizarre and confusing regulations which prevented many genuine investors from accessing the benefits to which they were entitled. I would like to refer to two particular cases in my own electorate, and I am sure there are many members on the other side of the House who have had these pedantic regulations brought to their attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One case involved a motel operator who sought to upgrade the airconditioning facility in his establishment. Generally speaking, that would have entitled him to the 10 per cent investment allowance. However, because he runs a motel and not a factory, the new airconditioning systems were required to be installed as a number of separate units. Unfortunately, each of these units cost less than the threshold $3,000 at which the 10 per cent investment allowance would apply. So even though his investment outlay came to well over $50,000 to aircondition the motel, because each individual unit cost less than $3,000 he was not entitled to the 10 per cent investment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure members on the other side of the House would have to say that that is a clear anomaly in terms of the intent of that investment allowance. Had that airconditioning consisted of a single unit worth $50,000 then that motel operator would have been entitled to the 10 per cent investment allowance. I do not think that was the original intent or the spirit of the legislation; however it is what investors out there have had to live with. It is another one of those pedantic rules that perhaps have been drawn up by Treasury or the bureaucracy. That rule has meant that many potential claims on that investment allowance have been disallowed because they simply did not fit within the black-and-white regulations applied by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second case involved another genuine investor who was discouraged by inappropriate excessive regulations. It relates to the purchase of a crop-dusting plane. A number of cotton growers in my electorate have struck the same problem. Despite their wishing to upgrade their equipment and, in so doing, contribute to a multimillion dollar export industry and create jobs in country and regional Australia&mdash;and also in the cities because many of these flowthrough effects come through to the cities&mdash;the government is simply not interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the investment allowance guidelines, aircraft are excluded without exception. One would have to ask oneself: why without exception? There is no special consideration for those used predominantly, or even exclusively, in industry. Yet a plane such as a crop duster is not a plane in the sense that many of us would use planes and know the use of aeroplanes. It is a piece of machinery; it is equipment or plant. It just so happens that it is used in the sky, rather than on the land or built into a factory. Crop dusters are expensive, and especially designed for that purpose. They are not pleasure craft. The decision to purchase is driven by commercial considerations only. Yet, for reasons unknown to this government, they do not count as a genuine investment in terms of the spirit of the investment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would strongly encourage the government not to wind up this 10 per cent investment allowance on 30 June. I know, looking at the date today, that we have one day left to change this; and I guess we are not going to see this occur. But the scheme should clearly continue if we are to encourage investment in industry and encourage industry to upgrade its plant and equipment. It would assist Australian businesses to become more competitive and more able to cope with an international, globalised economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another good reason why this investment allowance should continue, and I will relate that issue to my electorate of Maranoa. For the last four years unprecedented drought has plagued my electorate and many parts of Queensland. Many of those people who would dearly love to upgrade their plant and equipment have been unable to do so because of the effect of drought and the lack of cash flow. Those people are going to have to wait for a real break in the season to get some cash flow and confidence to go out and invest in new plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we speak in this chamber today, the drought is still with us in Queensland; it is spreading through New South Wales. But I refer particularly to the situation in Queensland, where these people, and many of the agricultural industries which would have liked to have upgraded in the last three or four years, more particularly since the introduction of this 10 per cent of investment allowance, have not had the cash flow in their business because of the drought, and certainly have not had the confidence to go out and invest whilst the drought continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That would have been a very good reason to extend this 10 per cent investment allowance to those areas which have been plagued by drought and have been prevented, because of drought, from considering the upgrading of their plant and equipment and obtaining this 10 per cent investment allowance. They have been particularly disadvantaged by climatic conditions which are totally beyond their control, but I think that would have been something that the government could have at least considered in the preparation of the budget this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite simply, this issue is about being flexible. We must stick to the spirit of the legislation and not to the infinite degree displayed in the past. I do not advocate a flexible approach at the expense of accountability. Schemes such as this obviously need to be administered and monitored with transparent and thorough scrutiny. However, if that scrutiny is provided through explicit and inflexible regulations, as I have described, that strangle the purpose of the scheme, the potential benefits to industry and Australia generally will be neutralised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is room for both scrutiny and flexibility. If Australian industry is to be resuscitated, the government will need to find that happy medium. Unfortunately, I know that we have only a day left for any changes and that we are not going to see those changes. It is very sad that the government has not considered some of the requests that have come from the business groups around Australia and addressed some of the anomalies that I and we on this side of the chamber see as clear anomalies in the spirit of that 10 per cent investment allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer those anomalies to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay). Perhaps at some time in the planning for next year's budget there will be a reconsideration of the investment allowance. The government will only have one more chance to do so, as there will only be one more budget before the next federal election, and that will be the last budget that we will see from the Labor Party for many years. They ought to address this in the spirit of trying to resuscitate business investment in Australia, and I hope that the parliamentary secretary ensures that in his discussions he does take up that issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the legislation before the chamber, which is the Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. As we have been having a fairly wide ranging debate, there are a couple of issues that I want to raise in relation to this, because the bill itself deals with national standards, the national standards of companies and industry, and with pooled development funds. It is on those areas that I would like to make a few comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the industries in Australia that has performed very well when it comes to national standards is the pulp and paper industry, which is probably one of the most maligned industries in some of the debate that has gone on in Australia. The pulp and paper industry had to undertake the restructuring and economic reform necessary to achieve international competitiveness and to achieve world standards. To this end, I must commend the employers and the union movement. The CFMEU, as a union, voluntarily entered into negotiations with Australian Paper Manufacturers back in 1988 and worked with that company to introduce major structural reform in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reform has not been without some penalty. In the short term, there have been job losses caused by reduced manning levels resulting from such changes, and this has impacted on many industries across Australia. For example, at Maryvale in my electorate, the APM company&mdash;Amcor, as it is known today; the largest pulp and paper mill&mdash;shed 330 jobs in the period between 1988 and 1993. While voluntary retirement packages and natural wastage factors were of initial concern to members, greater employment security, increased skill application and resultant job satisfaction have all contributed to real productivity gains and a more competitive workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the restructuring commencing, the mill produced about 600,000 tonnes of pulp and paper and had 1,260 employees. As of 1 July last year, 800,000 tonnes were produced&mdash;which is an increase of 200,000 tonnes&mdash;by just 930 people. Improving productivity generally means producing more with the same number of people or producing the same amount with fewer people. At Maryvale, cooperation between the union and the company has resulted in the mill producing more with fewer people&mdash;which is a common occurrence in Australia today, particularly since about 1988. The cost of production at that mill is now four per cent below that of three years ago. Taking the consumer price index into account, that is an effective reduction of 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has not all been good news, however; there is a downside to this. State government charges increased by 11 per cent and took some $5 million of the savings that had been achieved by the changes. The state government, of course, is responsible for the supply of gas, electricity, crown wood, rail transport and various taxes. It is in that area that I think we are still to see, in our region, the real changes that are required to make the restructure effective for the community, and to replace or do something about those 350 jobs that went from that one workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not yet seen the flow-on from the state government for those gas and electricity prices. The savings have not been made available to industry as they should have been if we are going to get investment back into Australia. However, improving international competitiveness by restructuring workplace reform is not just about reducing employment numbers. It is also about management practices, training and retraining, multiskilling and continuous improvement; and occupational health and safety practices are very important. The CFMEU has been very much to the fore in this regard, and the union and the company are to be commended for their approach, which has enabled change to be understood by the members and employees, who consequently have been capable of effective implementation of that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We always hear from the opposition that these things are not happening in Australia and that there is no labour reform; but the opposition just refuses to look and see that it has been taking place. I refer in particular to an area that I represent. I will admit that the Latrobe Valley probably has had in the past one of the worst reputations in Australia for industrial relations. Today, we are a shining light of change. We have industrial agreements in place and we intend to publicise them as much as we can. Hence, at every chance I get in the parliament, I will be raising these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other than the original occupational health and safety agreement which was negotiated with the industry back in 1984, the three most important agreements negotiated in the period since 1988 are the restructuring, training and enterprise agreements. Those are major items for Australia today. The restructuring agreement had the effect of reducing manning levels, as I have said. However, it also provided for retraining, transfer to other duties and acceptance of greater responsibilities. As a result, there is now wide acceptance and practice of multiskilling throughout the mill and, in the production area, employees are now responsible for the production process in crews of each of the mill's 13 operating units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the occupational health and safety area, the major employers in that industry signed an agreement on occupational health and safety in 1984. However, it was not until the establishment of a special occupational health and safety unit in 1990 that there was any dramatic improvement in health and safety of the workplace and resultant reduction in lost time through injury. The agreement by APM to participate in the funding of the OH&amp;S unit contributed significantly to the participating companies' efforts to be internationally competitive and to raise their standards. There is evidence now that the union's intervention at that time resulted in improvements in health and safety. From 1984 to 1990 lost time injury rates at the Maryvale mill have fallen significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of training, the overall object of the training agreement at the mill is to improve operating effectiveness of the mill and thereby increase productivity, increase competitiveness and improve job scope, responsibility and security. As mentioned previously, training and retraining was a major component of the restructuring. It remains an essential component in all further efforts to increase productivity. The agreement has been the vehicle for multiskilling and acceptance of greater responsibility in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three key factors in the agreement's general approach. First, it is acknowledged that training is a long-term investment and not a cost. The return on that investment will be through improved operating effectiveness. Secondly, the effective development and implementation of training proposals require a consultative approach by all parties, and we have that. Thirdly, employees will be paid for skills attained and used by an employee within the mill according to agreement, and the parties have agreed to remove barriers to the utilisation of skills acquired. Fourthly, all employees accept that they have a responsibility for teaching others as part of their normal duties according to past practice. While it is acknowledged that training is a long-term investment, productivity gains at Maryvale have already demonstrated its worth in the short term. This is further evidence that the policies being put in place by this government are working and will continue to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me move on now to the enterprise agreement. In an effort to improve this country's overall competitive trading position, the federal government has encouraged industry and unions to enter into enterprise agreements which recognise the need for industry in this country to bring its costs more closely in line with overseas competitors. Given the restructuring experience of APM and the CFMEU and the union's involvement in councils, studies and inquiries, this challenge was taken up readily and negotiations entered into for the first enterprise agreement in the pulp and paper industry. This agreement, now signed by both company and union, commits the parties to a range of measures leading to real gains in productivity, efficiency, competitiveness and attainment of world standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key objectives of the agreements are, firstly, to align the company's cost structures more closely with those of the company's major competitors. In particular, the unions and employees commit to the objective of reducing the cost of labour over the two years of the agreement by 10 per cent. Such reductions may occur by several processes, namely, improved operational efficiency through improved skills and dedicated work teams; improved work flexibility; improved manning productivity; improved commitment and adherence to quality management principles; and other productivity; quality and service measures as appropriate to the objective. They are also to become more flexible and responsive to the requirements of the company's customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union and the company have agreed to adopt the broad approach to productive performance and incorporate management and labour efficiency, quality training and equity issues. Individual mill agreements will detail specific measures for such key issues as working to the full range of skills, removal of demarcation barriers and the acquisition of vertical and broad skills. In addition, consequential agreements on training and occupational health and safety are recognised as key elements and measures to enhance productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on the success of this cooperative union and company approach on micro-economic reform, Commissioner Merriman of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What has been occurring at APM Maryvale is a substantial development in cross-skilling and a development which a short time ago would have been placed in the too hard basket as being an impossibility. What is occurring is a significant example of award restructuring, work place consultation culminating in the removal of previously high impregnable barriers. The training and development program now in place, following constructive negotiations, demonstrates Australian ingenuity and a dedication to productivity improvement.</PARA>
<PARA>As can be seen from this statement, both the CFMEU and the APM have invested considerable time and effort in a range of measures to improve productivity and overall competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is somewhat of a tragedy to come into this parliament, both this place and the main chamber, and hear so many members opposite saying that nothing is happening in labour reform. If there is to be a judgment made of our opponents at the next election, it will be that they continue to be out of date, out of time and out of step with the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is occurring at APM Maryvale is also occurring right across the Latrobe Valley region in my electorate. The industrial agreements are all signed. As I said in the other chamber last night, within six weeks we hope to be demonstrating to the world, and to Australia in particular, that this region has turned the corner on the dark days, as we used to talk about them, of the environmental and industrial relations problems of the Latrobe Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to get out and demonstrate that. We need to get out and start talking about pooled development funds. What we need in Australia, more than anything else, is confidence. As my colleague the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) said, `Talking down the economy is not the way to get Australia into the world market.' I do not think it is doing much for the opposition to continually talk down against the facts&mdash;to keep saying that labour reform is not taking place and that nothing is happening. All that the opposition is saying to many investors, who probably do not know any different at this stage, is that things are not occurring. Members opposite are not doing any good for themselves or for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds and the measures that have been introduced by this government to make them attractive will not work of their own. It certainly will not work if the message that is going to the people who make these decisions is that things are not right in Australia. Let me give honourable members an example of this. Three months ago Mission Energy invested $1.4 million in the Loy Yang B Power Station in the Latrobe Valley, which is in my electorate. There are 52 banks involved in the funding of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Mission Energy opening there were people from all over the world. I sat next to a person who had worked in the Latrobe Valley 15 years ago. He is now the leading person in that organisation in Singapore. His knowledge of what was happening in the Latrobe Valley was 15 years old. He still believed we were uncompetitive and that we had not changed. We were talking about Mission Energy's ability to go into East Java and build a similar power station. He was looking for contract workers and skilled people to assist in that development in Indonesia, but he said to me that Australia would not be in it because we were not competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had to very quickly get to work on him and inform him of the change that has occurred in Australia and of what is now taking place in Australia. The people in the public arena, and in this parliament in particular, who keep reporting that things are not changing are doing a great disservice to Australia. We realise that we have a problem and that we have to get out and correct it. We have to make the changes that are needed to change the world's perception of what is happening in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people in Australia prepared to do that. People on this side, certainly, are out there doing their very best. Our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is in Indonesia this week continually working towards this. The plea that I would make is for the opposition to come on board and to be part of Australia. Opposition members should acknowledge what is occurring in Australia. They should acknowledge the benefits of the pooled development arrangements that are there for investors in Australia. They should acknowledge the reform. The evidence is quite clear. It is available for them to see. They should get on to some constructive thinking and some constructive policies that may help Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their leader was on television last night saying that all will be made available in the next election campaign. That will be much too late. The Australian people have never, ever&mdash;in my experience&mdash;got it terribly wrong when it comes to making the judgments in relation to who should govern them. They have got it right now, they have for the last 13 years and they will continue to get it right, I believe, in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gives me great pleasure to support the legislation that is going through the parliament. I believe that national standards are very important. I believe that the development funds act is extremely important but the whole lot must be seen in context. When it is seen in context, not only by the members of the opposition but by a lot of the people that they talk and deal with, a little more confidence coming from them and a little more reality could have a great impact upon how investors think about investing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is certainly well on the way now but investors still need encouragement. They still need the confidence that things are in place and are working. I believe that, if we keep working at it and keep a solid program going that brings this information out to the people and if everybody takes every opportunity they can in this chamber and other parts of the parliament to notify this, our investors will start to realise. I believe they are realising now but they will move much more quickly to put in place the funds that are required to generate the opportunities that Australia has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are certainly having a broad ranging debate on the Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 this morning. We listened to one of the government speakers a while ago talking about the Australian Industry Development Corporation. I would have liked to have come in and spent 20 minutes talking about it as well. We are reducing the public ownership of the subsidiary company which I am sure is going to bring to light some interesting outcomes down the track with its ownership, or part ownership, of the Australian Submarine Corporation. That is not what we are talking about here this morning, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I say, we are having a broad ranging debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have listened to the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Griffin) talk about business investment and foreign investment in Australia and the comments from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). We have also listened to the honourable member for McMillan (Mr Cunningham) talking about training as a part of what I understood to be an enterprise agreement with APM. That reinforces the comments that the opposition was making yesterday in the main House on the debate on the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will get back to the bill that is before this Main Committee this morning. The Industry, Science and Technology Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 has a number of measures. It amends the National Measurement Act; it amends the Patents Act and, most importantly, it is another amendment to the Pooled Development Funds Act. Yesterday we debated the Pooled Development Funds Act in the main House of Representatives chamber. The parliamentary secretary's speech on the second reading&mdash;I presume that is who made the second reading speech&mdash;referred to the pooled development funds and the size of the investee companies. That was amended yesterday but I presume it has still got to go through the Senate. I will come to that in a minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill that is before the Main Committee today amends the National Measurement Act by providing for the following: there will be an increase in the number of members of the National Standards Commission from eight to 10; there will be an increase in the limit on contracts the National Standards Commission may make without ministerial approval from $100,000 to $250,000&mdash;and we just presume they are not going to be using the Australian government credit card in those areas; the National Standards Commission will be vested with power to invest its money; and the National Standards Commission will be vested with power to make grants and provide other financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Patents Act 1990 is amended to make minor technical amendments which are consequent to the amendments made to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 by the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994 (No. 20 of 1994). The Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 now contains an express definition of the Australian continental shelf; thus reference to the continental shelf convention and the Patents Act 1990 are no longer appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is following on from our commitment to another international convention. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the coalition is very concerned about the number of international conventions that Australia is becoming a signatory to without any reference to the Parliament of Australia. The fact is that the governments of Australia&mdash;not just this government, but consecutive governments over a period of time&mdash;have signed in excess of 2,000 international conventions. At the same time, the United States of America, which the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was holding up as a great role model and was tugging his forelock to the other day, has signed somewhere in the vicinity of only 300 or 400 international conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been suggesting to the government that those conventions should be subject to the scrutiny of this parliament, and they should be debated in this parliament before the government signs them. That has resulted in the amendments to the Patents Act. The amendment to the Pooled Development Funds Act is probably one of the more important aspects of this bill that we are debating this morning, and it is certainly one that has drawn the most attention of speakers from both sides of the chamber this morning. It is terribly important, because we are talking about the future of this country, and about incentives and encouragement for small to medium enterprises and large enterprises&mdash;but mainly small and medium enterprises&mdash;to go on, develop, invest and generate more employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As was set out in the main House yesterday, we are not opposing the measures that the government is making. We are not talking things down as the member for McMillan implied a while ago. We are purely doing what any professional opposition would do. I am sure that the members of the Labor Party, when they return to opposition&mdash;and they will one day&mdash;will do the same thing, because an important element of government in Australia is a strong opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member objects, but it is an opposition's job to highlight areas where the government could improve its performance, and the government has proven to the people of Australia with the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill last night that it can improve what it is doing in Australia by taking note of policies that the opposition has put forward. We were going to abolish the whole thing, but we will come to that later on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is important that an opposition highlights to a government areas in which the opposition believes the government can improve its performance. If that means talking about changing fiscal strategies and talking about interest rates and what the downstream effects of current policy may be, so be it. But it is not a case of talking the economy down or talking interest rates up; it is about highlighting to the government some of the inadequacies that we believe it has in policy areas, and it is done in a positive spirit, not a negative spirit. I refute the arguments put forward by the member for Corinella and the member for McMillan who implied that that was actually the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 is amended to extend from 12 to 18 months the period to which the most recent audited accounts of an investee company must relate for the purpose of determining the value of the total assets of the company before a pooled development fund invests in the company. This change reflects the fact that audited accounts for the previous financial year are generally not available for up to six months into the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, if the government had done a little more research when establishing the pooled development funds out of the white paper which was produced back in 1992, a lot of these things might have surfaced, and it might have been structured better in the first place, instead of having to keep coming back to the parliament with amending legislation, as we saw yesterday and as we are seeing today, to try to fix up these things.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not really. However, almost two years after the launch of the now infamous One Nation statement, the Prime Minister, when interviewed on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM </EMPHASIS>program, faced the following question from Maxine McKew:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why not give more assistance to specific industries to help promote value added production?</PARA>

<PARA>He then went on to enunciate other One Nation proposals that have largely been unsuccessful or even less successful than the PDFs to date.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This program is an important element in the government's overall strategy of removing impediments to the growth of Australian industry and improving employment prospects of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is aware that this program will not meet all the needs for channelling capital to small and medium-sized firms.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with him because it has not done that; it has been shown not to have done that. In the debate yesterday the figure that was mentioned was about $35 million. That is all that has flowed into it, and it is going nowhere near helping the people that it was to try and assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to draw a few analogies, as previous speakers have done, on a parochial basis from my electorate. They cut across a couple of comments of government members with regard to the business investment that we are trying to address with pooled development funds. In Wingham&mdash;and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) knows the area fairly well&mdash;we have an employer of in excess of 350 people, the local one of the few remaining high-tech abattoirs in New South Wales that still have an export licence. It was a cooperative that, going back quite a few years, went into liquidation. It was bought by a consortium of local graziers and local business people, kept going not because of the input of the unions involved but because the workers wanted to keep their jobs. They worked three days a week; they had a de facto type of enterprise agreement going for many years there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was privately owned until just recently. The owners had to expand and spend millions of dollars on high-tech gear for the boning room, packaging and freezing to send beef to Japan and Korea, but they could not afford to do it and they could not get the money within Australia. They could not get the finance, although they turned this country upside down to try to find funding to maintain the ownership of that. They did not sell the business, the abattoir, because they wanted to get out of the industry or because they were not making a profit; it was just the enormity of the investment they had to make to maintain their world competitiveness and to maintain their market share overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do you know who owns that now? It is the Nippon Meat Packaging Company, because nobody else would invest in it. There were no Australian investors who were prepared to buy that business, to buy that abattoir. The four owners wanted to maintain their ownership but they could not get the funding to do what they wanted to do so they would not have been in business. So what happened? It is now Japanese owned. The Wingham tannery, a small enterprise, a small business by anybody's standards, employs about 25 people and is striking the exact same problems. The owner cannot get finance because he is moving into an expanding market. He wants to export into South-East Asia. He cannot arrange the capital to buy the stock and to retool. He is not highly geared by any standards as far as his equity is concerned with his loans but he cannot find finance. He is turning the place upside down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been going through the Commonwealth departments and the Commonwealth offices to try to find assistance through the office in Sydney, through the Minister for Small Business</PARA>
<PARA>in New South Wales, because he is struggling to maintain a business. If he cannot get that finance, if he cannot get that capital, he is going to end up closing it down or it might end up being sold to a South-East Asian owner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the problem we are facing. The point that we are trying to make is that we still do not believe, even with the amendments made yesterday and today to the pooled development funds, that it is helping such people. Why is it not helping these people? Why will the commercial financial institutions not underwrite and finance some of these operations? It is because there is more cream elsewhere; there is too much competition in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella was talking about some of the comments that the Leader of the Opposition has made about interest rates, fiscal policy and so on. Right at the nub of that is the competition that the Commonwealth government is placing on the marketplace for finance. The money that you are borrowing is placing too much competition in the marketplace and you are competing with these people. One of the speakers in the House of Representatives talking about the Pooled Development Funds Amendment Bill yesterday told the great example of one of his constituents trying to borrow some money for an expansion in the business. The bank would not lend it but, for the same amount of money, one of his staff borrowed money for a car because there is more profit in it for the banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that there is more room for the Commonwealth government to play in this area to ensure that there is adequate finance on an equitable basis, on a sustainable basis, for small and medium businesses in Australia. If the Commonwealth government does not ensure that there is finance available for expansion, for stock, for promotion and for retooling into the future, we are not going to have a manufacturing base; we are not going to have anything to value add to; we are not going to have those industries here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;More incentive has to be provided. We agree that we are heading in the right direction on the pooled development funds. In the second reading speech, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay) mentioned the changes to the threshold for the investee company&mdash;changes that were made in this bill yesterday, but which had not gone through the House of Representatives then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until we provide more incentive and until we recognise the problems that business faces in this country, we are not going to see those changes. I would like to see some of the companies coming back onshore. We desperately need them. That is the only way that we are going to generate some fair dinkum employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it has been a broad-ranging debate. The honourable member for Corinella mentioned a few important elements for business investment: incentive, certainty, stability, equity of treatment. I think it is a good litmus test. Under this government's policies at the moment, if someone is looking at investing in business in Australia today, can we seriously ask ourselves: is there adequate incentive provided by the government? Is there certainty? Is there stability? Is there equity of treatment for business with other sections of the community? The answer is no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said it yesterday, and I will say it again today: small business in Australia is overtaxed, overregulated, underfinanced and underresourced. Until we address those four key elements of problems in that small business sector, we will not see the projected growth and the projected business investment that the government is talking about and we will not see a major change in the level of unemployment in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Corinella also spoke about foreign investment as a problem that was being alluded to by the Leader of the Opposition. Of course it is a problem. Australian companies want to remain and want to maintain the ownership of their industry and their business in Australian hands, and I have spoken about this in my electorate. Why do we see Australian companies forced into a situation where large multinational corporations have got to buy them? Because they cannot get adequate financing onshore in Australia. It cannot just be the particular circumstances of individual companies where the equity is not right and this is not right and that is not right. We cannot keep talking about those sorts of problems. We must address the issue of the lack of commercial capital onshore in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen a downgrading of the Commonwealth Development Bank as a lender of last resort. I was in the real estate industry for about 15 years. Particularly with rural properties, if someone got knocked back because of particular lending policies of a commercial bank at the time, they could get referred to the Commonwealth Development Bank. Quite often, they could get adequate capital funding from there but it has been narrowed down and almost does not exist. That opportunity for people to invest in business is not there any more, that lender of last resort in this country. That is another area that this government should seriously be looking at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the honourable member for McMillan was talking at length about the APM operation in his electorate. He was talking about the enterprise agreement that had been reached with the unions, which he was obviously closely involved with. He made a very true comment and I agree wholeheartedly with him. He said, `Training is a long-term investment, not a cost.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is exactly right; he is dead right: training is a long term investment. People who are in business&mdash;small, medium and large business&mdash;for the long term recognise that training is a long-term investment; they recognise that their employees are their greatest asset, that their business will not operate without them, that it will not improve itself and that it will not move forward without properly trained employees. He is right in saying that it should not be considered a cost. But the fact is also that it is not incumbent on any government of this country to tell people how much training they should be providing, because those people who are operating profitable businesses, who are operating productive businesses and businesses that are very successful, provide way in excess of the training that this government was trying to impose on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday when we were debating the Training Guarantee (Suspension) Bill, whereby the government was seeking to suspend it for only a couple of years, we moved an amendment to do away with it completely. We keep hearing about the lack of policies of the opposition. That is one part-policy that you have stolen from the opposition. We made it quite clear from the start that we were going to abolish the training guarantee levy. You have suspended it. Ultimately, you will get the message and you will abolish it because you will realise, as you will in a lot of other areas in which this government is operating, that intervention is not necessary. This is an area in which intervention by government is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Run all your training programs through skillshare and through DEET&mdash;that is fine; but business knows the training that it must provide to its employees if it is going to remain competitive, particularly into the future. I am just going to close on that note, because it is a pet subject of mine, but I implore the government, as far as the training guarantee suspension is concerned, to go on all the way and abolish the thing. </PARA>

Its function is to establish and maintain a national system of units and standards of measurement of physical quantities and provide for their uniform use.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, in the four or five seconds since the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) presented the government's response I have not had the opportunity to read that response. However, like the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), I was honoured to be part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which received the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill for consideration. Indeed, it is part of history, because this is the first time that a House of Representatives committee has deliberated on a government bill and made certain recommendations. I must say that I think it is a credit to the minister and to the government that a very large number of those recommendations brought forward by our committee have been picked up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my period of membership in the parliament I have often criticised the way that the parliament has been used as a sausage machine. The precedent set by the minister at the table is a precedent which I would like to see followed more often, because an ounce of prevention is much better than a ton of cure. If bills could be referred to bipartisan committees which are able to consider those references and bring forward recommendations, then we will find quite often that the law enacted by the parliament will be of a higher standard, will have fewer mistakes and will require less remedial action than would otherwise be the case and than has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill arose out of a growing concern in Western nations and throughout the world over the sexual abuse and exploitation of children in the child prostitution industry mainly in South-East Asian countries. Included amongst those countries are Thailand, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. However, it should be noted that this bill does refer to activities throughout the world and the actions which this bill criminalises will be actions throughout the world, not simply in the area of South-East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The child prostitution industry, unfortunately and sadly&mdash;and I believe tragically&mdash;has been supported to a significant extent by tourists, including tourists from Australia. The introduction of this bill was preceded by an increasing awareness that Australia's international reputation was being undermined by the activities of a very small number of people and that as a civilised nation we had to do something to stop our residents and our citizens from participating in this pernicious trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is widely known that in many Asian countries there is a very much lower likelihood of being apprehended for activities relating to the sexual abuse of children than would be the case in this country or in other Western countries, and the penalties for sexual abuse are generally less severe than those which would apply in Australia. Often we found that tourists went abroad from Australia and participated in evil activities without any real risk of being apprehended and without any real risk of being penalised. Some Asian countries, to their credit, have now begun to crack down on child prostitution and the involvement of Australian and overseas nationals in sexual abuse and exploitation of young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this bill is necessary, although I am one of those who have a concern about Australian parliaments enacting laws to control the activities of Australians overseas generally. I believe that first and foremost&mdash;as recognised in this bill&mdash;the laws of the country where the activities take place should take priority and should have pre-eminence. I suppose this bill is designed as a safety net measure, in effect to criminalise activities and to prosecute in Australia Australian citizens and residents, who would otherwise escape the laws of those overseas nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say, though, that I think the nature of the activities sought to be caught by this bill is so abhorrent that it is justifiable, and indeed appropriate, for this parliament to be enacting this legislation. I have major concerns, also, about this parliament tearing up the constitution of Australia by, in effect, signing conventions and treaties which then give the federal parliament legislative competence in areas which under our constitution would normally be matters for the states. I was heartened, however, by advice from the Attorney-General's Department that this legislation is not based on a treaty or a convention but rather on the external affairs power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing that a large number of the amendments suggested by our committee have been picked up by the government. At the heart of those amendments is the suggestion that the justice which applies to accused in this country should apply also when offences are committed overseas. What we did not want to do was to set up a kangaroo court where accused people were not given all of the protections and safeguards that under the British-Australian criminal system are normally extended to people who are accused of crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 to insert a new part IIIA dealing with, firstly, sexual offences committed by Australian residents overseas; secondly, related offences of benefiting from or encouraging the above mentioned offences; thirdly, defences to these offences; fourthly, the provision of evidence by video link in proceedings under this part; and, fifthly, the provision of rules relating to the conduct of trials under this part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once enacted, this bill will, in summary, create a range of sexual offences involving children, committed by Australian citizens as residents overseas, and create offences relating to the organisation or promotion of child sex tourism. It is very important to make sure that the promoters of this kind of activity are also caught, and the government has accepted this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition raised numerous concerns about this bill in the first instance. Among them was the title of the bill. It was suggested by my colleague, the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), that the bill should more properly be entitled the Crime (Overseas Exploitation of Children) Bill. I am sorry that the minister has not picked up that suggestion by the honourable member for Tangney; I think that name is a more appropriate name for the bill. The bill's title at the moment tends to be emotive, but I suppose that is a matter not of substance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had further concerns, relating to the inherent vagueness of the original bill. Also, we had concerns that the penalties for those who organise and encourage offences were less than the penalties for those who commit the offences. We were worried about poor drafting&mdash;for example, in defining the offence, in referring to the `offender' rather than to a `person'. The explanatory memorandum for the bill indicated that sexual offences against children overseas did not apply in situations where a child was only incidentally present during sexual activity because of, for example, cramped living conditions. However, this was not indicated in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the deeming of proof in relation to proof of age was identified as being fraught with danger, as an Australian jury would have much difficulty in determining the age of a victim. There were suggestions that, if the jury was not satisfied that the victim was, for example, under 12 years of age, they should convict of the under-16 offence; and, if not convinced the victim was under 16, they should acquit. However, it was noticed that the Victorian Crimes Act provides that the judge or jury may determine a person's age on evidence and this may involve the appearance of the person. One could argue that the capacity of an Australian jury to estimate the age of an alleged victim of Asian extraction, by video, is somewhat restricted. We had excellent evidence from Professor Bode at the committee hearings. He was a person who said that, while he could determine the degree of physical maturity of a particular child, he was not necessarily able to determine a child's chronological age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the principle of this legislation has widespread support from the coalition and indeed from throughout the community. However, inherent difficulties were evident from the beginning. Those difficulties were picked up in our committee's report. The government has brought down its response to the report and we therefore see the amendments which are now before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During public hearings on the bill&mdash;and I was privileged to attend some of those&mdash;many major issues of concern were raised. I must say I was impressed with the quality of the witnesses who came before the committee. They were people without vested interests. I must say that a number of them had differing views but you would expect that on an issue such as this you would get differing views from different people who approach a subject from varying perspectives. I must say that I was impressed with the quality of the contributions, the honesty of the contributions and the way in which the people came before us without vested interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that particularly alerted me to the problems in the bill were concerns relating to fundamental legal principles and, indeed, the need to ensure that the system of prosecutions proposed in fact, provide justice for those people who are accused. The issues raised were considered under four broad headings. Firstly, there were social issues. The majority of Australians are outraged by the sexual abuse of children be they Australian or foreign children. Such conduct is an offence against Australian community standards and it is a criminal offence when committed in Australia. The committee supported the view that such conduct ought to be criminalised when committed by Australians overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, however, recognised serious problems in the drafting of the bill. For example, the bill's response to procuring evidence and prosecuting a case was to short-circuit some of the traditional safeguards afforded to accused persons in Australia. These concerns were picked up by the acting Senior Public Defender for New South Wales, Mr Martin Sides QC, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child sex tourism exploits children and it exploits poverty, and it is desirable that this country should play a part in bringing it to an end. Any legislation should be workable and it should be practical. It is no use passing legislation that is unworkable. In the rush to end this most hideous trade, we must not lose sight of the fundamental principles that underpin our democratic institutions; one of those is the right of the accused to a fair trial. . . The right of the accused to receive a fair trial is paramount. If that right is undermined we compromise our democratic institutions. . . It is my view that there are significant and powerful procedures that are not available to accused persons or, for that matter, the prosecution in this legislative scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee recommended that the bill uphold the legal protection afforded to accused persons. That is at the heart of our criminal justice system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of foreign policy the committee noted that the conduct of Australians overseas impacts on our bilateral and multilateral relations. There are also significant practical difficulties arising from the bill such as the cost of prosecuting a court case, costs of defending a case, cost of a video link, collecting evidence of the proscribed conduct, the reliability of documentary evidence on the age of a child and protection for witnesses, just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say I am interested to see the minister present in the committee because I gather that he said earlier in the House that the legislation would not create any additional expense or any additional Commonwealth outlays and that the costs of prosecutions could be found from the budgets of the federal police and from other Commonwealth bodies. Well, the evidence that we had at committee hearings was that if this bill is going to be successful there will have to be a very substantial injection of funds to ensure that the federal police and the authorities and, indeed, the court systems have the capacity to process and deal with matters covered by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to legal concerns raised by the bill, the principles of justice were the most important issue of concern raised by witnesses during public hearings and in submissions. Some witnesses believe that the presumption of innocence on the basis of the Australian tradition of criminal law was put at risk by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further concern was the lack of consultation in preparing the legislation. The committee recommended that the government ensure adequate and effective consultation in the preparation of legislation. Such consultation should extend to practitioners experienced on both prosecution and defence matters, as well as to lawyers' organisations such as the bar associations and the law council and to non-legal organisations such as civil liberties groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, after extensive discussion and consultation the committee made 37 recommendations impacting on the legislation. In the conclusion to its report, the committee supported the objectives of the bill. It accepted that in the past Australians travelling to overseas destinations have been able to abuse children sexually and to escape the consequences of their behaviour on their return to Australia. The same activity would be criminal if perpetrated in Australia. The committee made particular note of the need to redraft certain clauses to overcome oversights and errors in the bill. The report reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the beginning of the Committee's consideration of the Bill, concerns were expressed about provisions in the Bill which in the view of some witnesses contain unacceptable changes to criminal law principles and procedures. These include apparent short-cuts to assist the prosecution because of the practical difficulties of conducting a successful prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the committee reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee believes certain Clauses can be successfully redrafted to ensure that the Bill is effective and enforceable without abandoning the safeguards that have been traditional elements of the criminal law in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Among the major amendments recommended by the committee were collapsing into one category the existing categories of offences, under-12 and under-16, to stop defendants being acquitted because the child's age was unable to be determined, with the maximum penalty for having sex with a child set at 17 years, and the government has picked this up. Another was increasing the maximum penalty for those found guilty of organising sex tours from 10 to 17 years, and again the government has agreed to this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended removing a clause making it mandatory for courts to take evidence by video link where the witness's attendance would cause unreasonable expense or cause the witness psychological damage, giving discretion to the court. The government again has adopted this suggestion. I must say this was one the matters that concerned members of the committee. It is in order to have video link evidence if it reduces costs and enables the matter to be dealt with expeditiously, but one has to have very effective safeguards with video link evidence to make sure that there is a possibility to cross-examine, that one can look at the demeanour of a witness, and that justice is not only done but also seen to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended that an alteration be made to a clause under which people convicted or acquitted of child sex offences overseas cannot be tried in Australia, to ensure that there is no loophole to escape Australian justice; and also that the states bring their laws against paedophiles into line. The final recommendation of the committee reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Parliament pass the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 as soon as the serious problems raised in this report are considered and addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>The problems raised in the report were serious, but I must say the response is to the minister's credit and to the government's credit. You do not often find me coming into the parliament to give the government a lot of credit, but I believe that, where credit is due, it should be given; and I believe the minister has seriously taken on board the recommendations of our committee. He might not have implemented all of those recommendations, which is unfortunate, but we cannot expect to win in every case. I think the bill that we are now debating today in the committee is infinitely better than the bill that was debated in the main chamber earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a bipartisan report presented. The minister considered seriously the recommendations of that bipartisan report. The legislation that will result from this debate and the debate in the other place will be very much better legislation. It will assist to maintain Australia's reputation internationally, and it will make sure that this pernicious activity by a very small number of Australians overseas will be criminalised and that people who commit offences will receive the justice they deserve; but also it will make sure that accused people are indeed given the proper protections that one would expect in any fair and reasonable justice system. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered evidence from many people, both from a legal standpoint and from a practical standpoint. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not terribly familiar with all of the intricacies of law. Those sorts of things are way above my head, but we do have many people, such as the Minister for Justice, and members of the committee, who have studied law and know the ins and outs of it in fine detail. They are a credit to this place, of course, and to their profession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me, as a relatively simple fellow, are the practical difficulties, as I think they have been described in the report, regarding the implementation of this law. There have been calls for this law to be a model. I put it to this chamber and to the minister that a law is only as good as its enforcement. This law should not just be a model law but a model for action. They are two very different things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are going through the development of a law of this country which will apply outside Australia. That in itself is something novel and very important, particularly in respect of this issue. In many regards, we are going into somewhat uncharted territories.

That is one of the reasons why millions of children across the world are still in slavery, especially sexual slavery. While this country, and most other countries, outlawed slavery many years ago it still persists. Slavery through sexual exploitation is a very big problem in the countries of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems arise because of the poverty that so many people, particularly in rural areas, find themselves in. Despite the best efforts of their own governments and many other agencies, there still exists poverty, and the need for parents to sell their children into slavery&mdash;a slavery that most Australians and most people in the world, particularly through the agency of the United Nations, would describe as despicable and abhorrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that we have a law so that, if ever a case is brought to prosecution in this country, we have to very much consider the protection of any witnesses, particularly in a case where the witness is likely to have been a victim of sexual abuse and exploitation as well as slavery. It is on that issue that we, as a government, have to focus our responsibility, and the people of Australia have to focus on their responsibility through government action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a law, which I think is workable. First of all, it signals to those in the industry who develop the tourism and the sex slavery trade outside Australia that they are being put on notice, that they cannot escape the examination and opprobrium of this country by operating their trade in another country. We are putting on notice those who use those entrepreneurs, shall we say&mdash;although they are slavers&mdash;to get their satisfaction from children in another country in this way. Those Australians are clearly under the spotlight now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that, in many countries, we do not see the same attention being paid in a practical day-to-day manner to enforce existing laws in these countries to protect people. Particularly now that we have this legislation, Australia should take this up in a bilateral manner and should seek the open and total cooperation of governments and law enforcement agencies in those countries to overcome this. There are ways in which the Australian government&mdash;through the agency and the department of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, as well as other ministers&mdash;could do much to improve that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we generally trust the law enforcement procedures and the police forces in Australia&mdash;most Australians have a genuine regard for our justice system&mdash;part of the problem is that that is not always the case in these countries that we are talking about. Whether it be the police, the military or other forms of authority in those countries, we often find that those agencies are just as involved in protecting this industry as are others who would be acting without any authority or protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me clearly to the point that, if we are expecting a person to come before a case to be prosecuted and to give evidence in Australia, that person needs a particular form of protection, something which we, in Australia, would take for granted. When the first case is brought before the courts under this legislation, I will have great concern for the safety and the protection of any person acting as a witness for the prosecution. We do not need to see these sorts of things on TV to recognise what is quite likely to occur&mdash;namely, that the witness or those witnesses will probably disappear and be found dead somewhere at some time in the future. That is, if anyone cares what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witnesses to the inquiry of the committee gave evidence that Catholic priests in some cases have to carry guns to protect themselves&mdash;that is, when they are involved in organisations which are setting out to give alternative support and safe haven to children in these countries who are subject to sex slavery in this way. Therefore, it should be apparent that, if Catholic priests are forced to carry guns for self-protection when protecting children from life on the street or in this trade, then any witness outside Australia who is going to be brought before a court operating in Australia is going to need very secure protection, if we are to ensure that this law does as intended, which is to stop exploitation of children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst thing, and something that I do not think anyone would want, is that any witness&mdash;most probably a victim, as well&mdash;should be found to be harmed in any way by virtue of being a witness. The government has to very seriously address this matter. We cannot just rely upon the law itself; we must have, on the ground, systems for the protection of witnesses&mdash;something that is very difficult for us in Australia to manage. We do not have the authorities; we do not have the way of dealing with day-to-day life that the police and military in those countries have. I believe that the government has to pay very serious attention to this issue, which is described simply in the report under the heading of `Practical difficulties'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not attend to this matter, then the law will not be a model law and it will not achieve what it is meant to achieve and what everyone wants it to achieve. It could, I believe, end up as a death sentence. I am not being melodramatic about this. I believe that, if effective protective mechanisms are not put into place for witnesses and organisations that support witnesses, then we could be writing a death sentence for someone in that situation; and nobody wants that. So the law has to be a model for action. That means that the Minister for Justice and the minister responsible for overseas development issues and others have to focus their minds on supporting agencies and supporting witnesses who would come before the courts in any of these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the conduct of the inquiry, I and most other members of the committee and the rest of the parliament would have received a lot of letters during a somewhat emotional and, at times, hysterical campaign from some well-intentioned people in the community who felt that the work of the committee was a delaying tactic by some in the parliament, or that it would water down the bill and make it less effective. Judging from my involvement in the consideration of the committee's work, and judging from the response of the minister and the government, it is very clear that the legislation has been significantly improved and that, through that process, a very clear and unusually strong bipartisan approach has been developed from this parliament&mdash;an occurrence which is obviously to the credit of the parliament and to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise that point because I think it is important that, with issues that at times are obviously emotive and that people have very strong feelings about, there needs to be a better understanding in the community of the processes of deliberation of legislation. I am glad to see that most of those people and organisations who wrote to us in such alarm, urging us to ignore these matters or to come very quickly to conclusions similar to the original legislation, have now responded with much happiness at the outcomes. That is something which is obviously welcome, and it is also indicative of the value of the process that we have gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to my main concern in this whole issue. I know that there are many recommendations and considerations that the committee has taken notice of&mdash;as indeed there were in the minds of the minister and the department in putting this legislation before us in the first place. Many of those are very difficult, technical, legal ground-breaking considerations. I end on the point that, if we do not look beyond the actual law to the process of application of the law,  and particularly to the protection of witnesses and other people that this law has been put in place to protect, then we will not only do an incredible disservice to the law, but also to those very people it should protect&mdash;and possibly at the risk of life. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Hollis)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;It is the first occasion I have sat here, too. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I commend you and wish you well. I trust that you will have many other occasions when you shall be able to enjoy that or other functions around this parliament. It is interesting that this system seems to allow an intimacy that does not exist elsewhere, but in speaking here there are a couple of things I would say. Firstly, I am delighted that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) is here. If it is to work, it really has to involve an exchange with the minister. I know it can be a bit of a bore and there is another world out there, but if we are going to have the system actually functioning it is important that there is this opportunity of interchange. Therefore, I commend the Minister for Justice for being here, and if we can have that sort of an opportunity for dialogue then it will work a lot better than otherwise. Generally, I think that the system is worth a go. How it works out, no doubt time itself will tell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, as others no doubt have said, this is the first time in my recollection that legislation has been sent off to a committee of the House for consideration. I think that is something that can be looked at to a greater degree, and the product proves, in this instance, that it has worked. My reservation is only that the reason it has to be sent off is that we are not allowing enough debate on legislation in the parliament itself, and I think that is a pity. While I am all in favour of a Main Committee and allowing references to committees of the parliament, I remain a champion of the parliament and I very much regret that it is necessary for us to have these sorts of occasions because the parliament fails. In a way we are not identifying ways by which we can make the parliament per se more effective. It is there and in that function I continue to have concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the legislation before us, there are a few background aspects to this consideration. The first is that I commend the minister for having accepted so many of the recommendations, in spite of his earlier reservations. The trouble is that there are not many areas in the past where we have tried to legislate for offences outside jurisdiction. It is important that in so doing we do not forget that the states do have a concern. I do commend to the minister the consultative processes which we have recommended in the committee's report because it is important that we still retain a cognisance of the extent to which, in the judicial system in Australia, the state systems are so important, particularly in the criminal law field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worries me that, in developing fields like this to apply outside jurisdiction, we retain a very close connection with the administration of justice within the states and the territories of our federation. I do not see that it need be against the principles that are applied, or are sought to be applied, federally but rather a way by which they can more effectively be applied. It is particularly important for the minister in this and other areas that, to the maximum degree, there be both consultation and acceptance of propositions and proposals put by the state ministers because, while they too can be a little trying at times, they are part of the federal system and it is the way by which our system has to function. Therefore, for all the difficulties that it entails, I think it is essential that there be consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the actual implementation of the changes and the amendments which I am pleased to see the minister has advanced, there are a couple of aspects that I want to address. The first is that in the area of applying an offence outside jurisdiction there are two aspects that demonstrably require attention&mdash;and I see that they have had fairly significant attention in the amendments. The first is the extent to which proper protection needs to be given to the accused. While all of us deplore the trade and all of us seek to prevent the trade, it is important that people accused be still given the proper protection of the Australian judicial system so that a person against whom an accusation is made remains innocent until the charge is proved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a particularly emotive area. It is deplorable that it should exist at all. It does exist and the people need to be brought to justice but, because it is outside jurisdiction and others have different concepts of justice, it becomes more difficult sometimes to ensure that the accused person is seen as just that until the case is proven. I worry, in the application of offences outside jurisdiction, that that proper protection is allowed. That in no way means that the people should not be prosecuted. It in no way means that they should not be tried in the same way as any other offender, but it does mean that the same protections against the accused person should be maintained, not to give them undue protection but to ensure they get the proper protection of our Australian judicial system. That is even more important because I worry that in another reference before the committee whose report is here we are looking at another instance where offences occurring outside jurisdiction are to be tried. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It becomes extraordinarily difficult if you are in a position where other concepts of law intrude on our Australian judicial system and where we are to a degree derogating the concepts of Australian citizenship, Australian residency and the protections of our Australian legal system. So it is particularly important that we get the right balance. The first real aspect as far as the amendments are concerned is that they do enhance that and I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is the video link taking of evidence. For a long while, through my wife and through other contacts, I have been aware that here in the ACT for some years the Chief Magistrate has pioneered and advanced the concept of video evidence of witnesses with respect to child abuse cases, and I do commend Magistrate Ron Cahill for that. He has done an excellent job in the pioneering of this form of taking evidence but it needs to be done in such a way that the evidence is taken as though it were before the court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian instance it is done because so often the high emotion around the abuse of a child makes it hard for that child to give evidence in a dispassionate way. If they were in a more comfortable forum with people surrounding them whom they know it would be easier for them than being in the forum of a court. It concerns me, when we apply video link evidence in this field where you are taking evidence from someone overseas, that you do again take that witness into a surround where you can properly expect the evidence to be given to be true, and where, whether it is through an oath or an affirmation or some obligation imposed on the witness, you can get reasonable results because in video link for overseas witnesses it becomes even more difficult to ensure that you are actually going to get the person who is giving evidence in a climate where they understand the processes of our judicial system. If a person is falsely accused and falsely convicted, then it brings the whole of the system into disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the protection that the minister has inserted&mdash;the video link&mdash;will work, but it is an area that we will need to give some attention to and perhaps as time passes we will need to see how it works. I commend the minister for developing it. I know he is committed to it and I think it will work. The one thing that we referred to in 5.4.2 on page 49 of our report, which concerns me still, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration may need to be given as to whether child witnesses understand the nature and quality of any oath or affirmation that they give.</PARA>
<PARA>That is so true. It is particularly important that we look at the competency of witnesses and the extent to which those witnesses are affecting the guilt or innocence of the accused. It is a difficult area but it is one that has been improved by the amendments the minister has made. I therefore support them. I suspect that they are not matters which should be seen as having been written in Holy Writ, but that they are matters that need to be considered as time progresses and we see how the charges move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, I was not here when the minister introduced the amendments and I have been trying to ascertain the extent to which the age question has been resolved. It is now resolved satisfactorily but I must say that it had worried me that the age of the person against whom the offence was charged was going to be a major issue of contention. I think that is now satisfactorily covered. It is important that we understand that many people do not look their age&mdash;some look older than they are. If it then becomes a reasonable excuse that the person, against whom the offence is said to have been committed, appeared and was genuinely believed to be of a legal age, then, of course, it removes the capacity for the prosecution to be successful. Therefore, it is important that age be dealt with in a reasonable way. As I read the amendments, I think that is now satisfactorily covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I was interested in, and which has worried me, is that the people who conduct the sex tours and trade also need to be dealt with. Under the amended legislation, 50DA(1) and 50DB(1) certainly seem to me to satisfy the criteria. This is an offence which seems to me to be part of the trouble. Tourist agents and operators, and so on, have seen it as another way to expand the attractions, or whatever they call them, for people taking particular journeys. That should also be treated as an offence against the whole purpose. It is a barbaric trade, it needs to be prevented and I think this legislation, as now amended, should go a significant way to achieving that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the legislation has been significantly improved. I commend the minister on accepting the proposals from this committee and trust that, in consultation with his state and territory colleagues, the legislation will stop a trade which all of us accept is wrong. It should not exist in the first place and it certainly needs to be prevented. I commend the minister and the amendments that he has made to the legislation and support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To gather some concept of the horrific nature of the trade in child abuse and the activities of paedophiles from around the world in South-East Asia, one has only to read the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Child and the Tourist</EMPHASIS> by Ron O'Grady, published for the End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, Australia Group. Whilst I am in no position to judge the veracity of what Ron O'Grady has written, if there is enough truth in that to warrant the publication, and enough truth in the publication to warrant the legislative approach that the government has taken, I think that all honourable members will support it, as will all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has been a first for the House of Representatives and an opportunity to examine legislation in detail. It is regrettable that, over the last two years, the government has chosen to adopt a rather slack approach to legislation, often introducing bills and important measures with little notice and, in other instances, forcing under guillotine the most extensive and pervasive measures through the House, without adequate scrutiny by the House. That is not the case with this legislation, and the difficult nature of it and the complexity and the sensitivity of some of the measures proposed, which are unique in Australian law, have caused the government to consider the House of Representatives Committee for Legal and Constitutional Affairs a proper place for close scrutiny and examination of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pay tribute to my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), whom I believe, of all honourable members, was most responsible for alerting the House of the need to use its own committees. On a previous occasion, he was unsuccessful in persuading the House or the minister but, on this occasion, he initiated the interest and the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), who is at the table, complied, and we thank the minister for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps, as an aside to the minister, I might make the request that we be given a little more time in future. I am sure that we could, without setting hurdles or difficulties in the path of the government, do a more adequate job under less pressure and with less pressure on our staff. I think that everybody would work along a little more happily if we had perhaps a more considerate time frame. I trust that the minister, in his response, indicates that he is happy with the process that we have gone through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with a number of matters in the legislation, but in particular I wish to deal with a matter where I had a difference of opinion with my colleagues. That was contained in an expression of concern included in the report, where I stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, I find that the proposition contained in Recommendation 18(b) may allow otherwise sound prosecutions to fail. The obnoxious character of this trade leads me to conclude that defence based on belief about age must be proved on the balance of probabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that in this instance the onus of proof should be reversed, and I am pleased to see the government has sided with my view rather than with the committee view. I commend the government for that because, whilst the proposal that the onus of proof be reversed is not lightly entered into, I think we must be satisfied that Australians&mdash;citizens and residents&mdash;should not play any part in abuse and sexual exploitation of children under the age of 16 in the conditions that apply in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a different matter to apply the proper processes for occurrences in a nation where arrests and proper processes of court can take place. We are not talking about that. We are talking about acts committed outside Australia. So despite the unusual nature of this process, I want to commend the government for deciding to weigh the defence lightly with an extra difficulty, and that is that the defence must prove on the balance of probabilities that the belief on age was well founded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the other areas that the legislation covers, I wish to deal with the video link evidence. That is a matter that concerned me, having looked very closely at the war crimes legislation and the difficulties that the Americans and Israelis had entered into with video link evidence. I can only caution the minister there. I have seen photographs of people under close surveillance being intimidated in their evidence on video, with the person doing the intimidating off camera. With a second camera in the room it is possible to see who is in the room and what influence they are bringing to bear on a witness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the video link process needs a lot of investigation. I would be very reluctant to enter into this in any light manner. I believe it is a matter that the minister needs to follow carefully and that the House may need to review. If there is any miscarriage of justice, if there is any perjury, or if there is any false evidence given, what is the recourse the minister proposes? There is very little that can be done to rectify false statements or perjury when video evidence is taken. That is a matter that was of concern to me and to all members of the committee, and that is why we were reluctant to proceed as quickly as the government wanted to proceed in the taking of video evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in the government's reply it was said that the government does not accept that its previous formulation violated traditional standards of justice. That is an extraordinary statement. It is not couched in thoughtful terms, because it does deny protection for people giving evidence that would be completely unacceptable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to consultation with the states, I would encourage the minister to proceed strongly but to carry the states with him, if at all possible, because this must be a total package if we are going to prevent tours. Tourist operators, tourist agencies and people putting together tours must, under state law, be controlled. I do not want to see, and I do not think anybody in the committee wants to see, an extraordinary extension of Commonwealth powers in this area. We would want the states to pick up their proper responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response places much of the responsibility for consultation on the states, saying that state governments have an interest in a bill such as this and that it is up to their Attorneys-General to consult widely. That does not absolve the Commonwealth from consulting. The committee found, when it consulted, a wealth of opinion and some interesting views that encouraged us to come down with a report which has been basically adopted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little else that I want to comment on, except the consent requirement. We, as a committee, cannot understand the government's difficulty in accepting the requirement that consent should not be an element in defence. The government, in its response to the committee's report, spends some time and some effort in explaining why consent should be part of the process, but ultimately decides in favour of the committee's recommendation. It is the view of the committee that by allowing consent to be part of the process we just blow the thing sky high and make the legislation very difficult to administer. It is difficult legislation in any way, and in any manner, because the issue is how we can apply Australian law in an external capacity such as is being proposed in this legislation. It is by threat, it is by example, it is by word of mouth and it is by a cultural attitude that we hope to modify behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the committee agrees with the government that everything must be done, this legislation does have limitations. I wish the government well with the legislation. I congratulate my colleague the honourable member for Tangney with the encouragement that the chamber adopt this process. I express appreciation to the minister for his willingness for the government to adopt most of the recommendations of the committee, and point out that there needs to be ongoing attention paid to the taking of evidence by video link. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most commendable, in my view, that the members of this house have cooperated so energetically to ensure that the best possible bill has been prepared. I earnestly hope that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has a proper appreciation of the extensive work that has been done by the members of the committee, by some of the witnesses before the committee and&mdash;I mention in particular&mdash;by the secretariat of the committee that prepared the report. The committee, of course, is the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of this house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commented previously on the tabling of the committee's report and I do not propose to repeat what I said then. Since then, the minister has tabled the government's response to the committee, which largely accepts the recommendations in the committee's report. Despite what I would regard as some inappropriately reluctant acceptances of some recommendations, I think the government's response is generally appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the recommendations of the committee to amend the original bill have not been taken up by the government, reasons have been given; and I think it is fair to say that the decisions were taken in good faith and that none of the disagreement between the committee and the government in its response is so serious or significant as to justify any further opposition, from this side at least, of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one recommendation of the committee I do comment on. It is, on the face of it, accepted; it is recommendation 4. In this the committee recommended that the government ensure adequate and effective consultation in the preparation of legislation and suggested that such consultation should extend to practitioners experienced in both prosecution and defence as well as to lawyers' organisations such as the bar associations and the law council and to non-legal organisations such as civil liberties groups. The government said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is prepared to look at the issue of wider consultation in the preparation of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>That appears to me to be somewhat lukewarm. The government goes on to note that the bill arose out of an initiative of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and gives a history of the development of the bill, which involved consultation with state and territory attorneys-general. It said in the response then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As pointed out to the committee and also noted in its report, normally whenever there is federal legislation in which state governments have an interest, such as the bill, state attorneys-general would seek views within their jurisdiction, including the views of defence practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to be stating that the Commonwealth itself had no consultations with persons practising on a day-to-day basis in the criminal courts. That seems to me to be a serious deficiency in the procedures for the development of legislation of this type, and I would urge the minister to ensure that the department develops consultation processes that do involve people involved on a day-to-day basis in the practice of the relevant area of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other speakers this morning, in particular the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), have referred to the importance of the enforcement of the bill. It is novel in a number of ways. First, and perhaps most notable, is the use of international video links for the taking of evidence in courts in criminal trials. Secondly, perhaps notably, it creates offences where the conduct is constituted by conduct abroad that in some cases is not necessarily an offence in the place where the conduct takes place. As other speakers have urged, I add my weight to the suggestion that the legislation be carefully monitored. Its effectiveness will be carefully assessed by interest groups, who will be very quick to criticise the government if it is not effective. In that respect, it would be useful to all if there were information obtained to give some guide or yardstick by which to judge the effectiveness of the legislation. I appreciate it is difficult to obtain that sort of information but, for example, statistics on the advertising and conduct of what appear to be sex tours from Australia would be one area where a possible guideline could be identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I suggest to the committee that the process by which this bill has reached this stage should be seen as an appropriate model for the processing, in appropriate cases, of difficult legislation. I trust the government will recognise the benefits, as I am sure the minister does, of the use of standing committees as a means of maximising public consultation and input on complex issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I hand up three copies of the explanatory memorandum. It has been useful to have the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Constitutional Affairs look at the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill from a fresh perspective. The government is unable to accept the committee's general criticism that the bill as introduced departed unreasonably from traditional safeguards or throws aside 200 years of criminal justice with fairness for the accused. These extreme statements appear to be largely based on a misunderstanding of the law in Australia as it relates to sexual offences against children and the available defences. Under the law of sexual offences involving children across the Australian jurisdictions, it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence, but a defence is allowed as to the accused's belief&mdash;reasonable belief in some jurisdictions&mdash;which is a matter for the accused to establish on the balance of probabilities. That is the case in every Australian jurisdiction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill follows this approach, and I hold to my view that the general structure of offences and defences in the bill is appropriate. The government, therefore, does not adopt the committee's recommendation concerning the burden of proof as the defendant's belief about the age of a child. The proposed section is in accordance with judicial authority and equivalent legislation&mdash;for example, R v. Douglas 1985 Victorian Reports, and Heath, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Indictable Offences in Victoria</EMPHASIS>, and the authorities cited therein. As both the former and current presidents of the Australian Law Reform Commission pointed out to the committee, it is within normal standards to require the defence to establish belief in age on the balance of probabilities&mdash;a point also made by the law faculty of the University of New South Wales and by the Attorney-General of South Australia in their submissions to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, unlike its counterparts under state legislation, proposed 50CA currently only requires a subjective belief to be proven on the balance of probabilities. It would be extremely difficult for the prosecution to negate beyond reasonable doubt an assertion of what was in the mind of the accused at the time of the alleged offence, especially when that which may be asserted need not be reasonable or rational, and when intoxication can be used to assist the defence of mistaken belief. As Justice Elizabeth Evatt noted, knowledge of age&mdash;a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused&mdash;is not an element of the offences which must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills also had no difficulty with the proposed section, nor was the government persuaded by the committee's recommendation that no prosecution should proceed in Australia if the actions are not criminal in the laws of the foreign country. I believe that to accept that recommendation would defeat the purposes of the bill. The policies behind the bill require an attack on the demand aspect of the problem at its source, notwithstanding the legality or otherwise of the proscribed conduct in some countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A defence of legality would merely encourage paedophiles to avoid the bill by targeting those countries whose laws against child sexual abuse may be inadequate or who lack the resources to combat it. Moreover, the Convention on the Rights of the Child represents an internationally agreed standard for the treatment of children and places an onus on signatories to encourage other states to review their relevant laws in the light of that standard. In any event, reforms have and are being undertaken by those countries in which the exploitation of children occurs in order to bring their laws into line with international standards. For example, Thailand is expected to introduce legislation which will, among other things, expressly make it an offence to have sex with a child prostitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a matter that also concerns the government, in legislation that is already quite complex, is the added&mdash;in my view, as a matter of principle, unjustifiable&mdash;complexity created by such a defence. The availability of a defence that a proscribed act is not criminal in the laws of the foreign country will invariably lead to the need to call expert evidence and to a contest as to what the requirements of foreign law are. As well as the substantive law, that would include proof of the content of the background, such as questions of mens rea, in legal systems that may be different from our own. The committee has stressed the need to avoid any potential confusion to juries and to simplify the issues in any trial under the legislation. To introduce such a defence would clearly run counter to that principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of the committee's recommendations which the government has adopted concerned general procedure for legislative policy development or minor drafting changes of a technical nature which are explained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum. The more significant changes to the bill as introduced are as follows. Firstly, proposed section 50FA, on the determination of a child's age, has been redrafted as agreed during the committee's hearings. The provision sets out the matters which the jury may take into account in judging a child's age in the absence of birth records. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These include, but are not limited to, the appearance of the child, medical or other scientific opinions, and foreign documents or records, or copies of them. The proposed section 50FA preserves all the normal rules as to admissibility of evidence, and includes a clarifying statement that the prosecution is not relieved of its obligation to obtain the best possible evidence of age. Indeed, the prosecution has no interest in providing anything less than the best available evidence of age to the jury since age, like all other elements of the offences, must be proved to the jury beyond reasonable doubt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, regarding the inclusion of a warning to the jury that, if evidence is treated as admissible because of subsection 50FA(1), the jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in determining the age or age range of the child. Thirdly, I refer to the inclusion of a definition of `act of indecency' in proposed section 50ABA. Although any definition of the expression `act of indecency' must necessarily be in very wide terms, the government has come to the view that even such a wide definition is useful in these circumstances in order to overcome perceived difficulties with code jurisdictions in applying the common law and to ensure uniformity of the relevant considerations regardless of where in Australia a trial takes place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that the definition proposed represents an appropriate codification of the common law for the purposes of the bill. An act of indecency is defined as an act of a sexual nature, involving the human body, or bodily actions or functions, and so unbecoming or offensive that it amounts to a gross breach of ordinary contemporary standards of decency and propriety in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the collapsing of the standard and aggravated sexual offences into a single offence against children under 16 years involves the amendment of the age of the child proposed in sections 50BA, 50BC, 50BE and 50BG to read `a person who is under 16' and the deletion of proposed sections 50BB, 50BD, 50BF and 50BH. The government agrees that a potential gap in the legislation could have arisen because of the probability that birth records in many countries where child sexual exploitation occurs may be inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee is aware, the same problem arises in relation to sexual offences under state legislation, upon which the bill's provisions are partly based, but it is insignificant because of Australia's universal birth records which establish age precisely. As recommended, the minimum penalties are retained for the merged offences, and proposed section 50FE has been inserted providing that in sentencing a person convicted of an offence under the part, the court must take the age and maturity of the complainant into account. These considerations are additional to the matters which must be taken into account under section 16A(2) of the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth significant point is the inclusion of `intends to derive gratification' as an element of proposed offences involving acts of indecency permitted in the presence of a child, and the sixth a removal of the belief as to consent as to an element of the defences in clauses 50CA and 50CB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With reluctance, and after much consideration, the government has agreed to remove the element of consent as an element of defences in clauses 50CA and 50CB. That requirement was included out of a concern to protect persons under the age of 16 from conduct by Australians where the perpetrator either does not believe the person is under the age of 16 or does not believe the person consents to the conduct. The absence of a consenting requirement could allow an individual to escape liability merely because he or she believed the person was over 16, irrespective of the fact that the evidence disclosed that the child had been raped or had been forced to commit indecent acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a novel requirement. Consent is a requirement of the `reasonable mistake' defence available in respect of similar offences under state laws where the elements of the defence are consent, and mistaken belief in age, and reasonableness.

Proposed section 50EB(2) was intended to reflect a clear intention that, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, the defence and the prosecution should be allowed to seek the use of video link technology where the circumstances listed in proposed paragraphs 50EB(1)(a), (b) and (c) were met. The present provision adopts the committee's recommendation by combining the sections into one provision, removing the mandatory formulation and providing that any direction for the use of technology in a particular case must be consistent in the interests of justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. The coalition does not oppose the amendments proposed. I will just briefly comment on some matters mentioned by the minister. The government has rejected criticisms referred to in paragraphs 2.2.3, 2.2.4 and 2.2.6 of the advisory report on the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994 prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. However, I think the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) will readily understand that it was a very strong unanimous view of the committee that the bill in its original form was not appropriate and did not contain ordinary safeguards for persons accused of serious crime.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5T4">Mr Brereton</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has provided the following answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In its submission to the Public Works Committee in 1992 the FAC stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"It is not possible to confidently predict the amount of aircraft traffic which will be attracted to a new and uncongested airport at Badgerys Creek. Components of the demand could include the following:  scheduled passenger flights; charter services; instrument landing training; carriage of large or small freight items and express overnight parcel services. As stated earlier, the enhancement of capacity at Sydney Airport will mean that the market will not support the operation of Badgerys Creek as a major passenger airport before about the year 2010. However, it is anticipated that there will be a gradual increase in the number and size of aircraft using Badgerys Creek in the intervening years."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) No. The Corporation's view has always been that the timing of the development of Badgerys Creek would be driven by the level of demand in the Sydney Basin. According to the Environmental Impact Statement conducted for the parallel runway at Sydney, Badgerys Creek Airport would be viable in the long term when there were at least 25 million passenger movements at Sydney Airport and that by the time that Sydney Airport reached 30 million passenger movements, Badgerys Creek would have two million passenger movements. The Corporation's central forecasts, published in July 1993 show that Sydney Airport will reach 30 million passengers around 2010. This timing may change (either up or down) in subsequent forecasts depending on trends emerging in traffic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Forecasts, being predictions, are by their very nature imperfect. The Corporation is constantly reviewing and revising its forecasting methodology to ensure the forecasts are as accurate as forecasts can be. The Corporation updates its forecasts every year due to changes in the key economic variables affecting passenger and aircraft movements and developments in the industry. This may affect the indicative timings the Corporation originally provided to the Public Works Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Corporation uses its forecasts for capital expenditure planning, making it important that they are not over optimistic, it is equally important for the forecasts not to be over pessimistic as this would lead to the Corporation failing to meet its primary objective of providing for Australia's airport needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporation does compare the performance of its short term central forecasts against the actual growth in passenger movements. In general terms, the Corporation's short term central forecasts have tracked actual growth in passenger movements at all of the Corporation's airports reasonably well over the past six years. The performance of the Corporation's central forecasts in international passenger movements for 1992/93 can be seen in the following table which shows that actual growth in international passenger movements showed little variance from the forecast.</PARA>
